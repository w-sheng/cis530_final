From fairest creatures we desire increase,	1
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,	1
But as the riper should by time decease,	1
His tender heir might bear his memory:	1
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	1
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	1
Making a famine where abundance lies,	1
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	1
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	1
And only herald to the gaudy spring,	1
Within thine own bud buriest thy content	1
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	1
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	1
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	1

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,	1
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,	1
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,	1
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:	1
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,	1
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,	1
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,	1
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.	1
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,	1
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine	1
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'	1
Proving his beauty by succession thine!	1
This were to be new made when thou art old,	1
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.	1

Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest	1
Now is the time that face should form another;	1
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,	1
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.	1
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb	1
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?	1
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb	1
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?	1
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee	1
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:	1
So thou through windows of thine age shall see	1
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.	1
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,	1
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.	1

Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend	1
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?	1
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,	1
And being frank she lends to those are free.	1
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse	1
The bounteous largess given thee to give?	1
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use	1
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?	1
For having traffic with thyself alone,	1
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.	1
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,	1
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?	1
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,	1
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.	1

Those hours, that with gentle work did frame	1
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,	1
Will play the tyrants to the very same	1
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:	1
For never-resting time leads summer on	1
To hideous winter and confounds him there;	1
Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,	1
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:	1
Then, were not summer's distillation left,	1
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,	1
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,	1
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:	1
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,	1
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.	1

Then let not winter's ragged hand deface	1
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:	1
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place	1
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.	1
That use is not forbidden usury,	1
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;	1
That's for thyself to breed another thee,	1
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;	1
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,	1
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:	1
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,	1
Leaving thee living in posterity?	1
Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair	1
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.	1

Lo! in the orient when the gracious light	1
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye	1
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,	1
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;	1
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,	1
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,	1
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,	1
Attending on his golden pilgrimage;	1
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,	1
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,	1
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are	1
From his low tract and look another way:	1
So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,	1
Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.	1

Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?	1
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.	1
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,	1
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?	1
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,	1
By unions married, do offend thine ear,	1
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds	1
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.	1
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,	1
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,	1
Resembling sire and child and happy mother	1
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:	1
Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,	1
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'	1

Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye	1
That thou consumest thyself in single life?	1
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.	1
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;	1
The world will be thy widow and still weep	1
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,	1
When every private widow well may keep	1
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.	1
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend	1
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;	1
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,	1
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.	1
No love toward others in that bosom sits	1
That on himself such murderous shame commits.	1

For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,	1
Who for thyself art so unprovident.	1
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,	1
But that thou none lovest is most evident;	1
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate	1
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.	1
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	1
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.	1
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!	1
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	1
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,	1
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:	1
Make thee another self, for love of me,	1
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.	1

As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest	1
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;	1
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest	1
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.	1
Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:	1
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:	1
If all were minded so, the times should cease	1
And threescore year would make the world away.	1
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,	1
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:	1
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;	1
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:	1
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby	1
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.	1

When I do count the clock that tells the time,	1
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;	1
When I behold the violet past prime,	1
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;	1
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves	1
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,	1
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves	1
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,	1
Then of thy beauty do I question make,	1
That thou among the wastes of time must go,	1
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake	1
And die as fast as they see others grow;	1
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence	1
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.	1

O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are	1
No longer yours than you yourself here live:	1
Against this coming end you should prepare,	1
And your sweet semblance to some other give.	1
So should that beauty which you hold in lease	1
Find no determination: then you were	1
Yourself again after yourself's decease,	1
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.	1
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,	1
Which husbandry in honour might uphold	1
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day	1
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?	1
O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know	1
You had a father: let your son say so.	1

Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;	1
And yet methinks I have astronomy,	1
But not to tell of good or evil luck,	1
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;	1
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,	1
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,	1
Or say with princes if it shall go well,	1
By oft predict that I in heaven find:	1
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,	1
And, constant stars, in them I read such art	1
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,	1
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;	1
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:	1
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.	1

When I consider every thing that grows	1
Holds in perfection but a little moment,	1
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	1
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;	1
When I perceive that men as plants increase,	1
Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,	1
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,	1
And wear their brave state out of memory;	1
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay	1
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,	1
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,	1
To change your day of youth to sullied night;	1
And all in war with Time for love of you,	1
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.	1

He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!	0
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,	0
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.	0
I’m a child of the King,	0

My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,	0
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;	0

A tent or a cottage, why should I care?	0
They’re building a palace for me over there;	0
Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:	0
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.	0

O give us homes built firm upon the Saviour,	0
Where Christ is Head, and Counsellor and Guide;	0
Where ev'ry child is taught His love and favor	0
And gives his heart to Christ, the crucified:	0
How sweet to know that tho' his footsteps waver	0
His faithful Lord is walking by his side!	0
O give us homes with godly fathers, mothers,	0
Who always place their hope and trust in Him;	0
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,	0
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;	0
A home where each finds joy in serving others,	0
And love still shines, tho' days be dark and grim.	0
O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master,	0
The Bible read, the precious hymns still sung;	0
Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster,	0
And praise is natural speech to ev'ry tongue;	0
Where mountains move before a faith that's vaster,	0
And Christ sufficient is for old and young.	0
O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever!	0
We trust to Thee their problems, toil, and care;	0
Their bonds of love no enemy can sever	0
If Thou art always Lord and Master there:	0
Be Thou the center of our least endeavor:	0
Be Thou our Guest, our hearts and homes to share.	0

The Christ-child lay on Mary's lap,	0
His hair was like a light.	0
O weary, weary were the world,	0
But here is all aright.	0
The Christ-child lay on Mary's breast,	0
His hair was like a star.	0
O stern and cunning are the kings,	0
But here the true hearts are.	0
The Christ-child lay on Mary's heart	0
His hair was like a fire.	0
O weary, weary is the world,	0
But here the world's desire.	0
The Christ-child stood at Mary's knee,	0
His hair was like a crown,	0
And all the flowers looked up at Him,	0
And all the stars looked down.	0

A city radiant as a bride	0
and bright with gold and gem,	0
a crystal river clear and wide,	0
the new Jerusalem;	0
a city wrought of wealth untold,	0
her jeweled walls aflame	0
with green and amethyst and gold	0
and colors none can name.	0
A holy city, clear as glass,	0
where saints in glory dwell.	0
Through gates of pearl her people pass	0
to fields of asphodel.	0
In robes of splendor, pure and white,	0
they walk the golden flood,	0
where God himself shall be their light	0
and night shall be no more.	0
A city ever new and fair,	0
the Lamb's eternal bride;	0
no suffering or grief is there	0
and every tear is dried.	0
There Christ prepares for us a place,	0
from sin and death restored,	0
and we shall stand before his face,	0
the ransomed of the Lord.	0

Gathered round Your table on this holy eve,	0
Viewing Bethlehem's stable we rejoice and grieve;	0
Joy to see You lying in Your manger bed,	0
Weep to see You dying in our sinful stead.	0
Prince of Glory, gracing Heav'n ere time began,	0
Now for us embracing death as Son of Man;	0
By Your birth so lowly, by Your love so true,	0
By Your cross most holy, Lord, we worship You!	0
Bethlehem's Incarnation, Calvary's bitter cross,	0
Wrought for us salvation by Your pain and loss;	0
Now we fall before You in this holy place,	0
Prostrate we adore You, for Your gift of grace.	0
With profoundest wonder we Your body take--	0
Laid in manger yonder, broken for our sake:	0
Hushed in adoration we approach the cup--	0
Bethlehem's pure oblation freely offered up.	0
Christmas Babe so tender, Lamb who bore our blame,	0
How shall sinners render praises due Your name?	0
Do Your own good pleasure in the lives we bring;	0
In Your ransomed treasure reign forever King!	0

Shall I wear that bright crown God has offered to me,	0
When my life shall have come to a close?	0
Oh, how happy I’ll be when my spirit is free,	0
Over there in such blissful repose.	0
Yes, I will wear a crown over there, over there,	0
Yes, I will wear a crown over there;	0
When my toiling is o’er I shall rest evermore,	0
In that home He has gone to prepare.	0
Shall I trust Him alway? Yes, the promise is mine,	0
“Be thou faithful, my child, unto death,	0
And I’ll give thee a crown which forever shall shine,	0
Endless life at thy last, fleeting breath."	0
Let my anchor be grounded so deep in the Rock,	0
Till the storms of this life all are past,	0
That I’ll firmly endure on the promise secure,	0
Till He brings me to glory at last.	0

A debtor to mercy alone,	0
Of covenant mercy I sing,	0
Nor fear, with God's righteousness on,	0
My person and off'rings to bring.	0
The terrors of law and of God	0
With me can have nothing to do;	0
My Savior's obedience and blood	0
Hide all my transgressions from view.	0
The work which His goodness began,	0
The arm of His strength will complete;	0
His promise is Yea and Amen,	0
And never was forfeited yet.	0
Things future, nor things that are now,	0
Not all things below or above,	0
Can make Him His purpose forego,	0
Or sever my soul from His love.	0
My name from the palms of His hands	0
Eternity will not erase;	0
Imprest on His heart, it remains	0
In marks of indelible grace.	0
Yes! I to the end shall endure,	0
As sure as the earnest is giv'n;	0
More happy, but not more secure,	0
When all earthly ties have been riv'n.	0

I've sung everything from hard times to heaven	0
To the cold winds that chilled my very soul	0
& I've sung everything from lonely nights in taverns	0
To dime store women on the troll	0
& I've sung everything from sunshine to sadness	0
From the good life to the hells of Bob McVee	0
Now I sing a different song & tell a different story	0
'Cause Jesus sang a different song to me	0
& he said he'd meet me_______________	0

In the mornin'	0

In the sweet still shadows of his love	0
He said he'd meet me_______________	0

In the mornin'	0

In the warm soft goodness of his love	0
I've read it in the pages of Matthew, Mark & Proverbs	0
Daniel, Revelation, Timothy	0
& the wisdom I discovered from cover to cover	0
Was enough to scare the Devil out of me	0
The words all have reason	0
& they're never out of season	0
They're the sweetest written words you'll ever hear	0
Since I've been readin' Jesus	0
I read a different story	0
'Cause Jesus, he's been readin' me for years	0
Coda:	0
In the warm soft goodness of his love	0
Of his love___, of his love	0
