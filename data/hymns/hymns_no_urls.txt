A babe lies in the cradle,
a little babe so dear,
with noble light he shineth
as shines a mirror clear,
this little babe so dear.
The babe within the cradle
is Jesus Christ our Lord;
to us all peace and amity
at this good time afford,
thou Jesus Christ our Lord!
Whoso would rock the cradle
where lies the gentle child,
a lowly heart must lead him,
by passions undefiled,
as Mary pure and mild.
O Jesus, babe beloved!
O Jesus, babe divine!
How mighty is thy wondrous love!
Fill thou this heart of mine
with that great love of thine!

There's a beautiful home, far over the sea,
There are mansions of (Dbliss, for you and for me,
Oh that beautiful home, so wonderf'ly fair,
That the savior for (Dme, has gone to pre- pare.
(echo first part of each line, part with " marks)
"There's a beautiful home", far over the sea,
"There's a beautiful (Dhome", for you and for me,
"And it's glittering pow'r", the sun out- shines,
"And that beautiful (Dhome", someday shall be mine.
In that beautiful home, a crown I shall wear,
When the glorified throne, that glory to share,
But the joys of that home, can never be known,
'Till the savior we see, upon his white throne.

Each day I'll do a golden deed,
By helping those who are in need;
My life on earth is but a span,
And so I'll do the best I can.
Life's evening sun is sinking low,
A few more days, and I must go
To meet the deeds that I have done,
Where there will be no setting sun.
To be a child of God each day,
My light must shine along the way;
I'll sing His praise while ages roll,
And strive to help some troubled soul.
The only life that will endure,
Is one that's kind and good and pure;
And so for God I'll take my stand,
Each day I'll lend a helping hand.
I'll help someone in time of need,
And journey on with rapid speed;
I'll help the sick and poor and weak,
And words of kindness to them speak.
While going down life's weary road,
I'll try to lift some trav'ler's load;
I'll try to turn the night to day,
Make flowers bloom along the way.

Years 
have flown by, memories have remained, 
I've gone through situations that no one can explain, 
I thought in my mind that this would never attend, 
I have gone through the loss of a very close friend, 
Trying to be strong and hold back the tears, 
walking by others who have a face of fear, 
With arms wide open and love poured out , 
This could be the end I have no doubt, 
I don't know where to go or what to do, I
 can't let go of the things I'm going through.
Pain and Fear is always in my way, 
It hurts to know all the things in life that change, 
Good or Bad.You'll always become stronger, 
Let God take control.For he will make you whole, 
He is your life and living water, 
Even a loving Father, 
He'll make you have a Better Day.
I went to school that very next day, 
It was hard to realize that life was so short away, 
It was just so hard to see, My heart was beating so quickly, 
they were their one minute gone the next, 
The bell rang we all went to class, 
Not a word was spoken it went by so fast, 
We all bowed our heads tears rolled down our eyes, 
For God was with us right by our sides, 
I just can't explain, just can't explain the way I feel.
Pain and Fear is always in my way, 
It hurts to know all the things in life that change, 
Good or Bad.You'll always become stronger, 
Let God take control.For he will make you whole, 
He is your life and living water, 
Even a loving Father, 
He'll make you have a better day.
For He will make you whole, 
and it will be a Better Day.A Better Day.

A Bible Christian I will be,
For Christ has done so much for me;
Then how could I my Lord deny,
And on the words of men rely?
The Bible’s good enough for me,
The Bible’s truth my creed shall be;
From human creeds I turn away,
I stand for Christ alone today.
Tho’ many follow human plans,
Believe the creeds set up by man;
No other creed have I today
Than Christ, who is the Truth, the Way.
The Word by inspiration giv’n,
The chart that points the way to Heav’n;
On this I dare and will depend,
And with my life its truth defend.
Believe in Christ, repent of sin,
Confess your faith, and peace you’ll win;
Then ’neath the water with Him go,
And you His peace and joy shall know.

When I came into this world, I just can't recall
I don't remember anything about my birth at all
But one day, on my knees in prayer, I just never will forget
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget
Oh, but to the world it made no difference,
Some might even frown
But the angels, they rejoiced,
When my name was written down
Unworthy of His mercy, but yet He paid the debt
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget
Well, it never made the papers, it never made the evening news
When I took off the old man, and I put on the new
My sins were cast into forgetfulness, as the East is from the West
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget

A brighter dawn is breaking,
and earth with praise is waking;
for thou, O King most highest,
the power of death defiest;
and thou hast come victorious,
with risen Body glorious,
who now for ever livest,
and life abundant givest.
O free the world from blindness,
and fill the world with kindness,
give sinners resurrection,
bring striving to perfection;
in sickness give us healing,
in doubt thy clear revealing,
that praise to thee be given
in earth as in thy heaven.

Up, away to the harvest field,
Gather in the golden yield;
Gird your armor and faithful be,
For the Master calleth thee.
Thrust your sickle in, the harvest time is here,
Labor with your might, the judgment day is near;
Thrust your sickle in, the grain is falling fast,
Haste, ere harvest time is past.
Always take with you faith’s bright shield,
And your sickle bravely wield;
Stand against cunning foes you see,
For the Master calleth thee.
Keep uplifted the word of truth,
Spreading light to hopeful youth;
Bowed to Him must be every knee,
For the Master calleth thee.
Take with you holy peace and love,
Lift despairing souls above;
Toil to make sinful mortals free,
For the Master calleth thee.

Softly the evening vespers
Hallow the closing day;
Sweetly the Savior whispers,
“Come to the throne and pray." 
Softly I hear Him calling,
Calling at close of day;
Sweetly His tones are falling,
“Come to the throne and pray." 
Come, ere the shadows lengthen,
Bring Him thy burdened heart;
Come where His grace may strengthen,
Come from thy cares apart.
Smiles of His love await thee,
Lighting His lovely face;
Just to behold His beauty,
Dwell in the secret place.
Boldly we may approach Him,
Mercy and grace to own;
Tempted like us, He bid us
Come to the Father’s throne.
 

A charge to keep I have, 
a God to glorify,
a never-dying soul to save,
and fit it for the sky.
To serve the present age,
my calling to fulfill;
O may it all my powers engage
to do my Master's will!
Arm me with jealous care,
as in thy sight to live,
and O, thy servant, Lord, prepare
a strict account to give!
Help me to watch and pray,
and on thyself rely;
assured, if I my trust betray,
I shall forever die.
 

A Child is born in Bethlehem,
in Bethlehem.
And gladness fills Jerusalem,
Allelujah, allelujah!
A lowly manger shelters Him,
This Holy Boy.
God's angels sing above with joy,
Allelujah, allelujah!
We now give thanks eternally,
Eternaly.
to God, the Holy Trinity,
Allelujah, allelujah! 
The work which His goodness began,
The arm of His strength will complete;
His promise is Yea and Amen,
And never was forfeited yet.
Things future, nor things that are now,
Not all things below or above,
Can make Him His purpose forego,
Or sever my soul from His love.
My name from the palms of His hands
Eternity will not erase;
Imprest on His heart, it remains
In marks of indelible grace.
Yes! I to the end shall endure,
As sure as the earnest is giv'n;
More happy, but not more secure,
When all earthly ties have been riv'n.
 

Praise the Lord! my heart with His love is beaming,
I am a child of God;
Heaven’s golden light over me is streaming,
I am a child of God.
I am a child of God,
I am a child of God;
I have washed my robes in the cleansing fountain,
I am a child of God.
Let the saints rejoice with my raptured spirit,
I am a child of God;
I will testify that the world may hear it,
I am a child of God.
Let a holy life tell the gospel story,
I am a child of God;
How He fills the soul with His grace and glory,
I am a child of God.
Saved from sin today, every band is riven,
I am a child of God;
Through the tests of life I have peace from heaven,
I am a child of God.
 

My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.
I’m a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I’m a child of the King.
My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
That we may be His, when He comes by and by.
I once was an outcast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.
A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They’re building a palace for me over there;
Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.
 

The 
skies shout with thunder
The seas crash in waves
All nature rings with sounds of God
From raindrops small to mountains tall
Sing praise to our God almighty.
A lion roars in warning
Her cub cries for food
All nature rings with sounds of God
From insects small to creatures tall
Sing praise to our God almighty.
A child prays at bedtime
And wakes bright as dawn
All children ring with sounds of God
From infant small to teenage tall
Sing praise to our God almighty.

O give us homes built firm upon the Saviour,
Where Christ is Head, and Counsellor and Guide;
Where ev'ry child is taught His love and favor
And gives his heart to Christ, the crucified:
How sweet to know that tho' his footsteps waver
His faithful Lord is walking by his side!
O give us homes with godly fathers, mothers,
Who always place their hope and trust in Him;
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;
A home where each finds joy in serving others,
And love still shines, tho' days be dark and grim.
O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master,
The Bible read, the precious hymns still sung;
Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster,
And praise is natural speech to ev'ry tongue;
Where mountains move before a faith that's vaster,
And Christ sufficient is for old and young.
O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever!
We trust to Thee their problems, toil, and care;
Their bonds of love no enemy can sever
If Thou art always Lord and Master there:
Be Thou the center of our least endeavor:
Be Thou our Guest, our hearts and homes to share.

The Christ-child lay on Mary's lap,
His hair was like a light.
(O weary, weary were the world,
But here is all aright.) 
The Christ-child lay on Mary's breast,
His hair was like a star.
(O stern and cunning are the kings,
But here the true hearts are.)
The Christ-child lay on Mary's heart
His hair was like a fire.
(O weary, weary is the world,
But here the world's desire.)
The Christ-child stood at Mary's knee,
His hair was like a crown,
And all the flowers looked up at Him,
And all the stars looked down.

A city radiant as a bride
and bright with gold and gem,
a crystal river clear and wide,
the new Jerusalem;
a city wrought of wealth untold,
her jeweled walls aflame
with green and amethyst and gold
and colors none can name.
A holy city, clear as glass,
where saints in glory dwell.
Through gates of pearl her people pass
to fields of asphodel.
In robes of splendor, pure and white,
they walk the golden flood,
where God himself shall be their light
and night shall be no more.
A city ever new and fair,
the Lamb's eternal bride;
no suffering or grief is there
and every tear is dried.
There Christ prepares for us a place,
from sin and death restored,
and we shall stand before his face,
the ransomed of the Lord.

Gathered round Your table on this holy eve,
Viewing Bethlehem's stable we rejoice and grieve;
Joy to see You lying in Your manger bed,
Weep to see You dying in our sinful stead.
Prince of Glory, gracing Heav'n ere time began,
Now for us embracing death as Son of Man;
By Your birth so lowly, by Your love so true,
By Your cross most holy, Lord, we worship You!
Bethlehem's Incarnation, Calvary's bitter cross,
Wrought for us salvation by Your pain and loss;
Now we fall before You in this holy place,
Prostrate we adore You, for Your gift of grace.
With profoundest wonder we Your body take--
Laid in manger yonder, broken for our sake:
Hushed in adoration we approach the cup--
Bethlehem's pure oblation freely offered up.
Christmas Babe so tender, Lamb who bore our blame,
How shall sinners render praises due Your name?
Do Your own good pleasure in the lives we bring;
In Your ransomed treasure reign forever King!

Shall I wear that bright crown God has offered to me,
When my life shall have come to a close?
Oh, how happy I’ll be when my spirit is free,
Over there in such blissful repose.
Yes, I will wear a crown over there, over there,
Yes, I will wear a crown over there;
When my toiling is o’er I shall rest evermore,
In that home He has gone to prepare.
Shall I trust Him alway? Yes, the promise is mine,
“Be thou faithful, my child, unto death,
And I’ll give thee a crown which forever shall shine,
Endless life at thy last, fleeting breath." 
Let my anchor be grounded so deep in the Rock,
Till the storms of this life all are past,
That I’ll firmly endure on the promise secure,
Till He brings me to glory at last.

A debtor to mercy alone,
Of covenant mercy I sing,
Nor fear, with God's righteousness on,
My person and off'rings to bring.
The terrors of law and of God
With me can have nothing to do;
My Savior's obedience and blood
Hide all my transgressions from view.
The work which His goodness began,
The arm of His strength will complete;
His promise is Yea and Amen,
And never was forfeited yet.
Things future, nor things that are now,
Not all things below or above,
Can make Him His purpose forego,
Or sever my soul from His love.
My name from the palms of His hands
Eternity will not erase;
Imprest on His heart, it remains
In marks of indelible grace.
Yes! I to the end shall endure,
As sure as the earnest is giv'n;
More happy, but not more secure,
When all earthly ties have been riv'n.

I've sung everything from hard times to heaven
To the cold winds that chilled my very soul
& I've sung everything from lonely nights in taverns
To dime store women on the troll
& I've sung everything from sunshine to sadness
From the good life to the hells of Bob McVee
Now I sing a different song & tell a different story
'Cause Jesus sang a different song to me
& he said he'd meet me_______________
(Meet me in the mornin')
In the mornin'
(Meet me in the mornin')
In the sweet still shadows of his love (of his love)
He said he'd meet me_______________
(Meet me in the mornin')
In the mornin'
(Meet me in the mornin')
In the warm soft goodness of his love
I've read it in the pages of Matthew, Mark & Proverbs
Daniel, Revelation, Timothy
& the wisdom I discovered from cover to cover
Was enough to scare the Devil out of me
The words all have reason
& they're never out of season
They're the sweetest written words you'll ever hear
Since I've been readin' Jesus
I read a different story
'Cause Jesus, he's been readin' me for years
In the warm soft goodness of his love
Of his love___, of his love

A Bible Christian I will be,

A fervent prayer rose up to heaven,
A fragile soul was losing ground
Sorting through this earthly babble,
Heaven heard the sound.
It was a life of no distinction,
No successes, only tries.
Yet, gazing down on this unlovely one,
There was love in Heaven's Eyes.
The orphaned child, the wayward father,
The homeless traveler in the rain
When life goes by and no one bothers,
Heaven feels the pain.
Looking down, God sees each heartache,
Knows each sorrow, hears each cry,
And looking up, we'll see compassion's
Fire ablaze in Heaven's Eyes.
In Heaven's Eyes, there are no losers,
In Heaven's Eyes, no hopeless cause.
Only people like you, with feelings like me
And we're amazed at the grace we can find
In Heaven's Eyes.

A Few more days on earth to spend.
And all my toils and cares shall end,
And I shall see my God and Friend,
And praise His name on high;
No more to sigh or shed a tear,
No more to suffer pain or fear,
But God, and Christ, and heav'n appear
Unto the raptured eye.
Then, O my soul, despond no more,
The storm of life will soon be o'er.
And I shall find the peaceful shore,
Of everlasting rest,
O happy day, O joyful hour!
When freed from earth my soul shall tow'r
Beyond the reach of Satan's pow'r.
To be forever blest.
My soul anticipates the day;
I'll joyfully the call obey
Which comes to summon me away
To seats prepared above;
There I shall see my Saviour's face,
And dwell in his beloved embrace,
And taste the fullness of his grace,
And sing redeeming love.

A few more years shall roll,
A few more seasons come,
And we shall be with those that rest
Asleep within the tomb;
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that great day.
O wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.
A few more suns shall set
O'er these dark hills of time,
And we shall be where suns are not
A far serener clime:
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that blest day.
O wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.
A few more storms shall beat
On this wild rocky shore,
And we shall be where tempests cease,
And surges swell no more;
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that calm day.
O wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.
A few more struggles here,
A few more partings o'er,
A few more toils, a few more tears,
And we shall weep no more:
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that bright day.
O wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.
'Tis but a little while,
And He shall come again
Who died that we might live, Who lives
That we with Him may reign;
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that glad day.
O wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

A foolish king for his own praise,
An image made of gold, 
Then bade all to bow down their heads, 
but three alone stood bold.
And so the king in might rage-- 
He cast them in the flame.
Yet God saved them from scorching fire, 
And death the overcame.
O Father, those men like your Son, 
Would not to Satan bend.
If we for Your sake risk our lives, 
Will our lives you defend? 
My soul is set at rest because 
Your Word has promised those, 
Who through The Son come unto you 
Shall conquer all their foes.

A great and mighty wonder,
a full and holy cure!
The Virgin bears the Infant
with virgin-honor pure:
 "To God on high be glory,
and peace on earth to men."
The Word becomes incarnate,
and yet remains on high;
and cherubim sing anthems
to shepherds from the sky; 
While thus they sing your Monarch,
those bright angelic bands,
rejoice, ye vales and mountains,
ye oceans, clap your hands: 
Since all he comes to ransom,
by all be he adored,
the infant born in Bethlehem,
the Savior and the Lord: 

If I was a preaching man, I tell you what I'd do:
I'd preach the truth throughout the land
and work on a building, too.
I'm working on a building, I'm working on a building,
I'm working on a building for my Lord, for my Lord!
It's a Holy Ghost building, it's a Holy Ghost building,
It's a Holy Ghost building, for my Lord, for my Lord!
If I was a carpenter I tell you what I'd do:
I'd work all day and work all night
just to work on the building, too.
I'm working on a building, I'm working on a building,
I'm working on a building for my Lord, for my Lord!
It's a Holy Ghost building, it's a Holy Ghost building,
It's a Holy Ghost building, for my Lord, for my Lord!
If I was a ramblin' man, I tell you what I'd do:
I'd stop my rambling, stop my gambling,
and work on a building, too.
I'm working on a building, I'm working on a building,
I'm working on a building for my Lord, for my Lord!
It's a Holy Ghost building, it's a Holy Ghost building,
It's a Holy Ghost building, for my Lord, for my Lord!
If I was gambling man, I tell you what I'd do:
I'd throw away the Queen of Spades
and work on a building, too.
I'm working on a building, I'm working on a building,
I'm working on a building for my Lord, for my Lord!
It's a Holy Ghost building, it's a Holy Ghost building,
It's a Holy Ghost building, for my Lord, for my Lord!
If I was a sinner man, I tell you what I'd do:
I'd stop my sinning, start my praying,
and work on a building, too.
I'm working on a building, I'm working on a building,
I'm working on a building for my Lord, for my Lord!
It's a Holy Ghost building, it's a Holy Ghost building,
It's a Holy Ghost building, for my Lord, for my Lord!

A Home in heav'n! what a joyful thought!
As the poor man toils in his weary lot;
His heart oppressed, and with anguish riv'n,
From his home below to a home in heav'n.
A home in heav'n! as the suff'rer lies
On his bed of pain, and uplifts his eyes
To that bright home what a joy is giv'n.
With the blessed thought of a home in heav'n.
A home in heav'n! when our pleasures fade,
And our wealth and fame in the dust are laid,
And our strength decays, and our health is riv'n,
We are happy still with our home in heav'n.
A home in heav'n! when the sinner mourns,
And with contrite heart to the Saviour turns;
O then what bliss in that heart forgiv'n,
Does the hope inspire of a home in heav'n!
A home in heav'n! when our friends are fled
To the cheerless home of the mould'ring dead;
We wait in hope of the promise giv'n,
We will meet again in our home in heav'n.

In the twinkling of an eye 
My Lord will come for you and I 
We know not when that day will be 
When Jesus comes and sets us free 
Be prepared each minute and day 
Look for the sign he's on his way 
Rejoice and praise his Holy name 
Don't seek riches nor not fame 
He will come upon a horse white 
For all to see by day or night 
The rapture finally is close at hand 
Stand your guard my mortal man 
In the twinkling of an eye 
My Lord will come for you and I 
We know not when that day will be 
When Jesus comes and sets us free 

People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy.
But they don't know on the Judgment Day
That Gold and silver will melt away
I'd rather be in a deep dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved.
Than to live in this world in a House of Gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
What good is Gold and silver, too
If your heart's not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray 

A hymn of glory let us sing, 
new hymns throughout the world shall ring;
by a new way none ever trod
Christ takes his place--the throne of God!
You are a present joy, O Lord;
you will be ever our reward;
and great the light in you we see
to guide us to eternity.
O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
all praise to you let earth accord,
who are, while endless ages run,
with Father and with Spirit, One.

O God, inspire our morning hymn
Of love and gratitude;
Oh, bless the sacrifice we bring,
Thou Source of every good.
Touched by Thy hand of love, we wake,
And rise from sweet repose;
Thy praise shall first the silence break,
Thy peace within us flows.
Thy miracle of love so sweet
Preserved us all secure;
While helpless in unconscious sleep,
Thy presence kept us pure.
’Tis blest to rise, O Lord, and join
With nature’s minstrelsy;
To hymn Thy praise at early morn,
And offer thanks to Thee.
Sweet morning is the time to pray;
How lovely and how meet,
To send our early thoughts away
Up to the mercy seat.
The glorious sun has driven far
The mystic shades of night;
So in our souls the morning star
Hath shed His wondrous light.

A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth,
The guilt of all men bearing;
And laden with the sins of earth,
None else the burden sharing!
Goes patient on, grow weak and faint,
To slaughter led without complaint,
That spotless life to offer;
Bears shame and stripes, and wounds and death,
Anguish and mockery, and saith,
"Willing all this I suffer." 
This Lamb is Christ, the soul's great Friend,
The Lamb of God, our Savior;
Him God the Father chose to send
To gain for us His favor.
"Go forth, My Son," the Father saith,
"And free men from the fear of death,
From guilt and condemnation.
The wrath and stripes are hard to bear,
But by Thy Passion men shall share
The fruit of Thy salvation." 
"Yea, Father, yea, most willingly
I'll bear what Thou commandest;
My will conforms to Thy decree,
I do what Thou demandest."
O wondrous Love, what hast Thou done!
The Father offers up His Son!
The Son, content, descendeth!
O Love, how strong Thou art to save!
Thou beddest Him within the grave
Whose word the mountains rendeth.
From morn till eve my theme shall be
Thy mercy's wondrous measure;
To sacrifice myself for Thee
Shall be my aim and pleasure.
My stream of life shall ever be
A current flowing ceaselessly,
Thy constant praise outpouring.
I'll treasure in my memory,
O Lord, all Thou hast done for me,
Thy gracious love adoring.
Of death I am no more afraid,
New life from Thee is flowing;
Thy cross affords me cooling shade
When noonday's sun is glowing.
When by my grief I am opprest,
On Thee my weary soul shall rest
Serenely as on pillows.
Thou art my Anchor when by woe
My bark is driven to and fro
On trouble's surging billows.
And when Thy glory I shall see
And taste Thy kingdom's pleasure,
Thy blood my royal robe shall be,
My joy beyond all measure.
When I appear before Thy throne,
Thy righteousness shall be my crown,-
With these I need not hide me.
And there, in garments richly wrought
As Thine own bride, I shall be brought
To stand in joy beside Thee.

Just before His trial, Jesus entered dark Gethsemane;
Leaving eight outside, took Peter and two sons of Zebedee.
Oh, the anguish in the garden, as again He left the three;
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary! 
Let us go a little farther, farther than we’ve gone before;
Are we workers now for Jesus? Let us do a little more.
See Him praying, hear him groaning; death sweeps o’er Him like a flood;
“Let this cup pass from me, Father"—sweat runs down as drops of blood!
“Not my will, Lord, I will drink it: let Thy will be done in me."
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary! 
Then at Pilate’s hall, behold Him, as the mob who mocked him cried,
“Away, away, give us Barabbas; let this Christ be crucified!"
Oh, Barabbas, oh, Barabbas, Jesus surely died for thee,
When He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary! 
Now He marches to Golgotha, scourged and thorn-crowned on the road;
Bears the cross upon His shoulder, sinks beneath the heavy load!
Mocked, reviled, by friends forsaken—all for you, and all for me—
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary!

O a little talk with Jesus make it right, all right
Little talk with Jesus make it right, all right
Troubles of ev’ry kind
Hank God I’ll always find
That little talk with Jesus make it right.
My brother, I remember when I was a sinner lost
I cried, “Have mercy, Jesus"
But still my soul was tossed
Till I heard King Jesus say,
“Come here, I’m on the way"
And little talk with Jesus make it right.
Sometimes the fork lightning and muttering thunder, too
Of trials and temptations
Make it hard for me and you
But Jesus was a friend,
He’ll keep us to the end
And little talk with Jesus make it right.
My brother and my sister, you have trials like me
When we are trying to serve the Lord
And win the victory
Old Satan fight us hard
Our journey to retard
But little talk with Jesus make it right.

In this world I walk alone
With no place to call my home
But there's one who holds my hand
The rugged road through barren lands
The way is dark the road is steep
But He's become my eyes to see
The strength to climb my grief's to bear
The Savior lives inside me there
In Your love I find release
A haven from my unbelief
Take my life and let me be
A living prayer my God to Thee
(Take my life and let me be 
a living prayer my God to Thee)
In these trials of life I find
Another voice inside my mind
He comforts me and bids me live
Inside the love the Father gives

I love the Christ, the Son of God,
Who died that I might live;
I would my gratitude express,
A gift unto Him give.
My gift is small, it is my all,
Accept it, Lord, I pray;
Let self be slain, let Jesus reign
Within my heart alway.
I fail to find a sacrifice,
Or fitting gift to bring;
Earth’s treasures have too little worth
To offer to my King.
No gift, however grand or great,
Could pay the debt I owe;
I bring myself, my life, my all,
A living gift bestow.
My members all I gladly yield
For service, Lord, to Thee;
To bear the blessed gospel light,
That others Christ may see.

A long time ago, there was a man
Who laid his life on the line
He claimed he could make the lame walk again
And give back the sight to the blind
Now some people loved him
Some people wanted to take him and put him away
Well I wasn't there to see what he did
But if he was right here today.
I would crawl all the way to the river
I would crawl all the way to the sea
Just to watch him walk on the water
And lay his loving hands on me.
A carpenter by trade, but the kingdom that he made
Was built without hammer and nail
It stands like a rock though the ages of time
It was built with a love that never fails
I read in the good book that some day he's coming
And some say it ain't far away
On the day that he stands on the banks of the Jordan
I know I will be on my way

A mansion is waiting in glory,
My Savior has gone to prepare;
The ransomed who shine in its beauty,
Will dwell in that city so fair.
Oh, home above,
I’m going to dwell in that home;
Oh, home of love,
Get ready, poor sinner, and come.
A mansion of rest for the weary,
Who toil in the vineyard of love;
O sinner, believe, and be ready
To enter that mansion above.
A mansion where heavenly music
Enraptures the glorified throng;
They’re singing salvation, O sinner,
Come, join in that beautiful song.
A mansion where angels are waiting
To welcome the holy and true,
And when to the Savior low kneeling,
They’ll sing a sweet anthem for you.
A mansion unclouded by sorrow,
Undimmed by the pains of farewell,
Where all of earth’s pilgrims will gather,
With Christ in His glory to dwell.

Take this message to my mother
It will fill her heart with joy
Tell her that I've met my Saviour
God has saved her wand'ring boy.
The tears and sorrow I have caused her
How I wish I could re-pay
But tell her I'll be waiting for her
We'll meet in heaven some glad day.
How she cried when I left her
I know it filled her heart with pain
She said, "Son, please don't leave me
For we may never meet again."
Years have passed since that parting
But I know she waits and prays
Soon I'll cross that dark river
Please let her know that I was saved.

A mighty fortress is our God, 
a bulwark never failing;
Our helper he, amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe 
doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great, 
and, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.
Did we in our strength confide, 
our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, 
the Man of God's own choosing:
Dost ask who that may be? 
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabbaoth, His Name, 
from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.
And though this world, with devils filled, 
should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed 
his truth to triumph through us:
the Prince of Darkness grim, 
we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, 
for lo, his doom is sure,
one little word shall fell him.
That word above all earthly powers, 
no thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours 
through Him Who with us sideth:
Let good and kindred go, 
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill: 
God's truth abideth still,
his kingdom is forever.

All my life long I had panted
For a draught from some cool spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
Through His life I now am saved.
Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.
Poor I was, and sought for riches,
Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me
Only mocked my soul's sad cry.
Well of water, ever springing,
Bread of life, so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.

A mighty mystery we set forth,
A wondrous sign and seal;
Lord, give our hearts to know its worth,
And all its truth to feel.
Death to the world we thus avow,
Death to each sinful lust;
The risen life is our life now,
The risen Christ our trust.
Baptised into the Father's name,
We're children of our God;
Baptised into the Son, we claim
The ransom of his blood.
Baptised into the Holy Ghost,
In this accepted hour,
Give us to own the Pentecost,
And the descending power.

There is going to be a brand new morning.
There is going to be a brand new day.
Rest assured that day is coming 
when Jesus comes to take me away.
The angels are rejoicing in heaven 
They have waited so long for me.
I'm been working to get my life in order 
Now I'm ready for the jubilee.
When they open the gates in heaven 
He will descend on a beautiful cloud.
His arms will be open to me 
As the trumpets sound out loud.
The thorns that once adorned his brow for all the world to see.
Will be a golden crown for him to wear for all eternity.
First verse.

For a fresh anointing, Lord, for service
Come we now in Jesus’ precious name;
For the blessed Pentecostal fullness,
Every heart with heav’nly love aflame.
Send a new touch of fire on our souls, Lord,
Send it now, Lord, send it now, Lord;
Touch our lips today with the living coals,
Send a new touch of fire on our souls.
Make us free to tell the gospel story,
Liberty in service may we have;
Showing forth the Savior’s grace and glory,
Telling of His wondrous pow’r to save.
Bringing all we have in consecration
As a living sacrifice for Thee;
Trusting for an uttermost salvation,
Jesus’ precious blood our only plea.
Let the great Refiner throughly purge us,
Purify our hearts like as by fire;
While for all the sanctifying fullness
Here our waiting, longing hearts aspire.

A Pilgrim and a Stranger,
I journey here below;
Far distant is my country,
The home to which I go.
Here I must toil and travail,
Oft weary and opprest;
But there my God shall lead me
To everlasting rest.
I've met with storms and danger
E'en from my early years,
With enemies and conflicts,
With fightings and with fears.
There's nothing here that tempts me
To wish a longer stay,
So I must hasten forward,
No halting or delay.
It is a well-worn pathway;
A host has gone before,
The holy saints and prophets,
The patriarchs of yore.
They trod the toilsome journey
In patience and in faith;
And them I fain would follow,
Like them in life and death.
Who would share Abraham's blessing
Must Abraham's path pursue,
A stranger and a pilgrim,
Like him, must journey through.
The foes must be encountered,
The dangers must be passed;
A faithful soldier only
Receives the crown at last.
So I must hasten forward,-
Thank God, the end will come!
This land of passing shadows
Is not my destined home.
The everlasting city,
Jerusalem above,
This evermore abideth,
The home of light and love.
There still my thoughts are dwelling,
'Tis there I long to be;
Come, Lord, and call Thy servant
To blessedness with Thee.
Come, bid my toils be ended,
Let all my wanderings cease;
Call from the wayside lodging
To Thy sweet home of peace.
There I shall dwell forever,
No more a parting guest,
With all thy blood-bought children
In everlasting rest,
The pilgrim toils forgotten,
The pilgrim conflicts o'er,
All earthly griefs behind me,
Eternal joys before.

Oh, Lord,~ I Humbly come to you in Prayer, 
For Those who need a special touch to know you care, Send an Angel~
with a blessing from above, sprinkle them with a portion of your love
There are Christians who are discouraged, broken hearts to often now are found.
So I'm praying to you, Jesus mend their broken hearts and keep them heaven 
bound.
Help me know Lord, when your are calling, lay a burden on my heart for those who 
need.
For I am willing to pray for others, for in my weakness, I know others pray for 
me.

Savior, Thou art life to me,
Guard me by Thy watchful eye;
Ever by Thy Spirit be
Thou a guide to worlds on high.
Hide me from the storms of life;
Keep me from the tempter’s snare;
And while here ’mid toil and strife,
Let me cast on Thee my care.
Help me, Lord, to faithful be,
Give me grace to do Thy will;
That through all eternity,
Holy love my soul may thrill.
For though blest by worldly store,
Sanctioned by the creeds of men;
Jesus says, “I am the door,"—
He alone can save from sin.
Teach me from Thy blessed Word
Lessons precious to my soul;
Help me understand it, Lord,
By it make and keep me whole.
By Thy Word we stand or fall,
By Thy Word we live or die;
If in part and not by all,
Then we make His word a lie.
Oh, Thou art my refuge here,
All my hopes are built on Thee;
From all sin and slavish fear
Jesus makes me fully free.
So when all my toils are o’er,
Let me gain that blest abode;
And with loved ones gone before,
Ever dwell with me, my God.

Praise be to You, O Lord
God of our father Israel
From everlasting to everlasting
Yours, O Lord, is the greatness (is the greatness)
And the power (and the power)
And the glory (and the glory)
And the majesty
And the splendor (splendor)
For everything in heaven and earth is Yours 
Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom (is the Kingdom)
You are exalted as head over all
Wealth and honor come from You
You are the ruler of all things
In Your hands are strength and power
To exalt and give strength to all
Now, our God, we give You thanks
And praise Your glorious name

A prophet-woman broke a jar
by Love's divine appointing.
With rare perfume she filled the room,
presiding and anointing.
A prophet-woman broke a jar,
the sneers of scorn defying.
With rare perfume she filled the room,
preparing Christ for dying.
A faithful woman left a tomb
by Love's divine commission.
She saw, she heard, she preached the word,
arising from submission.
A faithful woman left a tomb
with resurrection gospel.
She saw, she heard, she preached the word,
apostle to apostles.
Though woman-wisdom, woman-truth
for centuries were hidden,
unsung, unwritten, and unheard,
derided and forbidden,
the Spirit's breath, the Spirit's fire,
on free and slave, descending,
can tumble our diving walls,
our shame and sadness mending.
The Spirit knows, the Spirit calls,
by Love's divine ordaining,
the friends we need, to serve and lead,
their powers and gifts unchaining.
The Spirit knows, the Spirit calls
from women, men, and children
the friends we need, to serve and lead.
Rejoice and make them welcome!

Praise all ye Nations
Exalt Him on High
Praise all ye Nations
Exalt Him on High
Praise all ye Nations (Him)
Exalt Him on High
Praise all ye Nations (Him)
Exalt Him on High
North and south and east and all around the world
Every nation, every people, every language praise the Lord
Lift Him up on high

A pure heart, that's what I long for.
A heart that follows hard after Thee;
A pure heart, that's what I long for.
A heart that follows hard after Thee.
VERSE:
A heart that hides Your Word
So that sin will not come in.
A heart that's undivided
But one You rule and reign;
A heart that beats compassion,
That pleases You, my Lord.
A sweet aroma of worship
That rises to Your throne.

A purple robe, a crown of thorn,
A reed in His right hand;
Before the soldiers’ spite and scorn
I see my Savior stand.
He bears between the Roman guard
The weight of all our woe;
A stumbling figure, bowed and scarred,
I see my Savior go.
He hangs, by whom the world was made,
Beneath the darkened sky;
The everlasting ransom paid,
I see my Savior die.
He shares on high His Father’s throne,
Who once in mercy came;
For all His love to sinners shown
I sing my Savior’s Name.

A rest remaineth for the weary;
Arise, sad heart, and grieve no more;
Though long the way, and dark and dreary,
It endeth on the golden shore.
Before His throne the Lamb will lead thee,
On heav’nly pastures He will feed thee,
Cast off thy burden, come with haste;
Soon will the toil and strife be ended,
The weary way which thou hast wended.
Sweet is the rest which thou shalt taste.
The Father’s house has many a dwelling,
And there will be a place for thee.
With perfect love His heart is welling
Who loved thee from eternity.
His precious blood the Lamb hath given
That thou might’st share the joys of Heaven,
And now He calleth far and near:
“Ye weary souls, cease your repining,
Come while for you My light is shining;
Come, sweetest rest awaits you here!" 
O come, come all, ye weak and weary,
Ye souls bowed down with many a care;
Arise and leave your dungeons dreary
And listen to His promise fair:
“Ye bore your burdens meek and lowly,
I will fulfill My pledge most holy,
I’ll be your solace and your rest.
Ye are Mine own, I will requite you;
Though sin and Satan seek to smite you,
Rejoice! Your home is with the blest."
There rest and peace in endless measure
Shall be ours through eternity;
No grief, no care, shall mar our pleasure,
And untold bliss our lot shall be.
Oh, had we wings to hasten yonder—
No more o’er earthly ills to ponder—
To join the glad, triumphant band!
Make haste, my soul, forget all sadness;
For peace awaits thee, joy and gladness—
The perfect rest is nigh at hand.

I have peace like a river
Flowing through my soul
Flowing through my soul
Pouring over me
I have peace like a river
Flowing through my soul
Flowing through my soul and over me
I have love.
I have joy.
I have joy (I have joy)
Flowing through me (I have joy)
I have this joy of the Lord flowing through me (I have joy)
I have this sweet (sweet, sweet)
Revelation (revelation)
Of this joy of the Lord flowing through me (I have joy)

WHILE STROLLING THROUGH THE FIELDS OF TIME
THERE'S MANY THINGS TO SEE
BUT NATURE IS THE GREATEST SIGHT
THAT COULD EVER BE
THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL
IS HOW THE WORLD WAS FORMED
AND WHY A ROSE IS THERE TO LIVE
EACH DAY AMONG THE THORNS
ONE DAY AMONG THE WORLD OF THORNS
A ROSE BEGAN TO GROW
IT WAS THE GREATEST GIFT OF GOD
THIS WORLD WILL EVER KNOW
IT WAS THE WILL OF GOD TO SHOW
THAT SINCE THE WORLD WAS FORMED
THERE HAD TO BE A ROSE TO LIVE
AND DIE AMONG THE THORNS
TWO THOUSAND YEARS HAS SINCE BEEN GONE
SINCE GOD LOOKED DOWN WITH LOVE
HE FILLED THIS EARTH WITH BEAUTY
WITH ROSES FROM ABOVE
HE HUNG UPON A RUGGED CROSS
TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM SIN
BETWEEN TWO THORNS THIS ROSE HE DIED
THREE DAYS HE BLOOMED AGAIN
ONE DAY AMONG THE WORLD OF THORNS
A ROSE BEGAN TO GROW
IT WAS THE GREATEST GIFT OF GOD
THIS WORLD WILL EVER KNOW
IT WAS THE WILL OF GOD TO SHOW
THAT SINCE THE WORLD WAS FORMED
THERE HAD TO BE A ROSE TO LIVE
AND DIE AMONG THE THORNS

A safe stronghold our God is still,
a trusty shield and weapon;
he'll keep us clear from all the ill
that hath us now o'ertaken.
The ancient prince of hell
hath risen with purpose fell;
strong mail of craft and power
he weareth in this hour;
on earth is not his fellow.
With force of arms we nothing can,
full soon were we down-ridden;
but for us fights the proper Man,
whom God himself hath bidden.
Ask ye, who is this same?
Christ Jesus is his name,
the Lord Sabaoth's Son;
he, and no other one,
shall conquer in the battle.
And were this world all devils o'er,
and watching to devour us,
we lay it not to heart so sore;
nor they can overpower us.
And let the prince of ill
look grim as e'er he will,
he harms us not a whit;
for why?--his doom is writ;
a word shall quickly slay him.
God's word, for all their craft and force,
one moment will not linger,
but, spite of hell, shall have its course;
'tis 
And though they take our life,
goods, honor, children, wife,
yet is their profit small;
these things shall vanish all:
the City of God remaineth!

A servant’s heart is what I need
To follow and obey
My pleasure is to live for You
To do just as You say
On the altar is my life
A sacrifice for You
I live and breathe each moment Lord
A willing slave for You
But Lord You know I stumble hard
I hear the voices all around
That mock and cause my heart to fear
Although You’re always near
A servant I will choose to be
Yet when I’m weak Lord strengthen me
My eyes will never look behind
I’ll cling to You for You are mine
My Master O, my Master
I’m a sacrifice for You

A love like this
No one has ever loved me like this
Nothing and no one
Can explain this feeling
A touch like this
No one has ever touched me like this
I can feel You here
So deep down in my heart
But who am I?
A simple servant, I know I am!
Touching the garment of a King
The garment of Jesus
But who am I
That You will hear my song?
If angels praise You all day long
By Your shining throne in heaven

There’s a song in my heart that my lips cannot sing,
’Tis praise in the highest to Jesus my King;
Its music each moment is thrilling my soul,
For I was a sinner, but Christ made me whole.
A sinner made whole! A sinner made whole!
The Savior has bought me and ransomed my soul!
My heart now is singing; there’s joy in my soul,
For I was a sinner, but Christ made me whole.
I shall stand one day faultless and pure by His throne,
Transformed from my image, conformed to His own;
Then I shall find words for the song of my soul,
For I was a sinner, but Christ made me whole.
All the music of Heaven, so perfect and sweet,
Will blend with my song just to make it complete,
Thro’ ages unending the echoes will roll,
For I was a sinner, but Christ made me whole.

O Jesus, O Redeemer,
With every breath, we want to exalt Thee.
O Son of God, Lord of Lords,
From our great sin, You have set us free.
God's only Son, our only hope.
Jesus will receive all of our praise.
Lamb of God, Almighty God,
We will give You the glory all of our days.
Your grace has brought me up from the deep
Your mercy, O Lord, has saved me from the flame.
I will worship you with all that have left inside me.
Your love has delivered me from myself.
Our salvation is nearer than it has ever been
Our salvation is nearer than it has ever been
My Jesus, my redeemer,
With my every breath, I will praise Your name.
My God and my Lord.
I was a sinner, but now I'll never be the same.

I was a slave to sin 
I did not even know 
Not only did He reveal the truth 
But He made me his child
()
I am unlovable
I am as dirty rags
But when He looked at me
His arms were filled with love
He gave me new life
I am so thankful
The only thing I can give to Him
Is to serve Him all my life

A slave and captive now 
was I, 
For I am dead in sin.
My life’s a waste; I’m now alone, 
Without a friend or kin.
What is this earth and sea so vast? 
What secret Will hath made? 
Whence now, poor wretch, have I come from? 
God made me, without aid.
His mighty pow’r hath made all things; 
With wisdom God abides.
Of his delights I fully know, 
God governs and he guides.

Who is this that cometh from the wilderness,
Leaning on her well-beloved’s arm,
Sweeter than the fragrant rose of Sharon,
Winning all our hearts by her charm? 
Blessed bride of Christ, we now adore thee;
Treasure of our hearts, we hymn thy praise;
Church of God, we love thee and no other;
In thy courts we’ll worship all our days.
Who is she that looketh as the morning,
Clearer than the moon’s celestial light,
Brighter than the sun’s effulgent glory,
Banishing the darkness of night? 
Who is she that standeth on the mountain,
Singing to our hearts a song of joy,
Fairer than the lilies of the valley,
Pure as gold refined from alloy? 
Who is she, the fairest of ten thousand,
Shining with the brightness of the sun,
Queen of love, and choice one of her mother?
She, my undefiled, is but one.

Sometimes I hear strange music,
Like none e’er heard before,
Come floating softly earthward
As thro’ Heav’n’s open door:
It seems like angel voices,
In strains of joy and love,
That swell the mighty 
Around the throne above.
O sweet, celestial music,
Heard from a land afar—
The song of Heav’n and Homeland,
Thro’ doors God leaves ajar!
Now soft, and low, and restful,
It floods my soul with peace,
As if God’s benediction
Bade all earth’s troubles cease.
Then, grander than the voices
Of wind, and wave, and sea—
It fills the dome of Heaven
With glorious harmony.
This music haunts me ever,
Like something heard in dreams—
It seems to catch the cadence
Of heav’nly winds and streams.
My heart is filled with rapture,
To think, some day to come,
I’ll sing it with the angels—
The song of Heav’n and home.

The wondrous work the Lord has done
Let every voice proclaim!
And for the work of grace begun,
The wondrous battle fought and won,
Give glory to His Name!
We pleaded for the Spirit,
He came in mighty power;
We pleaded for the droppings,
And lo, He sent the shower!
Unto the Lord doth praise belong,
O tell it everywhere!
Let every ransomed soul prolong
The loud hosannah of the song—
The Lord doth answer prayer!
We’ll sing the power of Jesus’ Name,
And His atoning blood;
Today and evermore the same,
The vilest sinner to reclaim,
And bring Him back to God.
Let every heart and every tongue
As one united host
Praise God for what His arm hath done—
Praise God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Holy Ghost!

A song was heard at Christmas
to wake the midnight sky:
a Savior's birth, and peace on earth,
and praise to God on high.
The angels sang at Christmas
with all the hosts above,
and still we sing the newborn King,
his glory and his love.
A star was seen at Christmas,
a herald and a sign,
that men might know the way to go
to find the child divine.
The wise men watched at Christmas
in some far eastern land,
and still the wise in starry skies
discern their Maker's hand.
A tree was grown at Christmas,
a sapling green and young:
no tinsel bright with candlelight
upon its branches hung.
But he who came at Christmas
our sins and sorrows bore,
and still we name his tree of shame
our life for evermore.
A child was born at Christmas
when Christmas first began:
the Lord of all a baby small,
for love of men made man.
For love is ours at Christmas,
and life and light restored,
and so we praise through endless days
the Savior, Christ the Lord.

I want to be a soul winner for Jesus every day;
He does so much for me;
I want to aid the lost sinner to leave his erring way,
And be from bondage free.
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
Oh let me be each day;
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
He's done so much for me.
I want to be a soul winner and bring the lost to Christ
That they His grace may know;
I want to live for Christ ever, and do His blessed will
Because He loves me so.
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
Oh let me be each day;
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),

He's done so much for me.
I want to be a soul winner till Jesus calls for me,
To lay my burdens down,
I want to hear Him say, "Servant, you've gathered many sheaves,
Receive a starry crown." 
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
Oh let me be each day;
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
A soul (winner for Jesus) winner for Jesus (Christ the Lord),
He's done so much for me.

A Spotless Rose is growing,
Sprung from a tender root,
Of ancient seers' foreshowing,
Of Jesse promised fruit;
Its fairest bud unfolds to light
Amid the cold, cold winter,
And in the dark midnight.
The Rose which I am singing,
Whereof Isaiah said,
Is from its sweet root springing
In Mary, purest Maid;
Through God's great love and might
The Blessed Babe she bare us
In a cold, cold winter's night.

I'm sure he must have been surprised at where this road had taken him
'Cause never in a million lives would he have dreamed of Bethlehem
And standing at the manger He saw with his own eyes
The message from the angel come to life and Joseph said·
Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade
Why Him, with all the rulers in the world
Why here, inside this stable filled with hay
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl
Now I'm not one to second guess what angels have to say
But this is such a strange way to save the world
To think of how it could have been, if Jesus had come as He deserved
There would have been no Bethlehem No lowly shepherds at His birth
But Joseph knew the reason Love had to reach so far
And as he held the Savior in his arms, he must have thought· 

A stranger once did bless the earth
who never caused a heart to mourn,
whose very voice gave sorrow mirth;
and how did earth his worth return?
it spurned him from its lowliest lot:
the meanest station owned him not.
An outcast thrown in sorrow's way,
a fugitive that knew no sin,
yet in lone places forced to stray;
men would not take the stranger in.
Yet peace, though much himself he mourned,
was all to others he returned.
His presence was a peace to all,
he bade the sorrowful rejoice.
Pain turned to pleasure at his call,
health lived and issued from his voice;
he healed the sick, and sent abroad
the dumb rejoicing in the Lord.
The blind met daylight in his eye,
the joys of everlasting day;
the sick found health in his reply,
the cripple threw his crutch away.
Yet he with troubles did remain,
and suffered poverty and pain.
It was for sin he suffered all
to set the world-imprisoned free,
to cheer the weary when they call;
and who could such a stranger be?
The God, who hears each human cry,
and came, a Saviour, from on high.

When we pass the golden summer,
And, like autumn leaves, retire
On the bosom of our mother,
Will our song of praise expire?
Oh, we’ll sing a sweeter anthem,
With unnumbered millions there;
Glory, honor, and salvation,
In our home so bright and fair.
If our soul is blest in singing
In this feeble house of clay,
Who can tell the bliss of reigning
In our home of endless day? 
Is it sweet to hymn the story,
Of salvation here below?
Oh, what anthems filled with glory
From the throne of God shall flow! 
Do we love our dear Redeemer,
And rejoice that we are His?
We will love and praise Him better
When we see Him as He is.
Glory, glory be to Jesus!
Let us shout with joyful praise
To the Rock of our salvation
All this life and endless days.

I’ll tell you a tale of the olden time,
While the yule log burns bright, and the church bells chime.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
There sate a fair princess in joy on her throne,
And there in her arms her Infant was shown:
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
The beasts of the meadows bowed down their head
All under the moonlight so softly shed.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
They worshipped the King of Creation there
In the arms of the mother so passing fair.
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
O who are these masters of ancient mould?
O these are the shepherds, the lords of the fold;
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
They have heard from the sky of the birth of their King,
They have heard all the sky with the harmony ring.
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
The kings of the east in number three,
All worship the Monarch of high degree;
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Their tribute they offer, their heads they bow,
And clearer and clearer is echoing now,
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
For all the zenith is blazing with light,
And musical voices enrapture the night:
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
O this is the carol of peace and goodwill
From the voices celestial, the zenith that fill;
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

We light a thousand candles bright, around the earth today,
And all the beams will shine across the heaven's grand display.
Yes, over land and sea tonight the joyful message brings
The birth of Him, our Lord and Christ, our Savior and our King.
Dear brightest star o'er Bethlehem, O let your precious light
Shine in with hope and peace toward men in ev'ry home tonight.
In all our house so cold and dark, please send your warmth sublime,
The warmth that comes from Jesus' love this blessed Christmas time.

Wonderful Counselor,
King of Incense and Myrrh, 
Eternal Father,
(and)Sin's Lone Forsaker,
Prince of Glorious Peace,
Comforter of No Decrease,
Season of no comply
Reason for my every why
You're the God of a thousand names
For none can fully proclaim
All You've done for me…
All You've done for me…
Maker, the Lord Most High,
Painter of the Sunset Sky
Loving Befriender,
Watching Defender,
Shadow at noontime sun
Morning star when the light is gone
Mover of Mountains
Spring of all Fountains

A thousand years have come and gone, and near a thousand more,
Since happier light from heaven shone than ever shone before:
And in the hearts of old and young a joy most joyful stirred.
That sent such news from tongue to tongue as ears had never heard.
Then angels on their starry way felt bliss unfelt before,
For news that men should be as they to darkened earth they bore;
So toiling men and spirits bright a first communion had,
And in meek mercy’s rising light were each exceeding glad.
And we are glad, and we will sing, as in the days of yore;
Come all, and hearts made ready bring, to welcome back once more
The day when first on wintry earth a summer change began,
And, dawning in a lowly birth uprose the Light of man.
For trouble such as men must bear from childhood to fourscore,
He shared with us, that we might share His joy forevermore;
And twice a thousand years of grief of conflict, and of sin,
May tell how large the harvest sheaf His patient love shall win.

A promise spoken in the beginning
A prophet's words in the night
An angel's message to a young lady
A brilliant star in the sky 
Who would be coming?
How were they knowing?
What's it all about?
Why was He coming?
Where was He going?
When will they all find out?
A tiny child (tiny child)!
Almighty God (mighty God)!
A tiny child!
An almighty God! 
A lonely village, a lowly carpenter
No proper shelter in sight
Their room a stable, manger a cradle
Angelic hosts on high 
A little baby boy, the hope of peace and joy
A tiny beacon of light
Divine creator becomes creation
His holy promise of life 
(interlude) 
He came to people (the Son of man), born of the people (became a man)
So that the people could be free (so that we could see)
He lived with people (He blessed their lives), He blessed the people (He broke 
through time)
The people nailed Him to a tree (they crucified Him) 
A tiny child (a tiny little child)!
Almighty God (an awesome, an almighty God, tiny little baby)!
A tiny child!
An almighty God (almighty)!
A tiny child (a tiny child)!
Almighty God (an awesome, an almighty God)!
A tiny child (almighty God)!
Almighty, almighty God 

Ain't there trouble around us? (yes, there's trouble around)
Oh yes there's trouble around us (yes, there's trouble around)
And ain't there hatred about us? (yes, there's hatred about)
You know there's hatred about us (you know, there's hatred about) 
But don't you know that it's a very special time to be living in this world
It's a very special hour to be alive
'Cause my Jesus Christ gave in to the cross of Calvary
And He's reigning now, it's so great to be alive 
Ain't there confusion about us? (yes, confusion's about)
Yes there's confusion about us (there's confusion about)
And ain't there temptation around us? (yes, temptation's about)
You know there's temptation around us (you know, temptation's around) 
But let me tell you it's a very special time to be living in this world
It's a very special hour to be alive
'Cause my Jesus Christ gives me hope and the strength with which to cope
With the world so bad, it's so great to be alive 
It's so great to be alive!
It's so wonderful to understand
That no matter where the world goes
My destiny is in His hands 
But ain't our world now in trouble? (it's in trouble our world)
You know our world is in trouble (it's in trouble our world)
And don't the world need a Savior (needs a Savior our world)
We need to show them the Savior (needs a Savior our world) 
But don't you know that it's a very special time to be living in this world
It's a very special hour to be alive
'Cause my Jesus won't forget that He promised to return
And He's coming soon, it's so great to be alive! 
Yes He's coming soon, it's so great to be alive! 

A Virgin most pure, as the prophets do tell,
Hath brought forth a baby, as it hath befell,
To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,
Which Adam's transgression hath wrapped us in:
Aye and therefore be merry,
rejoice and be you merry,
Set sorrows aside;
Christ Jesus our Saviour
was born on this tide.
At Bethlem in Jewry a city there was,
Where Joseph and Mary together did pass,
And there to be taxed with many one mo',
For Caesar commanded the same should be so:
But when they had entered the city so fair,
A number of people so mighty was there,
That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,
Could find in the inn there no lodging at all:
Then they were constrained in a stable to lie,
Where horses and asses they used for to tie;
Their lodging so simple the took it no scorn,
But against the next morning our Saviour was born:
The King of all kings to this world being brought,
Small store of fine linen to wrap him was sought;
And when she had swaddled her young son so sweet,
Within an ox-manger she laid him to sleep:
Then God sent an angel from heaven so high,
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,
And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,
Because that our Saviour was born on this day:
Then presently after the shepherds did spy
A number of angels that stood in the sky;
They joyfully talked, and sweetly did sing,
To God be all glory, our heavenly King:

I hear a voice callin'
it must be our Lord (it must be our Lord)
Its coming from heaven on high.
I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward ( I've gained a reward)
for the land where we never shall die.
The saviour who di.ed, on cruel calvary
he shed his life blood that the world might be free.
So follow his footsteps, up the narrow way.
and be ready to meet him when calls on that day.
(to )
The saviour has paid a great price for me
He gave his life on calvary.
so follow his footsteps,up the narrow way.
that'll pay my debt on the great judgement day.

Jesus loves me this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are week, but He is strong
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so
In the quiet of the hour
A small voice dares to be heard
And though the voice is soft, the tones are hushed
You know the King of kings is stirred
A voice of praise will be the song we raise
A voice of praise to our King
A voice of praise lives on eternally
So let the heavens ring with a voice of praise
So hush, the angels listen in
As voices start to blend in love
For as the grows, the praises swell
And spirits soar to heaven above
La (la), la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la, la la
For the joy to know He listens now
As praises to His feet now fly
Angel wings, they beat the time
As all creation starts to sing
A voice of praise, a voice of praise, a voice of praise (praise, praise, praise, 
praise)

A wedding took place in the village of Cana,
And Jesus, His mother, and followers all came.
The wine was exhausted, and Mary informed Him,
“They have no more wine"—this would surely bring shame.
“Dear woman," He answered, “why do you involve Me?
My time to be recognized has not yet come."
His mother then said to the servants there waiting,
“Whatever He tells you, now let it be done."
Six water jars stood there for ritual washing,
Each holding then full twenty gallons or more.
He said to the servants, “Now fill them with water."
They filled them brimful; there was no room for more.
Then Jesus instructed, “Take some to the master."
The water had turned into wine—none knew how.
On tasting, the master exclaimed in amazement,
“The choicest and best wine you’ve saved until now!"
When Jesus turned water to wine there in Cana,
This was the first miracle He’d ever done.
His glory He thus did reveal to the people,
And as a result, His disciples were won.
Lord, may I be like them, believing You fully.
And like the stone water jars, may I e’er be,
Filled up to the brim with Your transforming Spirit.
Reveal now Your glory to others through me.

I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no (tell us no)
Or where to go (where to go)
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here (way up here)
It's crystal clear (crystal clear)
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feelings
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star (shooting star)
I've come so far (come so far)

Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world (every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (wvery moment red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere (whole new world)
There's time to spare
Anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you (whole new world)
A whole new world (a whole new world)
That's where we'll be (that's where we will be)
A thrilling place
A wondrous place
For you and me (I can show you the world) 

A wife of noble 
character, 
Is guerdon from the hand of God.
She works all day with eager hands, 
Invests herself in every job.
She is not proud but full of love 
And helps the hungry and the weak.
Her husband has full faith in her; 
Of her, her children highly speak.
She speaks with wisdom, faith, and love, 
And faithfulness receives reward 
The gilt of beauty fades away, 
But praised is she who fears the Lord.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.

A world of evil, whole course on fire!
On fire
On fire
A small spark, course on fire
On fire
A small spark, course on fire
So many animals, birds of the air, and the fish in the sea
We have been able to bring them all under control
Out of the mouth we hear praising and cursing, and this shouldn't be
Funny we're not as successful in guiding our souls
Though it's small, the tongue has power, more than you know
Like a rudder pilots where you go
We submit to restless evil, full knowing well
It's poisonous and set on fire by hell
Though it's a spark (a small spark)
Sets it on fire (course on fire)
Though it's a spark (a small spark)
Sets it on fire (course on fire)
Speaking before we are thinking, so careless with all that we say
Making remarks when we fail to consider the reason
We often react without knowin' the facts, and our tongues won't obey
Bein' corrupted with words that are full of the poison
Knowing better we should be not be down in the mire
Course directed by the burning fire
Since the time we learn to talk, we're never the same
Full of power that we cannot tame (tame)
Though it's a spark (a small spark) (a world of evil)
Sets it on fire (course on fire) (whole course on fire)
Though it's a spark (a small spark) (a world of evil)
Sets it on fire (course on fire) (whole course on fire)
Don't be feelin' helpless (helpless), strugglin' all alone (all alone)
He will help us overcome this sin (sin, sin)
Now you should remember (remember) you are not your own (not your own)
Claim a victory through our precious Friend
Through our precious Friend
A small spark
Course on fire
A world of evil (A small spark)
Whole course on fire (Course on fire)
Though it's a spark (A small spark) (A world of evil)
Sets it on fire (Course on fire) (Whole course on fire)

I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord:
This was freely given, and I found
That He always kept His word.
There’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
And the white robed angels sing the story,
“A sinner has come home."
For there’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,
Never more to roam.
I was humbly kneeling at the cross,
Fearing naught by God’s angry frown;
When the heavens opened and I saw
That my name was written down.
There’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
And the white robed angels sing the story,
“A sinner has come home."
For there’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,
Never more to roam.
In the Book ’tis written, “Saved by Grace,"
O the joy that came to my soul!
Now I am forgiven, and I know
By the blood I am made whole.
There’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
And the white robed angels sing the story,
“A sinner has come home."
For there’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,
Never more to roam.

I'm feeling like the eagle that rises
Flies above the earth and it's troubles
Oh yes it knows that there are valleys below
But under his wings there's a stronger power
Oh Father-You are my strength
On you I wait upon
You make the road rise up to meet me
You make the sunshine warm upon my face
The wind is at my back & the rain falls soft
God I lift you high-You are my Abba
Running in this race to the finish line
The only road for me is the narrow
Not gonna stop or even look to the side
When I fix my eyes upon You Jesus
Oh Father (Abba)-You are my strength 
Now more than ever
REPEAT
When you've run too far-and the road is long
Can't walk another mile-He is waiting
Hope in Him again-He'll renew you
Then you will rise, gather up your wings and fly.

In Jesus we come to You.
In our hearts Your Spirit moves.
We Your little children
Come in adoration.
Abba Father (Abba Father)
Draw me nearer
(draw me nearer)
Hold me closer (hold me closer)
Abba Father (Abba Father)
Abba Father (Abba Father)
Draw me nearer
(draw me nearer)
Hold me closer (hold me closer)
Abba Father (Abba Father)
Just sitting here at your feet,
Quite contented just to be
Resting in your presence,
Safe, secure, protected.
()

“Abba, Father!" We approach Thee
In our Savior’s precious Name;
We, Thy children, here assembled,
Now Thy promised blessing claim;
From our sins His blood hath washed us,
’Tis through Him our souls draw nigh,
And Thy Spirit, too, hath taught us,
“Abba, Father," thus to cry.
Once as prodigals we wandered
In our folly far from Thee,
But Thy grace, o’er sin abounding,
Rescued us from misery;
Thou Thy prodigals hast pardoned,
Kissed us with a Father’s love,
Spread the festive board, and called us,
E’er to dwell with Thee above.
Clothed in garments of salvation,
At Thy table is our place,
We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest,
In the riches of Thy grace;
“It is meet," we hear Thee saying,
“We should merry and be glad,
I have found My once lost children,
Now they live who once were dead."
“Abba, Father!" all adore Thee,
All rejoice in Heav’n above,
While in us they learn the wonders
Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love;
Soon before Thy throne assembled,
All Thy children shall proclaim,
“Glory, everlasting glory,
Be to God and to the Lamb!"

O Abba, Father, Lord of 
Life, 
What choice can curb your will? 
Though men may plot their sep’rate course, 
Each step obeys you still.
O Mighty God and Upright Judge, 
Who keeps their death at bay? 
Men whitewash tombs and flee in vain 
Your throne and judgment day.
O Wondrous King of majesty 
Who sees your holy place? 
The west would fold upon the east 
To glimpse your shining face.
O Couns’lor, Christ; Love sacrificed, 
My joy, my goal, my aim, 
What flesh or foil can claim or spoil 
Your holy, righteous name.

Abba O Abba Father
You are the potter
And we are the clay,
The work of your hands
Mould us mould us and 
Fashion us, 
Into the image,
Of Jesus your Son
Of Jesus your Son.
Father, may we be one in you,
May we be one in you,
As he is in you,
And you are in him
Glory, glory and praise to thee
Glory and praise to thee
Forever amen.
Forever amen.
Forever amen.

Abide in me, O Lord, and I in Thee,
From this good hour, oh, leave me nevermore;
Then shall the discord cease, the wound be healed,
The lifelong bleeding of the soul be o’er.
Abide in me; o’ershadow by Thy love
Each half formed purpose and dark thought of sin;
Quench ere it rise each selfish, low desire,
And keep my soul as Thine, calm and divine.
As some rare perfume in a vase of clay,
Pervades it with a fragrance not its own,
So, when Thou dwellest in a mortal soul,
All Heaven’s own sweetness seems around it thrown.
Abide in me; there have been moments blest
When I have heard Thy voice and felt Thy power;
Then evil lost its grasp; and passion, hushed,
Owned the divine enchantment of the hour.
These were but seasons beautiful and rare;
Abide in me, and they shall ever be;
Fulfill at once Thy precept and my prayer,
Come, and abide in me, and I in Thee.

Abide in Thee, in that deep love of Thine,
My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine;
Down, closely down, as living branch with tree,
I would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee.
Abide in Thee, my Savior, God, I know
How love of Thine, so vast, in me may flow:
My empty vessel running o’er with joy,
Now overflows to Thee without alloy.
Abide in Thee, nor doubt, nor self, nor sin,
Can e’er prevail with Thy blest life within;
Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul
Knows naught besides its motions to control.
Abide in Thee, ’tis thus alone I know
The secrets of Thy mind e’en while below;
All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy Word,
All power and fruit, and service for the Lord.

Abide not in the realm of dreams,
O man, however fair it seems;
But with clear eye the present scan,
And hear the call of God and man.
Think not in sleep to fold thy hands,
Forgetful of thy Lord’s commands;
From duty’s claims no life is free,
Behold, today hath need of thee.
The present hour allots thy task,
For present strength and patience ask;
And trust His love Whose sure supply
Meets all thy need abundantly.

Abide, O dearest Jesus,
Among us with Thy grace,
That Satan may not harm us,
Nor we to sin give place.
Abide, O dear Redeemer,
Among us with Thy Word,
And thus now and hereafter
True peace and joy afford.
Abide with heav’nly brightness
Among us, precious Light;
Thy truth direct, and keep us
From error’s gloomy night.
Abide with richest blessings
Among us, bounteous Lord;
Let us in grace and wisdom
Grow daily through Thy Word.
Abide with Thy protection
Among us, Lord, our Strength,
Lest world and Satan fell us
And overcome at length.
Abide, O faithful Savior,
Among us with Thy love;
Grant steadfastness, and help us
To reach our home above.

Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
The day is past and gone;
The shadows of the evening fall;
The night is coming on!
Within my heart a welcome Guest,
Within my home abide.
O Savior, stay this night with me;
Behold, ’tis eventide!
O Savior, stay this night with me;
Behold, ’tis eventide!
Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
Thy walk today with me
Has made my heart within me burn,
As I communed with Thee.
Thy earnest words have filled my soul
And kept me near Thy side.
Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
And lone will be the night,
If I cannot commune with Thee,
Nor find in Thee my light.
The darkness of the world, I fear,
Would in my home abide.

Abide with us, our Savior,
Nor let Thy mercy cease;
From Satan’s might defend us,
And grant our souls release.
Abide with us, our Savior,
Sustain us by Thy Word,
That we may, now and ever,
Find peace in Thee, O Lord.
Abide with us, our Savior,
Thou Light of endless Light;
Increase to us Thy blessings,
And save us by Thy might.

“Abide with us, the day is waning,"
Thus prayed the two while on the way;
We read that Thou, O Lord, remaining,
Didst all their doubts and fears allay.
Incline Thine ear, Thou King of Grace,
When, praying thus, we seek Thy face.
At eventide, Thy Spirit sending,
Help us, O Lord, our watch to keep,
In prayer devout before Thee bending,
Ere we our eyelids close in sleep,
Confessing sin in deed and word
With hope of mercy from the Lord.
Abide with us; with heav’nly gladness
Illumine, Lord, our darkest day;
And when we weep in pain and sadness,
Be Thou our Solace, Strength and Stay.
Tell of Thy woe, Thy victory won,
When Thou didst pray: “Thy will be done."
Abide with us, O Savior tender,
That bitter day when life shall end,
When to the grave we must surrender,
And fear and pain our hearts shall rend.
The shield of faith do Thou bestow
When trembling we must meet the foe.
When earthly help no more availeth,
To sup with us Thou wilt be nigh;
Thou givest strength that never faileth,
In Thee we grave and death defy.
While earth is fading from our sight,
Our eyes behold the realms of light.

Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
The day is past and gone;
The shadows of the evening fall;
The night is coming on!
Within my heart a welcome Guest,
Within my home abide.
O Savior, stay this night with me;
Behold, ’tis eventide!
O Savior, stay this night with me;
Behold, ’tis eventide!
Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
Thy walk today with me
Has made my heart within me burn,
As I communed with Thee.
Thy earnest words have filled my soul
And kept me near Thy side.
Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
And lone will be the night,
If I cannot commune with Thee,
Nor find in Thee my light.
The darkness of the world, I fear,
Would in my home abide.

O troubled heart, be thou not afraid,
In the Lord thy God, let thy hope be stayed;
He will hear thy cry and will give thee aid,
Whate’er thy cross may be.
He is able still to deliver thee,
And His own right hand thy defense shall be:
He is able still to deliver thee,
Then be thou not afraid.
O troubled heart, tho’ thy foes unite,
Let thy faith be strong and thy armor bright;
Thou shalt overcome thro’ His pow’r and might,
And more than conqu’ror be.
O troubled heart, when thy way is drear,
He will rescue thee and dispel thy fear;
In thy greatest need He is always near,
To Him all glory be.

Jesus, my Lord, my life, my all,
In Thee I trust, in Thee I hide;
I know Thou wilt not let me fall
If I stay by Thy side.
In Thy dear hands of love I lay,
Fulfill Thy purposes in me;
Teach me to say from day to day,
Thy will be done in me.
The storms of life are fierce and dark,
And hosts of Satan press me hard;
But still Thy strength can keep my bark,
Though broken and sin-marred.
Though hard the cross, the burden great,
And I so weak, so poor, undone;
Yet on Thy side I’ll stand and wait,
Till victory is won.
The battle, Lord, is Thine, and we,
Though foe may kill us; yet I see
Thy blood sets poor dead captives free,
Though fierce the war may be.

Look to Jesus on the tree,
He is able to save you;
Dying there for you and me,
He is willing to save you.
Able to save a poor sinner lost,
Willing to save at a fearful cost;
Able to save: Come, trust in His pow’r;
Willing to save this very hour.
O His love will melt your heart,
He is able to save you;
If from sin you will depart,
He is willing to save you.
Do not let Him plead in vain,
He is able to save you.
Let His blood wash every stain,
He is willing to save you.
Let Him enter now your heart,
He is able to save you;
If you wait He will depart,
Now He’s waiting to save you.

Abode of peace, my Father’s home forever!
My weary soul in faith doth yearn for thee.
I homeward look to Thee, my Lord and Savior,
To Thine abode of peace, eternally.
There is on earth no peaceful rest;
Our faith is weak, our souls oppressed,
Our vision dim and failing,
Our vision dim and failing.
The Lord be praised that time so swiftly flieth;
God’s promise is fulfilled forevermore.
Who on God’s Word and promises relieth
Shall find at last the choicest wine in store.
Forgotten then is all distress,
Eternal peace and happiness
Shall then be ours forever,
Shall then be ours forever.
Then, keep my heart forever, O my Savior,
And let me never, Lord, from Thee depart.
In joy, in pain, in sorrow, now and ever,
Thou only givest solace to my heart.
For when, O Lord, I am with Thee,
All other comforts well may flee;
With Thee I’m blest forever,
With Thee I’m blest forever.

Above all powers above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began
Above all kingdoms above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure what You're worth
Crucified laid behind the stone
You lived to die rejected and alone
Like a Rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me
Above all

Jesus my passion in life is to know you
May all other goals bow down to
This journey to loving you more
Jesus you've showered your goodness on me
Given your gifts so freely
But there's one thing I'm longing for
Hear my heart's cry
And my prayer for this life
Above all else, above all else
Above all else, give me yourself

Lord, your glory fills my heart
Your presence deep within me stirs my soul
Oh Lord, how awesome are your ways
Your majesty surrounding all the Earth.
Lord, your Spirit moves me now
And I see a picture of your holiness
Oh Lord, I look into your eyes
and feel a fire burn into my heart.
All wisdom and honor and glory forever.
All power and greatness and splendor
They are yours above all others, my Lord.

Above all the roar of the cities,
And over the hills and the dells,
With a message of peace to the nations,
Ring the beautiful Bethlehem bells,
Bringing joy to the souls that are sighing
In hovels where poverty dwells—
There is life, there is life for the dying
In the beautiful Bethlehem bells.
Beautiful Bethlehem bells;
Beautiful bells, beautiful bells,
Beautiful Bethlehem bells.
Far off in a land that is lovely,
For the tender, sweet story it tells,
In the light of a glorious morning,
Rang the beautiful Bethlehem bells;
And still in the hearts of creation
An anthem exultingly swells
At that memory sweet of the ringing
Of the beautiful Bethlehem bells.
They rang o’er the hills and the valleys,
They summoned the glad world that day,
From the regions of night to the manger,
Where the beautiful Child Jesus lay;
And forever and ever and ever
A wonderful melody dwells
In the tender, sweet ringing and singing
Of the beautiful Bethlehem bells.

There's a Friend for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
A Friend who never changes
Whose love will never die;
Our earthly friends may fail us,
And change with changing years,
This Friend is always worthy
Of that dear name he bears.
There's a home for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
Where Jesus reigns in glory,
A home of peace and joy;
No home on earth is like it,
Nor can with it compare;
And everyone is happy,
Nor could be happier there.

There's a beautiful place called heaven
It is hidden above the bright blue
Where the good who from earth ties are riven
Life in love an eternity through
Above the bright blue, the beautiful blue
Jesus is waiting for me and for you
Heaven is there, not far from our sight
Beautiful city of light
We know not when He shall call us
Whether soon the glad summons shall be
But we know when we pass o'er the river
The glory of Jesus we'll see

Above the clear blue sky,
In Heaven’s bright abode,
The angel host on high
Sing praises to their God;
Alleluia! They love to sing
Alleluia! They love to sing
To God their King Alleluia!
O blessed Lord, Thy truth
To all Thy flock impart,
And teach us in our youth
To know Thee as Thou art.
Alleluia! Then shall we sing
Alleluia! Then shall we sing
To God our King Alleluia!
O, may Thy holy Word
Spread all the world around!
And all with one accord
Uplift the joyful sound:
Alleluia! All then shall sing
Alleluia! All then shall sing
To God their King Alleluia!

Above the hills of time the cross is gleaming,
Fair as the sun when night has turned to day;
And from it love’s pure light is richly streaming,
To cleanse the heart and banish sin away.
To this dear cross the eyes of men are turning,
Today as in the ages lost to sight;
And for Thee, O Christ, men’s hearts are yearning,
As shipwrecked seamen yearn for morning light.
The cross, O Christ, Thy wondrous love revealing,
Awakes our hearts as with the light of morn,
And pardon o’er our sinful spirits stealing,
Tells us that we, in Thee, have been reborn.
Like echoes to sweet temple bells replying
Our hearts, O Lord, make answer to Thy love;
And we will love Thee with a love undying,
Till we are gathered to Thy home above.

Above the starry spheres,
To where He was before,
Christ had gone up, the Father’s gift
Upon the Church to pour.
At length had fully come,
On mystic circle borne
Of seven times seven revolving days,
The Pentecostal morn.
When, as the Apostles knelt
At the third hour in prayer,
A sudden rushing sound proclaimed
That God Himself was there.
Forthwith a tongue of fire
Is seen on every brow,
Each heart receives the Father’s light,
The Word’s enkindling glow.
The Holy Ghost on all
Is mightily outpoured,
Who straight in divers tongues declare
The wonders of the Lord.
While strangers of all climes
Flock round from far and near,
And their own tongue, wherever born,
All with amazement hear.
But Judah, faithless still,
Denies the hand divine;
And, mocking, jeers the saints of Christ
As full of new made wine.
Till Peter, in the midst,
By Joel’s ancient word,
Rebukes their unbelief, and wins
Three thousand to the Lord.
The Father and the Son
And Spirit we adore,
O may the Spirit’s gifts be poured
On us forevermore.

Above the trembling elements,
Above life’s restless sea,
Dear Savior, lift my spirit up,
O lift me up to Thee!
Great calmness there, sweet patience, too,
Upon Thy face I see;
I would be calm and patient, Lord,
O lift me up to Thee!
I am not weary of Thy work,
From earth I would not flee;
But while I walk and while I serve,
O lift me up to Thee!
That I may bless my tender friends,
And those who love not me;
But while I walk and while I serve,
O lift me up to Thee!
Whatever falls of good or ill,
Thy hand, Thy care I see,
And while these varied dealings pass,
O lift me up to Thee!
And when my eyes close for the last,
Still this my prayer shall be:
Dear Savior, lift my spirit up,
And lift me up to Thee!

Above thine own ambitions here
Another voice is sounding clear;
It is the call of God to thee:
O leave thy all, and follow Me!
Go thro' with God, thy vows to pay,
Thy life upon the altar lay;
The Holy Ghost will do the rest,
And bring to thee God's very best!
The call of God, it is so clear,
But friendships call, and home is dear;
Ah, lonely was the path He trod,
Then wilt thou not go on with God?
So soon eternal morn shall dawn,
How fast the night is hast'ning on;
So soon His lovely face to see,
How sad to empty-handed be!
The price is high, severe the test
For those who would enjoy God's best;
Surrender all, then take the road
With those who will go thro' with God.

Above yon clear blue sky,
Beyond our feeble sight,
The God of glory dwells on high
In everlasting light.
Around His glorious throne
The holy angels stand;
In songs of praise their King they own,
Or fly at His command.
And we may praise Him, too,
And serve Him here below;
He stoops to mark what children do,
Their inmost thoughts to know;
And though He reigns above,
Where angels ceaseless praise,
He will accept our humble love,
And lead us in His ways.
O may we humbly seek
To do His holy will,
And try, with thankful hearts and meek,
To sing His praises still;
And then for Jesus’ sake,
Who came for us to die,
Our happy spirits He will take
To praise Him in the sky.

The Lord woke Abraham 
one night, 
And told the man to take 
The promised Isaac his one son, 
To kill for God’s great sake.
Then Abraham his son did take; 
The boy was unaware, 
He calmly walked the mountain steep; 
His son did not despair.
But as he raised the deadly knife 
His only son to slay, 
“Don’t kill the boy!" The Lord called down 
In bright and shining ray.
Christ Jesus offered up himself 
Like Isaac Abr’ms son; 
And shining forth he rose again, 
And conquered all our sins.

Absent from flesh! O blissful thought!
What unknown joys this moment brings!
Freed from the mischiefs sin has brought,
From pains, and fears, and all their springs.
Absent from flesh! illustrious day!
Surprising scene! triumphant stroke
That rends the prison of my clay;
And I can feel my fetters broke.
Absent from flesh! then rise, my soul,
Where feet nor wings could never climb,
Beyond the heav’ns, where planets roll,
Measuring the cares and joys of time.
I go where God and glory shine,
His presence makes eternal day:
My all that’s mortal I resign,
For angels wait and point my way.

Under the burdens of guilt and care
Many a spirit is grieving,
Who in the joy of the Lord might share,
Life everlasting receiving.
Life, life, eternal life!
Jesus alone is the giver;
Life, life, abundant life!
Glory to Jesus forever!
Bearing our burden of guilt,
there came One who is strong to deliver;
Bringing to men, through His wondrous name,
Life "more abundant" than ever.
Burdened one, why will you longer bear
Sorrows from which He releases?
Open your heart and, rejoicing,
share Life "more abundant" in Jesus!
Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows,
Flooding the vale with a river;
So, from the hill of the cross there flows
Life "more abundant" for ever.
O for the floods on the thirsty land!
O for a mighty revival!
O for a sanctified, fearless band,
Ready to hail its arrival!

When you are going to judge
You need to take a second look
Not at your brother's speck
But the warning that's in The Book
'Cause who alone can judge
Except the One who knows our mind?
He knows the inner man
And difficulties we may find 
So often we condemn (Condemn)
And our minds are never in gear (Minds are never in gear)
Our feelings then are led (Are led)
By suspicious, crippling fear (Suspicious, crippling)
To love our brothers now (Now)
We've got to use our Master's eyes (Eyes)
So we will not condemn
The result will be a surprise when we.
Accept one another without judging your brother
The Lord has been good to you
Accept one another without judging your brother
It's the Godly thing you ought to do
Accept one another without judging your brother
There's no need to cause a fight
Accept one another without judging your brother
It's the Godly way of living right 
What do you want yourself (What do you want?)
When it comes right down to a choice?
Is judgement what you want (What you want)
Or a kind and merciful voice (Merciful voice)
To tell you that they care
And are overlooking the bad?
They know your faults so well
But are accepting you instead 
And now we leave with your choice
Won't you tell me what'll you do? (What'll you do?)
The measures that you use
Is the measure that's used for you
So when you're prone to judge
Won't you think of this simple song
Before you make mistakes
By judging and treating them wrong, instead.
When you think of what He's done
Givin' up His only son
Livin' in a world of hate
How can you retaliate?
Knowing what he's done for me
Following His legacy
I'm gonna rise above
Accepting those that He has loved 
It's the Godly way of living right
It's the Godly way of living right 

As I come, O Savior, pleading
That my soul thou shouldst restore,
All I have I now am bringing,
Thine to be forevermore.
Thou hast said Thou wouldst receive me,
Nor my earnest plea deny;
Now I know I am accepted,
On Thy promise I rely.
I have done what Thou hast taught me,
From the world have turned aside;
Let me be a holy temple,
Where Thy presence may abide.
I am hoping in Thy mercy,
Not in that which I can do;
And I know Thou failest never,
To my soul Thou wilt be true.
Not a thing am I withholding,
All is on the altar laid;
Now I claim Thy promise boldly,
And no longer am afraid.

“In the Beloved" accepted am I,
Risen, ascended, and seated on high;
Saved from all sin thro’ His infinite grace,
With the redeemed ones accorded a place.
“In the Beloved," God’s marvelous grace
Calls me to dwell in this wonderful place;
God sees my Savior, and then He sees me,
“In the Beloved," accepted and free.
“In the Beloved"— how safe my retreat,
In the Beloved accounted complete;
“Who can condemn me?" In Him I am free,
Savior and Keeper forever is He.
“In the Beloved" I went to the tree,
There, in His Person, by faith I may see
Infinite wrath rolling over His head,
Infinite grace, for He died in my stead.

According to thy gracious word,
in meek humility,
this will I do, my dying Lord,
I will remember thee.
Thy body, broken for my sake,
my bread from heaven shall be;
thy testamental cup I take,
and thus remember thee.
Gethsemane can I forget?
Or there thy conflict see,
thine agony and bloody sweat,
and not remember thee?
When to the cross I turn mine eyes
and rest on Calvary;
O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,
I must remember thee.
Remember thee, and all thy pains,
and all thy love to me;
yea, while I have a breath, a pulse remains,
will I remember thee.
And when these failing lips grow dumb,
and mind and memory flee,
when thou shalt in thy kingdom come,
Jesus, remember me.

I had lived a life of sin in this world were living in
I had done forbidden things I shouldn't do
I met a beggar along the way, and I asked him where to stay
Where I'd find real happiness and love that's true
Just follow footsteps of the King and you'll hear the voices sing
They'll be singing out the glory of the Lamb
The river of Jordan will be near, the sound of trumpets you will hear
You'll behold the sweetest voice ever known to man
Many in this worldly throng traveling in the paths of wrong
Never stop to pray and find the Savior true
There's a grand and glorious place where we'll meet Him face to face
In a happy land beyond the starry blue
Across the bridge, there's no more sorrow
Across the bridge, theres' no more pain
The Son will shine across the river
And you'll never be unhappy again

All around this world I've traveled
Through it all I've come to find
The ties that bind can come unraveled
I've had to face some lonely times
But when I'm tired and feeling low
Oh what a comfort it is to know 
Across the miles there's someone praying for me
Across the miles there's someone on their knees
Lifting my name to the Lord above
In joy and pain I can feel the love
And see you smile
Across the miles 
Life can be so complicated
Walking through it on your own
When kindred hearts are separated
It gives love a chance to grow
And even though I'm so far away
Oh I'm reminded every day 
Across the miles there's someone praying for me
Across the miles there's someone on their knees
Lifting my name to the Lord above
In joy and pain I can feel the love
And see you smile
Across the miles
Across the miles
Across the miles 

Across the sky the shades of night
This New Year’s Eve are fleeting,
We deck Thine altar, Lord, with light,
In solemn worship meeting;
And as the year’s last hours go by,
We raise to Thee our earnest cry,
Once more Thy love entreating.
Before the cross subdued we bow,
To Thee our prayers addressing,
Recounting all Thy mercies now,
And all our sins confessing;
Beseeching Thee this coming year
To keep us in Thy faith and fear
And crown us with Thy blessing.
And while we pray, we lift our eyes
To dear ones gone before us,
Safe home with thee in paradise,
Whose peace descendeth o’er us;
And beg of Thee, when life is past,
To reunite us all at last
With those who’ve gone before us.
We gather up in this brief hour
The memory of Thy mercies;
Thy wondrous goodness, love and power
Our grateful song rehearses;
For Thou hast been our Strength and Stay
In many a dark and dreary day
Of sorrow and reverses.
In many an hour when fear and dread,
Like evil spells, have bound us
And clouds were gathering overhead,
Thy providence hath found us.
In many a night when seas ran high,
Thy gracious presence, drawing nigh,
Hath made all calm around us.
Then, O great God, in years to come,
Whatever may betide us,
Right onward through our journey home
Be Thou at hand to guide us;
Nor leave us till at close of life,
Safe from all perils, toil, and strife,
Heaven shall enfold and hide us.

It was an act of God
This old world was not an accident
It came to be by the touch of His hand
Through His love He formed creation
Then reached out and breathed His life into man
Yes for all of us
He is calling us with His blessings to show
The best part of it is the heart of it
It's the good news we know
Every time the sun shows His face
Every time I've needed His grace
Every little bird in the air
Never will escape from His care
He arose again He defeated sin
And He shed His blood for me
It was an act of God
Now we hear such strange philosophies
From those who teach - we expect them to know
But they push God out of the picture
When His presence is quite obvious 
Only fools deny Him so
And in all of us there's a call in us
For the truth to be shown
Yes the heart of it - every part of it
Is from God's highest throne
(I've got to know.)
Was it an act of God - causing you to turn Him away? 
Is it an act of God - that you're refusing to pray?
It was an act of God - opening the blind eyes to see
It is an act of God - what He is doing for me
I know
He arose again He defeated sin
And he's coming back for me 
It is an act of God
Oh it, it is an act of God 

Adam, our father and our head,
Transgressed, and justice doomed us dead;
The fiery law speaks all despair:
There’s no reprieve nor pardon there.
But, O unutterable grace!
The Son of God takes Adam’s place;
Down to our world the Savior flies,
Stretches His arms, and bleeds, and dies.
Justice was pleased to bruise the God,
And pay its wrongs with heav’nly blood:
What unknown racks and pangs He bore!
Then rose; the law could ask no more.
Amazing work! look down, ye skies,
Wonder and gaze with all your eyes;
Ye heav’nly thrones, stoop from above,
And bow to this mysterious love.
Lo! they adore th’incarnate Son,
And sing the glories He hath won;
Sing how He broke our iron chains,
How deep He sunk, how high He reigns!
Triumph and reign, victorious Lord,
By all the flaming hosts adored;
And say, dear Conqueror, say how long
Ere we shall rise to join their song.
Send down a chariot from above,
With fiery wheels, and paved with love;
Raise us beyond th’ethereal blue,
To sing and love as angels do.

(To the tune of “The Adams Family")
We thank the Lord for giving
The food we need for living
Because we really need it
And we like to eat it.
na na na nah (snap fingers twice)
na na na nah (snap fingers twice)
na na na nah (sing three times) 
(then snap fingers twice, last time say Amen)
We’re thirsty and we’re hungry
Want something in our tummy
The food looks mighty yummy
And so we thank the Lord.
We thank you Lord for giving 
The food we need for living
For friends, fun and family
We thank you now oh Lord.

Amidst us our Beloved stands,
And bids us view His pierced hands;
Points to the wounded feet and side,
Blest emblems of the Crucified.
What food luxurious loads the board,
When at His table sits the Lord!
The wine how rich, the bread how sweet,
When Jesus deigns the guests to meet!
If now, with eyes defiled and dim,
We see the signs, but see not Him;
O may His love the scales displace,
And bid us see Him face to face!
O glorious Bridegroom of our hearts,
Your present smile a heav’n imparts!
O lift the veil, if veil there be,
Let every saint Your glory see!

I lift my voice
I lift my praise to you
I lift my hands
I lift my worship to you
And I love you more than I can say
Oh, I love you more than I can say
Ever I will sing, only you will I adore
Glorify my Lord, only you will I serve
For the world will fade away
Still my song to you remains
Only you will I adore
Oh, I love you always (5X)

O what a blessing, how 
can I express it?
Out of the fullness of rapture I sing,
Now by the Father received and adopted,
I am a child and an heir of a King.
I am adopted, O wonderful love,
Heir to a heritage purchased above;
Tell it, my soul, and joyfully sing,
I am a child and an heir of a King.
O what a Father, how tenderly gracious,
O what a Savior to make me His care;
Tho’ I have slighted, rejected, and grieved Him,
Still He permits me His kingdom to share.
O the unsearchable riches He giveth,
Riches increasing from day unto day;
Treasures in value all others excelling,
Treasures that never will rust nor decay.
When I have finished the work He appoints me,
When I have ended my journey below,
Then to my Father and Jesus my Savior,
Home to a beautiful palace I go.

I have found the joy of 
God,
In His sacred, blest abode,
Oh, the comfort of the peace that fills my soul!
And a day His courts within,
Far exceedeth all in sin,
In His secret presence I’m abiding.
I shall see Him, I shall see Him,
I shall see Him in His beauty over there;
In His likeness I’ll behold Him,
He is waiting for me at the portals.
Of my life the fountain spring,
Now my all to Thee I bring,
Thou, O Lord, art all my heart’s supreme delight!
Whom have I in heav’n but Thee?
None on earth so dear to me,
Thou alone art altogether lovely.
How the heav’nly rings,
While my heart in rapture sings
Sweetest anthems of my Savior’s joyful praise;
He’s the fairest of the fair,
Nothing can with Him compare,
He’s to me the chief among ten thousand.
Take the world, for Christ is mine,
In His kingdom I would shine,
Let me labor all my days and years for Him:
Perfect love and bliss abound
In His presence, I have found,
Life is joy supreme and full of glory.

Adore and tremble, for 
our God
Is a consuming fire!
His jealous eyes His wrath inflame,
And raise His vengeance higher.
Almighty vengeance, how it burns!
How bright His fury glows!
Vast magazines of plagues and storms
Lie treasured for his foes.
Those heaps of wrath, by slow degrees,
Are forced into a flame;
But kindled, oh! how fierce they blaze!
And rend all nature’s frame.
At His approach the mountains flee,
And seek a watery grave:
The frighted sea makes haste away,
And shrinks up every wave.
Through the wide air the mighty rocks
Are swift as hailstones hurled;
Who dares engage His fiery rage
That shakes the solid world?
Yet, mighty God, Thy sovereign grace
Sits regent on the throne;
The refuge of Thy chosen race
When wrath comes rushing down.
Thy hand shall on rebellious kings
A fiery tempest pour,
While we beneath Thy sheltering wings
Thy just revenge adore.

Adrift on the waters, so 
dark and so cold,
Afar from the beautiful city of gold,
A vessel is sinking, for heavy the gale,
The cable is broken, and tattered each sail.
Poor child of the wreck, see the lifeboat is near,
A sweet voice is heard, for the Master is here;
He walks every billow, controls every wave,
’Tis Jesus, King Jesus, “the mighty to save."
Oh, I was the sinner alone on the sea,
But love’s blessed signal were floating for me;
Though thunders were rolling, and billows at strife,
Lo, Jesus was calling, “escape for thy life."
I stepped in the life boat, provided for me,
And Jesus my Pilot, my Captain to be;
His bosom my refuge, my “haven of rest."
I’m rescued from shipwreck, so happy and blest.
Life’s turbulent surges are kissed into peace,
The beacons are shining, and songs never cease;
Fair moonbeams, bright sunshine illumine the tide,
While onward to glory we’ll joyfully glide.

The day is fast 
approaching when the Savior shall appear,
And every eye His glory shall behold;
The tokens of His coming fill the loyal heart with cheer
Though strife abounds and love is waxing cold.
We’ll see Him as He is,
And the brightness of His glory we shall share;
We’ll see Him as He is,
And the likeness of His image we shall bear.
In all His Father’s glory, clothed in majesty unveiled,
With myriads of the shining angel band,
The King descends triumphant in Whose might we have prevailed,
And all the ransomed rise at His command.
Oh, may we all as sons of light be watching unto prayer,
For surely our redemption draweth nigh;
With holy zeal and patient faith, let every soul prepare
To join the advent in the sky.

The advent of our God
Our prayers must now employ,
And we must meet Him on His road
With hymns of holy joy.
The everlasting Son
Incarnate deigns to be;
Himself a servant’s form puts on
To set His people free.
Daughter of Zion, rise
To meet thy lowly King,
Nor let thy faithless heart despise
The peace He comes to bring.
As Judge, on clouds of light,
He soon will come again,
And all His scattered saints unite
With Him in Heaven to reign.
Before the dawning day
Let sin’s dark deeds be gone;
The old man all be put away,
The new man all put on.
All glory to the Son
Who comes to set us free,
With Father, Spirit, ever One,
Through all eternity.

As the 
days grow shorter and darkness descends, 
The world refuses to comprehend.
Instead they celebrate with noise and glee; 
A holiday without the Nativity.
(): 
We will fast and give alms as they did long ago, 
We'll feel much lighter, 
Our spirits grow brighter; 
Our hearts will be all aglow.
'Tis a special time to watch and wait; 
It is not yet time to celebrate.
We must strive to bring His love to a world full of hate; 
Draw close to the Savior before it's too late.
() 
This mystery we cannot comprehend; 
That the Father his dear Son He would lend 
To be battered and buffeted and hung on a cross; 
The world still hates Him, to its great loss.
() 
As the time of His blessed Nativity approaches 
We must patiently bear the world's reproaches; 
And watch for His holy birth with awe: 
The Savior who came to fulfill the law.
() 
We wait for this sacred mystery to unfold: 
The incarnation from ages untold.
Then we will celebrate with gladness and joy 
That Christ our Savior was born a baby boy.

Advent tells us Christ 
is near;
Christmas tells us Christ is here!
In Epiphany we trace
all the glory of his grace.
Those three Sundays before Lent
will prepare us to repent;
that in Lent we may begin
earnestly to mourn for sin.
Holy Week and Easter, then,
tell who died and rose agin;
O that happy Easter Day!
"Christ is risen indeed," we say.
Yes, and Christ ascended, too,
to prepare a place for you;
so, we give him special praise,
after those great Forty Days.
Then, he sent the Holy Ghost,
on the Day of Pentecost,
with us ever to abide;
well may we keep Whitsuntide!
Last of all, we humbly sing
glory to our God and King,
glory to the One in Three,
on the Feast of Trinity.

Affirm anew the 
threefold name
pf Father, Spirit, Son,
our God whose saving acts proclaim
a world's salvation won.
In him alone we live and move
and breath and being find,
the wayward children of his love
who cares for humankind.
Declare in all the earth his grace,
to every heart his call,
the living Lord of time and place
whose love embraces all.
So shall his endless praise be sung,
his teaching truly heard,
and every culture, every tongue,
receive his timeless word.
Confirm our faith in this our day
amid earth's shifting sand,
with Christ as life and truth and way,
a rock on which to stand;
the one eternal Son and Lord
by God the Father given,
the true and life-imparting word,
the way that leads to heaven.
Renew once more the ancient fire,
let love our hearts inflame;
renew, restore, unite, inspire
the church that bears your name;
one name exalted over all,
one Father, Spirit, Son,
O grant us grace to heed your call
and in that name be one.

Afflicted saint, to Christ draw near—
Thy Savior’s gracious promise hear,
His faithful Word declares to thee,
That as thy days thy strength shall be.
Let not thy heart despond and say
“How shall I stand the trying day?"
He has engaged by firm decree,
That as thy days thy strength shall be.
Thy faith is weak, thy foes are strong,
And if the conflict should be long,
The Lord will make the tempter flee,
For as thy days thy strength shall be.
Should persecution rage and flame,
Still trust in thy Redeemer’s Name;
In fiery trials thou shalt see,
That as thy days thy strength shall be.
When called to bear thy weighty cross,
Or sore affliction, pain, or loss,
Or deep distress or poverty,
Still as thy days thy strength shall be.

Afflictions do not come alone,
A voice attends the rod;
By both He to His saints is known,
A Father and a God!
Let not My children slight the stroke
I for chastisement send;
Nor faint beneath My kind rebuke,
For still I am their Friend.
The wicked I perhaps may leave
Awhile, and not reprove;
But all the children I receive
I scourge, because I love.
If therefore you were left without
This needful discipline;
You might, with cause, admit a doubt,
If you, indeed, were Mine.
Shall earthly parents then expect
Their children to submit?
And wilt not you, when I correct,
Be humbled at My feet?
To please themselves they oft chastise,
And put their sons to pain;
But you are precious in My eyes,
And shall not smart in vain.
I see your hearts, at present, filled
With grief, and deep distress;
But soon these bitter seeds shall yield
The fruits of righteousness.
Break through the clouds, dear Lord, and shine!
Let us perceive Thee nigh!
And to each mourning child of Thine
These gracious words apply.

Afflictions, though they seem severe;
In mercy oft are sent;
They stopped the prodigal’s career,
And forced him to repent.
Although he no relentings felt
Till he had spent his store;
His stubborn heart began to melt
When famine pinched him sore.
“What have I gained by sin, he said,
But hunger, shame, and fear;
My father’s house abounds with bread,
While I am starving here.
I’ll go, and tell him all I’ve done,
And fall before his face
Unworthy to be called his son,
I’ll seek a servant’s place."
His father saw him coming back,
He saw, and ran, and smiled;
And threw his arms around the neck
Of his rebellious child.
“Father, I’ve sinned—but O forgive!"
I’ve heard enough, he said,
Rejoice my house, my son’s alive,
For whom I mourned as dead.
Now let the fatted calf be slain,
And spread the news around;
My son was dead, but lives again,
Was lost, but now is found.
’Tis thus the Lord His love reveals,
To call poor sinners home;
More than a father’s love He feels,
And welcomes all that come.

Stop, sinner, on your sinful way,
And heed the warning voice today;
Oh, come to Jesus while you may,
For after death the judgment.
After death the judgment,
After death the judgment;
After death the judgment,
Oh, will you be prepared? 
Oh, reason, sinner, will it pay
To cast your only hope away,
And on in sinful darkness stray,
When after death the judgment? 
Oh, think, what will the profit be,
If you should all earth’s pleasures see,
And lose your soul eternally,
When Jesus comes in judgment.
The end of time draws on apace,
And your poor soul, devoid of grace,
The awful wrath of God must face,
When Jesus comes in judgment.

After the lifepaths we’re treading
End upon time’s solemn shore,
There will be light at the river
While the redeemed ones pass o’er.
There will be light at the river,
There will be light at the river,
There will be light at the river,
While the redeemed ones pass o’er.
There will be light for the spirits
Who thro’ deep shadows have come—
Fadeless light shining glad welcome
Out from the windows of home.
There will be light for the weary
Who thro’ sore trials have passed—
Radiant light as they enter,
Peace that for ever shall last.
There will be light for the faithful,
Whate’er the way they have trod—
Glorious light sent to guide them
Safe to the city of God.

After the midnight, morning will greet us;
After the sadness, joy will appear;
After the tempest, sunlight will meet us;
After the jeering, praise we shall hear.
After the shadows, there will be sunshine;
After the frown, the soul-cheering smile;
Cling to the Savior, love Him forever;
All will be well in a little while.
After the battle, peace will be given;
After the weeping, song there will be;
After the journey there will be Heaven,
Burdens will fall and we shall be free.
Shadows and sunshine all thro’ the story,
Teardrops and pleasure, day after day;
But when we reach the kingdom of glory,
Trials of earth will vanish away.

After the mist and shadow,
After the dreary night,
After the sleepless watching,
Cometh the morning light;
Beautiful, soft and tender,
Leading the soul along,
Over the silent river,
Into the land of song.
After the thorny pathway,
After the storms we meet,
After the heart’s deep longing,
Joy and communion sweet;
After the weary conflict,
Rest in the Savior’s love,
Over the silent river,
Safe in the home above.
After the cares and trials,
After the toils and tears,
After the time of sowing,
Reaping thro’ endless years;
After the pilgrim journey,
Rapture that ne’er shall cease,
Over the silent river,
Rest in the land of peace.

Sorrows surround us, while treading life's road 
Troubles confound us, make heavy our load 
Fetters that bound us, no longer will goad
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be 
After the sunrise, happy we'll be - we know 
After the sunrise, Jesus we'll see - in heaven 
All will be glory, singing the story 
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be 
Shadows will vanish, when morning shall come 
Love's light will vanish, in vapors like some 
Even the planets, together will hum 
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be 
Angels are waiting, to carry the news 
Hearts, can the Saviour, no longer refuse 
Cease all your hating, be changing your views 
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be

Again, as evening’s shadow falls,
We gather in these hallowed walls;
And vesper hymn and vesper prayer
Rise mingling on the holy air.
May struggling hearts that seek release
Here find the rest of God’s own peace;
And, strengthened here by hymn and prayer,
Lay down the burden and the care.
O God, our Light! to Thee we bow;
Within all shadows standest Thou;
Give deeper calm than night can bring;
Give sweeter songs than lips can sing.
Life’s tumult we must meet again,
We cannot at the shrine remain;
But in the spirit’s secret cell
May hymn and prayer forever dwell.

From Olive’s Hill, the multitude upgazing,
Beheld, until the Savior passed from view;
But radiant heralds uttered words of promise,
He Who has gone shall come again to you.
Again, again, the nations shall behold Him!
Again, again, enrobed in majesty;
In clouds of glory every eye shall see Him,
Again, again, the King of Glory see!
Again, but not in weakness or in sorrow;
Again, but not for bitter pain and loss;
The Son of God shall come in glory splendid,
Again, but not to bear shame’s bitter cross.
O Zion, clothe thyself in raiment holy;
Lift up thine eyes to greet thy coming King;
Rejoice, rejoice, no more be robed in sorrow,
Rejoice, O Zion, lift thy voice and sing.

Again, O loving Savior,
the children of thy grace
prepare themselves to seek thee
within thy chosen place.
Our song shall rise to greet thee,
if thou our hearts wilt raise;
if thou our lips wilt open,
our mouth shall show thy praise.
The shining choirs of angels
that rest not day or night,
the crowned and palm-decked martyrs,
the saints arrayed in white,
the happy lambs of Jesus
in pastures fair above--
these all adore and praise him,
whom we too praise and love.
The Church on earth rejoices
to join with these today;
in every tongue and nation
she calls her sons to pray;
across the northern snowfields,
beneath the Indian palms,
she makes the same pure offering,
and sings the same sweet psalms.
Tell out, sweet bells, his praises!
Sing, children, sing his Name!
Still louder and still farther
his mighty deeds proclaim,
till all whom he redeemed
shall own him Lord and King,
till every knee shall worship,
and every tongue shall sing.

Again returns the day of holy rest
Which, when He made the world, Jehovah blessed;
When, like His own, He bade our labors cease,
And all be piety, and all be peace.
Let us devote this consecrated day
To learn His will, and all we learn obey;
So shall He hear, when fervently we raise
Our supplications and our songs of praise.
Father in Heaven, in Whom our hopes confide,
Whose power defends us, and Whose precepts guide,
In life our Guardian, and in death our Friend,
Glory supreme be Thine till time shall end.

Again the Lord of light and life
Awakes the kindling ray,
Unseals the eyelids of the morn,
And pours increasing day.
O what a night was that which wrapped
The heathen world in gloom!
O what a Sun which rose this day
Triumphant from the tomb!
This day be grateful homage paid,
And loud hosannas sung;
Let gladness dwell in every heart,
And praise on every tongue.
Ten thousand different lips shall join
To hail this welcome morn,
Which scatters blessings from its wings
To nations yet unborn.

Again the Lord’s own day is here,
The day to Christian people dear,
As, week by week, it bids them tell
How Jesus rose from death and hell.
For by His flock their Lord declared
His resurrection should be shared;
And we who trust in Him to save
With Him are risen from the grave.
We, one and all, of Him possessed,
Are with exceeding treasures blessed,
For all He did, and all He bare,
He gives us as our own to share.
Eternal glory, rest on high,
A blessed immortality,
True peace and gladness, and a throne,
Are all His gifts, and all our own.
And therefore unto Thee we sing,
O Lord of peace, eternal King;
Thy love we praise, Thy Name adore,
Both on this day and evermore.

Again the morn of gladness,
The morn of light, is here;
And earth itself looks fairer,
And Heaven itself more near;
The bells, like angel voices,
Speak peace to every breast;
And all the land lies quiet
To keep the day of rest.
Glory be to Jesus,
Let all His children say;
He rose again, He rose again,
On this glad day.
Again, O loving Savior,
The children of Thy grace
Prepare themselves to seek Thee
Within Thy chosen place.
Our song shall rise to greet Thee,
If Thou our hearts wilt raise;
If Thou our lips wilt open,
Our mouth shall show Thy praise.
The shining choir of angels
That rest not day or night,
The crowned and palm-decked martyrs,
The saints arrayed in white,
The happy lambs of Jesus,
In pastures fair above,
These all adore and praise Him,
Whom we, too, praise and love.
The Church on earth rejoices
To join with these today;
In every tongue and nation
She calls her sons to pray;
Across the northern snow fields,
Beneath the Indian palms,
She makes the same pure offering,
And sings the same sweet psalms.
Tell out, sweet bells, His praises!
O let us sing His Name!
Still louder and still farther
His mighty deeds proclaim;
Till all whom He redeemed
Shall own Him Lord and King,
Till every knee shall worship,
And every tongue shall sing.

Again thy glorious sun doth rise,
I praise Thee, O my Lord;
With courage, strength, and hope renewed,
I touch the joyful chord.
On good and evil, Lord, Thy sun
Is rising as on me;
Let me in patience and in love
Seek thus to be like Thee.
May I in virtue and in faith,
And with Thy gifts content;
Rejoice beneath Thy covering wings,
Each day in mercy sent.
Safe with Thy counsel in my work,
Thee, Lord, I’ll keep in view,
And feel that still Thy bounteous grace
Is every morning new.

Alleluia, Alleluia
For our Lord God Almighty reigns
Alleluia, Alleluia
For our Lord God Almighty reigns
Alleluia
Holy, Holy
Are You Lord God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy is the Lamb
You are Holy
Holy are You Lord God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy is the Lamb
Amen

Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled
Within my heart, that it may be
A quiet chamber kept for Thee.
My heart for very joy doth leap,
My lips no more can silence keep;
I, too, must sing with joyful tongue
That sweetest ancient cradle song.
Glory to God in highest Heaven,
Who unto man His Son hath given;
While angels sing with tender mirth,
A glad new year to all the earth.

Ah, holy Jesus, how hast Thou offended,
That man to judge Thee hath in hate pretended?
By foes derided, by Thine own rejected,
O most afflicted.
Who was the guilty? Who brought this upon Thee?
Alas, my treason, Jesus, hath undone Thee.
’Twas I, Lord, Jesus, I it was denied Thee!
I crucified Thee.
Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered;
The slave hath sinned, and the Son hath suffered;
For man’s atonement, while he nothing heedeth,
God intercedeth.
For me, kind Jesus, was Thy incarnation,
Thy mortal sorrow, and Thy life’s oblation;
Thy death of anguish and Thy bitter passion,
For my salvation.
Therefore, kind Jesus, since I cannot pay Thee,
I do adore Thee, and will ever pray Thee,
Think on Thy pity and Thy love unswerving,
Not my deserving.

Ah! Lord God, the world’s Creator,
King of all, great or small,
Earth’s Regenerator;
Art Thou cradled, art Thou crying,
Swathed and bound, on the ground,
In the stable lying?
“Love of man hath brought Me hither,
Cords of love, from above,
To exalt him thither;
Dead in trespass, child, I sought thee;
Gone astray, from My way,
Life and pardon brought thee."
“Empty be My scrip and coffer,
Yet ’tis wealth, plenty, health,
I am come to offer;
Haste I to enrich and dress thee;
Born to die, low I lie,
And would gladly bless thee."
Therefore thousand thousand praises
Are Thy due, Babe Jesu,
These my heart upraises;
Angels, mortals, furthest, nighest,
Sing in mirth, “Peace on earth,
Glory in the highest."

Ah, what can I do, or where be secure?
If justice pursue, what heart can endure?
When God speaks in thunder and makes Himself known,
The heart breaks asunder though hard as a stone.
With terror I read my sins’ heavy score,
The numbers exceed the sands on the shore;
Guilt makes me unable to stand or to flee,
So Cain murdered Abel, and trembled like me.
Each sin, like his blood, with terrible cry,
Calls loudly on God to strike from on high:
Nor can my repentance, extorted by fear,
Reverse the just sentence; ’tis just, though severe.
The case is too plain, I have my own choice;
Again, and again I slighted His voice;
His warnings neglected, His patience abused,
His Gospel rejected, His mercy refused.
And must I then go, forever to dwell
In torments and woe with devils in hell?
Oh where is the Savior I scorned in times past?
His word in my favor would save me at last.
Lord Jesus, on Thee I venture to call,
Oh look upon me, the vilest of all!
For whom didst Thou languish and bleed on the tree?
Oh pity my anguish, and say, “’Twas for thee."
A case such as mine will honor Thy power;
All hell will repine, all Heav’n will adore;
If in condemnation strict justice takes place,
It shines in salvation more glorious through grace.

Ah, whence to me the bliss,
The joy, the heav'nly sweetness,
That now in torrents pure,
My heart o'erflows,
My soul oh be thou silent,
'Tis thy own sweet Jesus,
Who comes to thee this morn,
To be thy sweet repose.
Sweet Jesus I adore Thee,
Within my happy heart,
To me, O Tender Jesus,
Thy grace and love impart.
My King art Thou sweet Lord,
Though hidden be Thy splendor,
Its radiance ever clear,
In bliss doth shine.
And lowly 'mid its brightness,
Trembling here before Thee,
I kneel and humbly beg,
To taste the sacred stream.
Sweet Jesus I adore Thee,
Within my happy heart,
To me, O Tender Jesus,
Thy grace and love impart.
When death in terror comes,
And folds me in its darkness,
When earth and friends depart,
Wilt Thou be near?
Ah, then, in Thy compassion,
Turn Thine eyes upon me,
And bid me come to Thee,
Then call, then let me hear.
Sweet Jesus I adore Thee,
Within my happy heart,
To me, O Tender Jesus,
Thy grace and love impart.

Ah! whither should I go,
Burdened and sick and faint?
To whom should I my trouble show,
And pour out my complaint?
My Savior bids me come;
Ah! why do I delay?
He calls the weary sinner home,
And yet from Him I stay.
What is it keeps me back,
From which I cannot part,
Which will not let the Savior take
Possession of my heart?
Searcher of hearts, in mine
Thy trying power display;
Into its darkest corners shine,
And take the veil away.
I now believe in Thee,
Compassion reigns alone;
According to my faith, to me
O let it, Lord, be done!
In me is all the bar,
Which Thou wouldst fain remove;
Remove it, and I shall declare
That God is only love.

So you think you paid the baker for the bread you ate to day
And you think you paid the miller for the grain
But no body paid the maker for the things that made it grow
Like the air and the sunshine and the rain.
Now you don't grumble when you pay your room and board
When the land Lord comes around you don't com plain
So the least you can do is thank the Lord
For the air and the sunshine and the rain.
As you travel down the highway in a bright and shiny car
Makes no difference if it's Cadillac or Ford
You must pay for oil and gasoline but air and water's free
Don't you think that you should pause and thank the Lord.

You can be the poorest hobo or the richest man in town
But the things that really count you get your share.
For a man with lots of money sometimes can't afford a smile
While the hobo is a sunshine millionaire. 

Alabare, alabare, alabare a mi Senor[2]
[I'll praise my Lord, for ever more!]
John saw the number, of all those who redeemed,
And all were singing praises to the Lord,
Thousands were praying,
Ten thousands rejoicing
And all were singing praises to the Lord
There is no God as great as You, O Lord,
There is none, there is none!
[repeat]
There is no God who does the mighty wonders
That the Lord our God has done [repeat]
Not with an army, nor with their weapons,

Alas! and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I?
[originally, For such a worm as I?]
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, Thine—
And bathed in its own blood—
While the firm mark of wrath divine,
His Soul in anguish stood.
Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!
Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker died,
For man the creature’s sin.
Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears,
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt my eyes to tears.
But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give my self away
’Tis all that I can do.

Alas! how swift the moments fly!
How flash the years along!
Scarce here, yet gone already by,
The burden of a song.
See childhood, youth, and manhood pass,
And age, with furrowed brow;
Time was—Time shall be—drain the glass—
But where in Time is now?
Time is the measure but of change;
No present hour is found;
The past, the future, fill the range
Of Time’s unceasing round.
Where, then is now? In realms above,
With God’s atoning Lamb,
In regions of eternal love,
Where sits enthroned I AM.
Then pilgrim, let thy joys and tears
On Time no longer lean;
But henceforth all thy hopes and fears
From earth’s affections wean:
To God let votive accents rise;
With truth, with virtue, live;
So all the bliss that Time denies
Eternity shall give.

Wo-men brought spi-ces for Je-sus'
A-noint-ing that had to be done,
But when they ar-rived at the to-mb they
Saw men shin-ing bright as the sun.
They bowed in fear,
Then two an-gels spoke un-to them,
"Why seek ye the liv-ing
A-mong the dead for Him.
The Lord Je-sus Chri-st is ris-en.
He's ris-en fro-m the dead
For God has raised Him up in glo-ry.
He's ris-en a-s he said.
They went and told,
But their words fell on ears deaf.
They sound-ed like tales un-til
Pe-ter saw for him-self.

Mary beheld Him, and “Master!" cried,
After He came from the tomb;
Suddenly Jesus stood in their midst,
Entered the tight shut room.
He Who was dead is alive again!
He Who was dead is alive again!
Broken the stout, icy clutches of death—
He Who was dead is alive again!
Peter beheld Him there on the shore,
Ate with Him there by the sea;
Jesus was saying, with lips once dead,
“Peter, dost thou love Me?"
Thomas beheld Him there in the room,
Called Him his Master and Lord,
Put forth his fingers into the holes
Made by the nails and sword.

Alive alive alive forevermore
My Jesus is alive
Alive forevermore
Alive alive alive forevermore
My Jesus is alive
Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah
My Jesus is alive forevermore
Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah

Have you ever tried to bear your burdens
All alone? All alone?
Don’t you know there’s One Who waits to help you,
Who will make all your burdens His own?
When I have burdens to bear which no one can share,
I take them to Jesus, the Man of Calvary;
When I have crosses to bear, my Savior is there,
And always takes the heavy end, and gives the light to me.
Don’t you know He trod the winepress for you?
All alone? All alone?
And the burden that He bore in meekness,
Such a burden no other has known.
Don’t you know that He has bought your pardon
All alone? All alone?
And your gratitude for such a mercy
Unto Jesus you never have shown.

All as God wills, Who wisely heeds
To give or to withhold,
And knoweth more of all my needs,
Than all my prayers have told.
Enough that blessings undeserved
Have marked my erring track;
That, wheresoe’er my feet have swerved,
His chastening turned me back.
That more and more a providence
Of love is understood,
Making the springs of time and sense
Sweet with eternal good.

All beautiful the march of days, as seasons come and go;
The Hand that shaped the rose hath wrought the crystal of the snow;
Hath sent the hoary frost of Heav’n, the flowing waters sealed,
And laid a silent loveliness on hill and wood and field.
O’er white expanses sparkling pure the radiant morns unfold;
The solemn splendors of the night burn brighter than the cold;
Life mounts in every throbbing vein, love deepens round the hearth,
And clearer sounds the angel hymn, “Good will to men on earth."
O Thou from Whose unfathomed law the year in beauty flows,
Thyself the vision passing by in crystal and in rose,
Day unto day doth utter speech, and night to night proclaim,
In ever changing words of light, the wonder of Thy Name.

Many souls today are dying,
Sin and sorrow is their lot;
Darkness shrouds them with its mantle,
All because we love them not.
All because we do not love them,
Millions fill the heathen grave;
Brother, can you see them perish,
When a little love would save? 
Brother, can we guiltless linger,
When to us the truth is giv’n?
Tearless, see the heathen dying,
Without God or hope of heav’n? 
Love brought Jesus down from glory,
On the cruel cross to die;
Can we say we love the heathen,
If we turn away their cry? 
Love undying, love eternal—
Love will send us o’er the wave,
Will impel us to our duty,
Helpless heathen souls to save.
Jesus said, “Go, teach all nations";
They are lost if we delay;
Can we face Him at the judgment,
If His word we disobey? 

We come to you with a heart of thanks for your love
To be a living sacrifice brought with love
We come to you with a heart of thanks for your love
An offering of all we are brought with love
All creation looks to you
All provision comes from you
In every sunrise hope shines through
For your mercy we thank you
We come to you with a song of praise for your love
The music of our soul's delight brought with love
We come to you with a song of praise for your love
Sounds of joy and gratefulness brought with love

All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou burning sun with golden beam,
Thou silver moon with softer gleam!
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in Heaven along,
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Thou rising moon, in praise rejoice,
Ye lights of evening, find a voice!
Thou flowing water, pure and clear,
Make music for thy Lord to hear,
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Thou fire so masterful and bright,
That givest man both warmth and light.
Dear mother earth, who day by day
Unfoldest blessings on our way,
O praise Him! Alleluia!
The flowers and fruits that in thee grow,
Let them His glory also show.
And all ye men of tender heart,
Forgiving others, take your part,
O sing ye! Alleluia!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
Praise God and on Him cast your care!
And thou most kind and gentle Death,
Waiting to hush our latest breath,
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Thou leadest home the child of God,
And Christ our Lord the way hath trod.
Let all things their Creator bless,
And worship Him in humbleness,
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
And praise the Spirit, Three in One!

All English children call Him, "Lord,"
And all the Spanish say, "Senor,"
With all the Germans who call Him, "Herr."
They are calling His name everywhere.
"O Shuyo," call the Japanese,
"O Tju Ah," echo the Chinese,
"O Hallelujah," they all exclaim.
In each land they are praising His Name.
Children are meeting in Brazil,
Canada, Mexico, Taiwan,
England, New Zealand, and Germany.
Hear them all, as they sing joyfully.

All faded is the glowing light
That once from Heaven shone,
When startled shepherds in the night
The angels came upon.
O shine again, ye angel host,
And say that He is near;
Though but a simple few at most
Believe He will appear.
Ye heavens, that have been growing dark,
Now also are ye dumb;
When shall the listeners say, “Hark!
They’re singing—He will come"?
Lord, come again, O come again,
Come even as Thou wilt;
But not anew to suffer pain,
And strive with human guilt.
O come again, Thou mighty King,
Let earth Thy glory see;
And let us hear the angels sing,
“He comes with victory."

All for Jesus, all for Jesus!
All my being’s ransomed powers:
All my thoughts and words and doings,
All my days and all my hours.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
All my days and all my hours;
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
All my days and all my hours.
Let my hands perform His bidding,
Let my feet run in His ways;
Let my eyes see Jesus only,
Let my lips speak forth His praise.
Worldlings prize their gems of beauty,
Cling to gilded toys of dust,
Boast of wealth and fame and pleasure;
Only Jesus will I trust.
Since my eyes were fixed on Jesus,
I’ve lost sight of all beside;
So enchained my spirit’s vision,
Looking at the Crucified.
Oh, what wonder! how amazing!
Jesus, glorious King of kings,
Deigns to call me His beloved,
Lets me rest beneath His wings.

Sometimes you misunderstand me
Yes, I feel misunderstood
You think that I'm not doin' things
Quite the way I should
Please know I'm only trying to do what's right
For my Father up above
I'm glad to have you smoothin' my rough edges
But please do it out of love
Because
It's all for the good
Yes it's all for the good
You know it's all
Yes I take a Bible in the classroom
To show you I'm a Jesus freak
My only goal's to share the good news
With anyone who seeks
You hit me hard to try and stop me
Then turn to kiss the other cheek
I don't see how you could think
That I'm the one who's weak, no
But
Yes it's all for the good
All for the good
Yeah, it's all
I know the day is coming
When all will be at peace
The lion will lay with the lamb
And colors then will cease
Until that day with God's help
We gotta to make all the peace we can
Though tribulation's bound to come
It's all part of His plan
Oh and
Yes it's all for the good, yeah

Ch: All for You Lord, all for You.
Everything I give to You.
All for You Lord, all for You
Make it all your own
Take my hands and feel , Lord
Take them all for You
They are instruments, Lord put them to your use,
To spread your love and give the good news
All for You my God.
Take my joys and sorrows
And the toil of day,
Take my rest and leisure,
All I'll do today, to serve my brothers
Share with them your joy, all for You my God.
Take my mind, my senses,
Feelings and desires, take my will and freedom,
Take my life entire.
I offer You myself and all I love
All for You my God.

Thou only art holy,
Thou only the Lord;
Truth, mercy and judgment,
Shine forth in Thy Word.
Thou rulest and reignest
All others above;
Thy throne is eternal,
Thy scepter is love.
Thy reign everlasting,
Thy kingdom divine,
Henceforth and forever
All glory be Thine.
Thou only art holy;
In Thee is our trust;
Thy laws are unchanging,
Thy statutes are just.
All nations and people
Before Thee shall fall;
The Father, Redeemer,
And Savior of all.
Thou only art holy;
The angels in light
With prophets and martyrs
Their anthems unite.
Thou only art holy,
O Ancient of days;
The boundless creation
Is filled with Thy praise.

All glory be to God on high,
Who hath our race befriended!
To us no harm shall now come nigh,
The strife at last is ended;
God showeth His goodwill to men,
And peace shall reign on earth again;
O thank Him for His goodness!
We praise, we worship Thee, we trust
And give Thee thanks forever,
O father, that Thy rule is just
And wise, and changes never;
Thy boundless grace o’er all things reigns,
Thou dost whate’er Thy will ordains;
’Tis well Thou art our Ruler!
O Jesus Christ, our God and Lord,
Begotten of the Father,
O Thou Who hast our peace restored,
And the lost sheep dost gather,
Thou Lamb of God, enthroned on high
Behold our need and hear our cry;
Have mercy on us, Jesus!
O Holy Spirit, precious Gift,
Thou Comforter unfailing,
Do Thou our troubled souls uplift,
Against the foe prevailing;
Avert our woes and calm our dread:
For us the Savior’s blood was shed;
Do Thou in faith sustain us!

All glory be to Thee, Most High,
To Thee all adoration;
In grace and truth Thou drawest nigh
To offer us salvation;
Thou showest Thy good will to men,
And peace shall reign on earth again;
We praise Thy Name forever.
We praise, we worship Thee, we trust
And give Thee thanks forever,
O Father, for Thy rule is just
And wise, and changes never;
Thy hand almighty o’er us reigns,
Thou doest what Thy will ordains;
’Tis well for us Thou rulest.
O Jesus Christ, our God and Lord,
Son of the Heavn’ly Father,
O Thou Who hast our peace restored,
The straying sheep dost gather,
Thou Lamb of god, to Thee on high
Out of depths we sinners cry:
Have mercy on us, Jesus!
O Holy Spirit, precious gift,
Thou Comforter unfailing,
From Satan’s snares our souls uplift,
And let Thy power, availing,
Avert our woes and calm our dread.
For us the Savior’s blood was shed;
We trust in Thee to save us.

All glory, laud and honor,
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To Whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.
Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David’s royal Son,
Who in the Lord’s Name comest,
The King and Blessed One.
The company of angels
Are praising Thee on High,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.
The people of the Hebrews
With palms before Thee went;
Our prayer and praise and anthems
Before Thee we present.
To Thee, before Thy passion,
They sang their hymns of praise;
To Thee, now high exalted,
Our melody we raise.
Thou didst accept their praises;
Accept the prayers we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.

All glory to God in the sky,
And peace upon earth be restored!
O Jesus, exalted on high,
Appear our omnipotent Lord:
Who meanly in Bethlehem born,
Didst stoop to redeem a lost race,
Once more to Thy creature return,
And reign in Thy kingdom of grace.
When Thou in our flesh didst appear,
All nature acknowledged Thy birth;
Arose the acceptable year,
And Heaven was opened on earth.
Receiving its Lord from above,
The world was united to bless
The Giver of concord and love,
The Prince and the Author of peace.
O wouldst Thou again be made known,
Again in Thy Spirit descend,
And set up in each of Thine own
A kingdom that never shall end!
Thou only art able to bless,
And make the glad nations obey,
And bid the dire enmity cease,
And bow the whole world to Thy sway.
Come then to Thy servants again,
Who long Thy appearing to know,
Thy quiet and peaceable reign,
In mercy establish below:
All sorrow before Thee shall fly,
And anger and hatred be o’er,
And envy and malice shall die,
And discord afflict us no more.
No horrid alarm of war
Shall break our eternal repose;
No sound of the trumpet is there,
Where Jesus’ Spirit o’erflows:
Appeased by the charms of Thy grace
We all shall in amity join,
And kindly each other embrace,
And love with a passion like Thine.

All glory to Jesus, my loving King,
He blesses me every day;
Sweet Gospel hosannas I gladly sing;
And glory now brightens my way.
Hosanna to Jesus
His blessings are wondrous and free;
I’ll praise Him forever
For He is so precious to me.
I’m marching to Zion, my home above,
The city of God in the sky;
Ere long I shall enter that land of love,
And sing while the ages roll by.
O come and go with me to that bright land,
You all of its glories may share;
May join the glad song of the angel band,
And meet many loved ones up there.

All God's creatures got a place in the choir 
Some sing low and some sing higher 
Some sing out loud on the telephone wire 
Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now.
Listen to the bass; he's the one on the bottom 
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus 
Moans and groans with a big to do 
And the old cow just goes moo.
Dogs and cats they take up the middle 
Where the honey bee hums and the cricket fiddles 
Where the donkey brays and the pony neighs 
And the old grey badger sighs.
Listen to the ducks and the little birds singing 
On the melody with the high notes ringing 
The hoot owl cries over everything 
And the jay bird disagrees.
Singing in the night-time, singing in the day 
The little duck quacks and he's on his way 
The otter hasn't got that much to say 
And the porcupine talks to himself.
It's a simple song, a living song everywhere 
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear 
The grumpy alligator and the hawk above 
The sly old weasel and the turtle dove.

All hail, adored Trinity;
All hail, eternal Unity;
O God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, ever One.
Behold to Thee, this festal day,
We meekly pour our thankful lay;
O let our work accepted be,
That sweetest work of praising Thee.
Three Persons praise we evermore,
One only God our hearts adore;
In Thy sure mercy ever kind
May we our true protection find.
O Trinity! O Unity!
Be present as we worship Thee;
And with the songs that angels sing
Unite the hymns of praise we bring.

All hail the power of Jesus’ Name! Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all.
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all.
Let highborn seraphs tune the lyre, and as they tune it, fall
Before His face Who tunes their choir, and crown Him Lord of all.
Before His face Who tunes their choir, and crown Him Lord of all.
Crown Him, ye morning stars of light, Who fixed this floating ball;
Now hail the strength of Israel’s might, and crown Him Lord of all.
Now hail the strength of Israel’s might, and crown Him Lord of all.
Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God, who from His altar call;
Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod, and crown Him Lord of all.
Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod, and crown Him Lord of all.
Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race, ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all.
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all.
Hail Him, ye heirs of David’s line, Whom David Lord did call,
The God incarnate, Man divine, and crown Him Lord of all,
The God incarnate, Man divine, and crown Him Lord of all.
Sinners, whose love can ne’er forget the wormwood and the gall,
Go spread your trophies at His feet, and crown Him Lord of all.
Go spread your trophies at His feet, and crown Him Lord of all.
Let every tribe and every tongue before Him prostrate fall
And shout in universal song the crowned Lord of all.
And shout in universal song the crowned Lord of all.

All hail, Thou Resurrection!
All hail, Thou Life and Light!
All hail, Thou Self Perfection,
Sole source of grace and might!
Thy Church, O Christ, now greets Thee,
Uprising from the grave;
And every eye that meets Thee
Beholds Thee strong to save.
All hail, beloved Jesus!
For Thou, indeed, art He
Whose death from sin can free us,
Whose life brings liberty.
Hence, let our faith embrace Thee
With warmest hand and eye,
And then delight to trace Thee
Ascending up on high.
O Savior, come in glory,
To raise Thy holy dead,
And end redemption’s story,
With crowns upon Thy head.
Then robed in white before Thee,
Without one stain or tear,
Shall all Thy saints adore Thee,
Midst wonder, love and fear!

All hail to the Prince of Life,
All hail to the Lord divine!
For over the whole glad earth
His glorious light shall shine!
He comes from the tomb of night,
The shadow of death laid by,
He comes as a Conqu’ror comes,
His banner of light on high.
All hail to the Prince of Life!
Hosanna to Him we sing—
He comes as a mighty Victor,
He comes as a conq’ring King!
Go forward ye sons of men
And welcome the glorious King!
Go meet Him with songs of joy
That over His path shall ring!
He brings from the grave of death
The blessing of life and peace,
Who seeks Him shall find a part
In joys that shall never cease.
Then come with your hearts of love
And come with your songs of praise,
For Christ Who hath ris’n indeed
Your anthems of vict’ry raise!
For never in ages past
And never in coming years
Shall Victor and Monarch rise
Like Him Whom the world reveres.

All hail to Thee, Immanuel, we cast our crowns before Thee;
Let every heart obey Thy will, and every voice adore Thee.
In praise to Thee, our Savior King, the vibrant chords of Heaven ring,
And echo back the mighty strain: All hail! All hail! All hail Immanuel!
Hail to the King we love so well! Immanuel! Immanuel!
Hail to the King we love so well! Immanuel! Immanuel!
Glory and honor and majesty, wisdom and power be unto Thee,
Now and evermore!
Hail to the King we love so well! Immanuel! Immanuel!
Hail to the King we love so well! Immanuel! Immanuel!
King of kings and Lord of lords, all hail, Immanuel!
All hail to Thee, Immanuel, the ransomed hosts surround Thee;
And earthly monarchs clamor forth their sovereign King to crown Thee.
While those redeemed in ages gone, assembled round the great white throne,
Break forth into immortal song: All hail! All hail! All hail Immanuel!
All hail to Thee, Immanuel, our risen King and Savior!
Thy foes are vanquished, and Thou art omnipotent forever.
Death, sin and hell no longer reign, and Satan’s pow’r is burst in twain;
Eternal glory to Thy Name: All hail! All hail! All hail Immanuel!

All hail to thee, O blessed morn!
To tidings long by prophets borne
Hast thou fulfillment given.
O sacred and immortal day,
When unto earth, in glorious ray,
Descends the grace of Heaven!
Singing, ringing, sounds are blending,
Praises sending unto Heaven
For the Savior to us given.
’Tis God’s own Image and withal,
The Son of Man, that mortals all
May find in Him a Brother.
He comes, with peace and love to bide
On earth, the erring race to guide
And help as could no other;
Rather gather closer, fonder,
Sheep that wander, feed and fold them,
Than let evil powers hold them.
He tears, like other men, will shed,
Our sorrows share, and be our aid,
Through His eternal power;
The Lord’s good will unto us show,
And mingle in our cup of woe
The drops of mercy’s shower;
Dying, buying through His passion
Our salvation and to mortals
Opening the heavenly portals.
He comes, for our redemption sent,
And by His glory Heaven is rent
To close upon us never;
Our blessed Shepherd He would be,
Whom we may follow faithfully
And be with Him forever;
Higher, nigher glory winging,
Praises singing to the Father
And His Son, our Lord and Savior.

All hail, ye little martyr flowers,
Sweet rosebuds cut in dawning hours!
When Herod sought the Christ to find
Ye fell as bloom before the wind.
First victims of the martyr bands,
With crowns and palms in tender hands,
Around the very altar, gay
And innocent, ye seem to play.
What profited this great offense?
What use was Herod’s violence?
A Babe survives that dreadful day,
And Christ is safely borne away.
All honor, laud, and glory be,
O Jesus, virgin born, to Thee;
All glory, as is ever meet
To Father and to Paraclete.

All heaven declares the glory of the risen Lord,
Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord
Forever He will be the Lamb upon the throne,
I gladly bow the knee and worship Him alone
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord
Who once was slain to reconcile man to God
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the Throne
I gladly bow my knee and worship You alone

Lord I'm tired, so tired from walking
And Lord, I'm so alone
And Lord, the dark is creeping in, creeping up to swallow me
I think I'll stop, rest here awhile.
This is all that I can say right now and (I know it's not much)
This is all that I can give.(repeat)
And didn't you see me crying?
And didn't You hear me call Your name?
Wasn't it You I gave my heart to?
I wish You'd remember where You sat it down,
I didn't notice You were standing here,
I didn't know that that was You holding me.
I didn't notice You were crying too,
I didn't know that that was You washing my feet,

All I do, the church keep a-grumbling
All I do, Lord, all I do
All I do, the church keep a-grumbling
All I do, I do, I do
Yes, all I do, Lord, all I do
All I do, all I do
Try my best for to serve my Master
Try my best for to serve the lord
Try my best for to serve my Master
Hallelujah
Try my best for to follow my Leader
Try my best for to serve the Lord
Try my best for to follow my Leader
Hallelujah
Kneel and pray, so the devil won’t harm me
Try my best for to serve the lord
Kneel and pray, so the devil won’t harm me
Hallelujah
I’m going to cling to the ship of Zion
Try my bet for to serve the Lord
I’m going to cling to the ship of Zion
Hallelujah

I don't know why, I can't see how
Your precious blood could cleanse me now
When all this time, I've lived a lie,
with no excuse, no alibi
All I know is I find mercy,
All my shame You take from me
All I know Your cross has power, 
and the blood You shed cleanses me
It's way beyond what I can see,
how anyone could die for me
So undeserved, this precious grace,
You've won my heart, I'll see your face

Jesus Christ is made to me,
All I need, all I need,
He alone is all my plea,
He is all I need.
Wisdom righteousness and pow’r,
Holiness forevermore,
My redemption full and sure,
He is all I need.
Jesus is my all in all,
All I need, all I need,
While He keeps I cannot fall,
He is all I need.
He redeemed me when He died,
All I need, all I need,
I with Him was crucified,
He is all I need.
Glory, glory to the Lamb,
All I need, all I need,
By His Spirit sealed I am,
He is all I need.

I could fill every minute 
So many things to do
I could serve You all my days
But not really know
For You have given me 
All these things
But I see
All I really need is You, by me
All I really need is You, inside me
For I realize, you satisfy my soul
All I really need is You
You've provided for my every need
And if I should complain about anything
Lord, remind me 
You have given me
All these things
Now I see

In the morning when I rise
Expectantly I lift my eyes
And I see You (echo)
Gazing on Your heavenly throne
In Your presence I'm at home
Here with You (echo)
All I want is more
And more of You
Earthly cares and passions pale
When You tke away the veil
And I see You (echo)
When You open heaven's door
All I want to have is more
More of You (echo)
And all I want
Is more and more of You
The earth and all its glory will fade
But the word of our God will stand
The earth and all its glory will fade
But the kingdom of God I will see
Nothing in the world compares
To the love that I can share
Alone with You (echo)
There is nothing else so real
As the things as You reveal
When I'm with You (echo)

Take my hand, lead me, Lord
Take me to your door
Cover me with your blood
That's all I'm asking for, that's all I'm asking for
Every day and every night it feel the same
When I come to the end of the road
But you Spirit give me power when I call on your name
The wonderful name of the Lord
It's a rush and it's a high that won't ever leave
When I look into the eyes of the one
Who can heal me, who can free me to fly again
Straight to the arms of the son
That's all I'm asking for
You go through all the broken places
Giving me the hope to try again

You are my strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all
Seeking you as a precious jewel
Lord to give up, I'd be a fool
You are my all in all
Jesus Lamb of God, worthy is Your name
Jesus Lamb of God, worthy is Your name
Taking my sin my cross, my shame
Rising again, I bless Your name
You are my all in all
When I fall down, You pick me up
When I am dry, You fill my cup
You are my all in all

Truth and beauty
And happiness
It’s all in the name of Jesus
Health and heaven
Peace and rest
It’s all in the name of Jesus
Joy and gladness
Forgiveness too
There’s life everlasting and free.
All that I long for
And all I need
It’s all in the name of Jesus
There’s a welcome
A pardon and a hiding place
They’re all in the name of Jesus
Harvest and sunshine
Friendship too
Fulfilment and blessing untold
Hope for tomorrow
And help for today
It’s all in the name of Jesus 

All in the silent night,
Numberless angels bright
Came on their wings of light
Thronging the deep blue sky;
Beautiful songs they sang,
Wonderful echoes rang;
Glory to Christ our King,
Glory to God on high.
Glory, glory to God!
Glory, glory to God,
Glory, all glory to God on high!
Let every listening heart reply;
Glory, glory to God!
Glory, glory to God,
Far let the joyful tidings fly;
All glory to God on high!
Join in the song so sweet,
Now with the shepherds meet,
Haste to the Savior’s feet,
Worship the Child divine;
Come with the men of old,
Nor let the heart withhold
Aught of its purest gold;
All to the King resign.
Broken the shades of night;
Hail to the Dayspring bright!
Spreading the blessed light,
Tell of a Savior born,
Till all mankind shall see
Mercy, so great and free,
Till on this earth shall be
Dawn of eternal morn.

Jesus, Thou a fountain art,
Springing up within my heart;
Fount of joy and happiness,
Source of everlasting bliss.
All is joy, all is peace,
With my Jesus in my breast;
All my soul can wish I find,
O my Lord, in Thee combined.
Precious rest I’ve found in Thee,
Rest from care and trouble free;
While eternal ages roll,
Nothing can disturb my soul.
Savior, Thou dost shine within,
Since my heart is free from sin;
Holy pleasures now abide,
And my soul is satisfied.
Jesus, tune my heart to sing
All the glory Thou dost bring;
While Thy name and throne endure,
Every good to me is sure.
Lord, my life, the truth, the way,
In my heart the light of day;
Thou my hope and portion be,
Jesus, all in all to me.

All is o’er, the pain, the sorrow,
Human taunts and fiendish spite;
Death shall be despoiled tomorrow
Of the prey he grasps tonight;
Yet awhile, His own to save,
Christ must linger in the grave.
Dark and still the cell that holds Him,
While in brief repose He lies;
Deep the slumber that enfolds Him,
Veiled awhile from mortal eyes;
Slumber such as needs must be
After hard won victory.
Fierce and deadly was the anguish
Which on yonder cross He bore;
How did soul and body languish
Till the toil of death was o’er:
But that toil, so fierce and dread,
Bruised and crushed the serpent’s head.
All night long, with plaintive voicing,
Chant His requiem soft and low:
Loftier strains of loud rejoicing
From tomorrow’s harps shall flow:
“Death and hell at length are slain!
Christ hath triumphed! Christ doth reign!"

Sitting in my boat fishing in the sea
Putting out my net and oh so carefully
When it comes back, well what will it be?
All kinds of fishes when you're fishing in the sea 
All kinds of fishes when you're fishing in the sea 
Big school of dolphins splashing in the sun
They don't care much, they're just having fun
Over to the left a jellyfish in tow
Following the current wherever it may go 
Catfish make you wait all day
Then he grabs the bait and tries to run away
Bringing in starfish really is a cinch
'Cause he sits on the bottom 
And doesn't move an inch 
Fisherman, I wanna be God's fisherman
If it weren't for all of those scales and fins
I'd say fish were just like men
Fisherman, I wanna be God's fisherman
Well the Lord told me to cast my net
Though I'm not finished yet
I am a fisherman! 
If you're dealing with a shark, never pick a fight
They've got a big mouth eating everything in sight
A whale snacked Jonah, we know this is true
He may be a giant but his heart is big too 
Crab is one nut that's tough to crack
With great big claws and thick-skinned back
Swordfish got a great big snout
But they never give up and they never give out 
(x
All kinds of fishes when you're fishing in the sea 
I am a fisherman! 

All labor gained new dignity
since he who all creation made
toiled with his hands for daily bread
right manfully.
No work is commonplace, if all
be done as unto him alone;
life's simplest toil to him is known
who knoweth all.
Each smallest common thing he makes
serves him with its minutest part;
man only with his wand'ring heart
his way forsakes.
His service is life's highest joy,
it yields fair fruit a hundred fold:
be this our prayer--"Not fame, nor gold,
but--thine employ!"

All lands, to God in joyful sounds
Aloft your voices raise;
Sing forth the honor of His Name,
And glorious make His praise,
And glorious make His praise.
Say ye to God, how terrible
In all Thy works art Thou!
To Thee Thy foes by Thy great power
Shall be constrained to bow,
Shall be constrained to bow.
Yea, all the earth shall worship Thee,
And unto Thee shall sing;
To Thy great Name shall songs of joy
With loud hosannas ring,
With loud hosannas ring.
O come, behold the works of God,
His mighty doings see;
In dealing with the sons of men
Most wonderful is He,
Most wonderful is He.
He led in safety through the flood
The people of His choice,
He turned the sea to solid ground;
In Him let us rejoice,
In Him let us rejoice.
He rules forever by His might,
His eyes the nations try;
Let not the proud, rebellious ones
Exalt themselves on high,
Exalt themselves on high.

All mankind fell in Adam’s fall,
One common sin infects us all;
From sire to son the bane descends,
And over all the curse impends.
Thro’ all man’s powers corruption creeps
And him in dreadful bondage keeps;
In guilt he draws his infant breath
And reaps its fruits of woe and death.
From hearts depraved, to evil prone,
Flow thoughts and deeds of sin alone;
God’s image lost, the darkened soul
Nor seeks nor finds its heav’nly goal.
But Christ, the second Adam, came
To bear our sin and woe and shame,
To be our Life, our Light, our Way,
Our only Hope, our only Stay.
As by one man all mankind fell
And, born in sin, was doomed to hell,
So by one Man, Who took our place,
We all received the gift of grace.
We thank Thee, Christ; new life is ours,
New light, new hope, new strength, new powers:
This grace our every way attend
Until we reach our journey’s end!

All men living are but mortal,
Yea, all flesh must fade as grass;
Only through death’s gloomy portal
To eternal life we pass.
This frail body here must perish
Ere the heav’nly love joys it cherish,
Ere it gain the free reward
For the ransomed of the Lord.
Therefore, when my God doth choose it,
Willingly I’ll yield my life
Nor will grieve that I should lose it,
For with sorrows it was rife.
In my dear Redeemer’s merit
Peace hath found my troubled spirit,
And in death my comfort this:
Jesus’ death my source of bliss.
Jesus for my sake descended
My salvation to obtain;
Death and hell for me are ended,
Peace and hope are now my gain;
Yea, with joy I leave earth’s sadness
For the home of heav’nly gladness,
Where I shall forever see
God, the Holy Trinity.
There is joy beyond our telling,
Where so many saints have gone;
Thousands, thousands, there are dwelling,
Worshiping before the throne,
There the seraphim are shining,
Evermore in joining:
“Holy, holy, holy Lord!
Triune God, for aye adored!"
Patriarchs of sacred story
And the prophets there are found;
The apostles, too, in glory
On twelve seats are there enthroned,
All the saints that have ascended
Age on age, through time extended,
There in blissful concert sing
Hallelujahs to their King.
O Jerusalem, how glorious
Dost thou shine, thou city fair!
Lo, I hear the tone victorious
Ever sweetly sounding there.
Oh, the bliss that there surprises!
Lo, the sun of morn now rises,
And the breaking day I see
That shall never end for me.
Yea, I see what here was told me,
See that wondrous glory shine,
Feel the spotless robes enfold me,
Know a golden crown is mine,
Thus before the throne so glorious
Now I stand a soul victorious,
Gazing on that joy for aye
That shall never pass away.

I have lived among you (lived among you) here on earth (here on earth)
I have shown you love (I have shown you love)
I have shown you worth (shown you just how much you’re worth)
Now it’s nearly over (now it’s over) you will find (you will find)
That the spirit will remind you
Of all the things I had in mind
Now I want you to remember
All men will know (all men will know)
All men will find (all men will find)
All men will see (all men will see)
That you are mine (that you are Mine)
Now the time is coming (time is coming) I must go (I must go)
But the Comforter will guide you (He will be your guide)
In the things you need to know (show you what you need to know)
No it won’t be easy (it’s not easy) you will see (you will see)
They will hate you and despise you
All the same they did to me (they will do to you the same to me)
Now I want you to remember
Very soon His own disciples found
The testing quickly came around
To share their faith with boldness, without fear (without fear)
Now today we face an equal test
Divinely called to do our best
To share with the world - what will they hear? (what will they hear?)
All men will know (all men will know) (all will know)
All men will find (all men will find) (all will find)
All men will see (all men will see) (all will see)
That you are mine (that you are Mine) (that you are mine)
All men will know [held]

All mortal vanities, begone,
Nor tempt my eyes, nor tire my ears;
Behold, amidst th’eternal throne,
A vision of the Lamb appears.
Glory His fleecy robe adorns,
Marked with the bloody death He bore;
Seven are His eyes, and seven His horns,
To speak His wisdom and His power.
Lo! He receives a sealed book
From Him that sits upon the throne;
Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look
On dark decrees and things unknown.
All the assembling saints around
Fall worshipping before the Lamb,
And in new songs of Gospel sound
Address their honors to His Name.
The joy, the shout, the harmony,
Flies o’er the everlasting hills
“Worthy art Thou alone," they cry,
“To read the book, to loose the seals."
Our voices join the heav’nly strain,
And with transporting pleasure sing,
“Worthy the Lamb that once was slain,
To be our Teacher and our King!"
His words of prophecy reveal
Eternal counsels, deep designs;
His grace and vengeance shall fulfill
The peaceful and the dreadful lines.
Thou hast redeemed our souls from hell
With Thine invaluable blood;
And wretches that did once rebel
Are now made favorites of their God.
Worthy forever is the Lord,
That died for treasons not His own,
By every tongue to be adored,
And dwell upon His Father’s throne!

All my heart this night rejoices,
As I hear, far and near, sweetest angel voices;
“Christ is born," their choirs are singing,
Till the air, everywhere, now their joy is ringing.
For it dawns, the promised morrow
Of His birth, Who the earth rescues from her sorrow.
God to wear our form descendeth;
Of His grace to our race here His Son He sendeth.
Yea, so truly for us careth,
That His Son, all we've done, as our offering beareth;
As our Lamb Who, dying for us,
Bears our load, and to God, doeth in peace restore us.
Hark! a voice from yonder manger,
Soft and sweet, doth entreat, “Flee from woe and danger;
Brethren, come; from all that grieves you
You are freed; all you need I will surely give you."
Come, then, let us hasten yonder;
Here let all, great and small, kneel in awe and wonder,
Love Him Who with love is yearning;
Hail the star that from far bright with hope is burning.
Ye who pine in weary sadness,
Weep no more, for the door now is found of gladness.
Cling to Him, for He will guide you
Where no cross, pain or loss, can again betide you.
Hither come, ye poor and wretched:
Know His will is to fill every hand outstretched;
Here are riches without measure,
Here forget all regret, fill your hearts with treasure.
Blessed Savior, let me find Thee!
Keep Thou me close to Thee, cast me not behind Thee!
Life of life, my heart Thou stillest,
Calm I rest on Thy breast, all this void Thou fillest.
Thee, dear Lord, with heed I’ll cherish;
Live to Thee and with Thee, dying, shall not perish;
But shall dwell with Thee for ever,
Far on high, in the joy that can alter never.
Forth today the Conqueror goeth,
Who the foe, sin and woe, death and hell, o’erthroweth.
God is man, man to deliver;
His dear Son now is one with our blood forever.
Shall we still dread God’s displeasure,
Who, to save, freely gave His most cherished Treasure?
To redeem us, He hath given
His own Son from the throne of His might in Heaven.
Should He who Himself imparted
Aught withhold from the fold, leave us broken hearted?
Should the Son of God not love us,
Who, to cheer sufferers here, left His throne above us?
If our blessed Lord and Maker
Hated men, would He then be of flesh partaker?
If He in our woe delighted,
Would He bear all the care of our race benighted?
He becomes the Lamb that taketh
Sin away and for aye full atonement maketh.
For our life His own He tenders
And our race, by His grace, meet for glory renders.

All my heart with joy is springing,
While in air everywhere
Angel choirs are singing.
Hear them to the shepherds telling:
“Christ is born! On this morn
God with man is dwelling."
To this lower world descendeth,
From above, He whose love
All our sorrows endeth.
He who breath and being gave us,
Quits the skies, lives and dies
In our flesh to save us.
Christ our Lamb so meek and loving
Dries our tears, calms our fears,
All our sins removing;
Christ our Lamb, who suffers with us;
He can quell death and hell,
And to peace restore us.
Hark, from yon dark manger lowly,
Breezes soft seem to waft
Gentle words and holy:
“Sigh no more, away with sadness
Brethren dear; I am here,
Bringing hope and gladness."
Come ye now, and kneel before Him;
Mortals all, great and small,
Worship and adore Him:
Love your King, whose love invites you:
Lo, His star from afar
To His dwelling lights you.
Ye, whom galling want oppresses
Here ye find comfort kind,
Balm for your distresses:
Noblest treasures here are given;
Riches true wait for you
Poor of Christ, in Heaven.
Ye who strive with fierce temptation,
Sorrow-stung, conscience-wrung,
Here is consolation:
For the woes which men inherit
Christ can feel, Christ will heal
Every wounded spirit.
Kind Redeemer, knit Thee to us;
Quelling sin, reign within,
With Thy grace renew us:
Make us Thine by true repentance;
Let us hear, free from fear,
Lord, Thy final sentence.
Ours be Thy pure love, O Savior,
Ours Thy faith, strong in death,
Ours Thy meek behavior;
Here let us, on Thee depending,
In Thee die, with Thee fly
To the bliss unending.

All my hope on God is founded;
He doth still my trust renew,
Me through change and chance He guideth,
Only good and only true.
God unknown, He alone
Calls my heart to be His own.
Pride of man and earthly glory,
Sword and crown betray His trust;
What with care and toil He buildeth,
Tower and temple fall to dust.
But God’s power, hour by hour,
Is my temple and my tower.
God’s great goodness aye endureth,
Deep His wisdom, passing thought:
Splendor, light and life attend him,
Beauty springeth out of naught.
Evermore from His store
Newborn worlds rise and adore.
Daily doth th’almighty Giver
Bounteous gifts on us bestow;
His desire our soul delighteth,
Pleasure leads us where we go.
Love doth stand at His hand;
Joy doth wait on His command.
Still from man to God eternal
Sacrifice of praise be done,
High above all praises praising
For the gift of Christ, His Son.
Christ doth call one and all:
Ye who follow shall not fall.

My Freedom, my Reason 
My Savior, that's what You are to me 
You free me completely 
My Savior, that's what You are 
There's no other like You 
There's no one beside You 
You're more than my heart can contain 
And I will love You all my life 
For You are my reason, 
the One that I live for 
And I will love You all my life 
For You are my reason, You're the One that I live for.
BRIDGE:
You're the One that I live for.

All my life I had a longing
For a drink from some clear spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings,
Through His blood I now am saved.
Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.
Poor I was, and sought for riches,
Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me
Only mocked my soul’s sad cry.
Well of water, ever springing,
Bread of life so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.

When I go don't cry for me
In my fathers arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away

If religion was a thing
That money could buy,
The rich would live
And the poor would die.
All my trials, Lord,
Will soon be over.
Too late my brothers,
Too late but never mind,
All my trials, Lord,
Will soon be over.
Go to sleep, my little baby,
And don't you cry,
Your daddy was born
Just to live and die.
Oh I have a little book
That sets me free,
My bible, it spells
"Liberty".
Yes, a man was born
To suffer agony,
His will to live
Spells "Victory".

All nations, clap your hands,
Let shouts of triumph ring,
For mighty over all the lands
The Lord Most High is King.
Above our mighty foes
He gave us power to stand,
And as our heritage He chose
The goodly promised land.
With shouts ascends our King,
With trumpet’s stirring call;
Praise God, praise God, His praises sing,
For God is Lord of all.
O sing in joyful strains,
And make His glory known;
God over all the nations reigns,
And holy is His throne.
Our fathers’ God to own
The kings of earth draw nigh,
For none can save but God alone,
He is the Lord Most High.

All nature feels attractive power,
A strong, embracing force;
The drops that sparkle in the shower,
The planets in their course.
In this fine, sympathetic chain
All creatures bear a part;
Their every pleasure, every pain,
Linked to a feeling heart.
More perfect bond, the Christian plan
Attaches soul to soul;
Our neighbor is the suffering man
Thou at the farthest pole.
To earth below, from Heaven above,
The faith in Christ professed
More clear reveals that God is love,
And whom He loves is blest.

All nature’s works His praise declare, to Whom they all belong;
There is a voice in every star, in every breeze a song.
Sweet music fills the world abroad with strains of love and power;
The stormy sea sings praise to God, the thunder and the shower.
To God the tribes of ocean cry, and birds upon the wing;
To God the powers that dwell on high their tuneful tribute bring.
Like them, let us the throne surround, with them loud raise,
While instruments of loftier sound assist our feeble praise.
Great God, to Thee we consecrate our voices and our skill;
We bid the pealing organ wait to speak alone Thy will.
Lord, while the music round us floats may earth born passions die;
O grant its rich and swelling notes may lift our souls on high!

Bear the good tidings all over the world,
Let the bright banner of love be unfurled,
Wherever sorrow and sin shall be found,
There let the news of salvation resound.
All over the world,
All over the world,
Let the bright banner of love be unfurled,
All over the world.
Plant in the wilderness Sharon’s sweet rose,
Blessing will follow wherever it goes;
Led, onward led by the Lord’s guiding hand,
Open “fresh springs" in the dry, thirsty land.
Think of the millions who never have heard
One precious promise from God’s holy Word;
Think of the lives marred and darkened by sin,
Tell them the story that brings light within.
Oh, what a song shall in Heaven be sung!
By every nation and kindred and tongue;
Some may be there through our efforts and prayer,
Joy everlasting together we’ll share.

All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell;
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
Without our aid He did us make;
We are His folk, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
O enter then His gates with praise;
Approach with joy His courts unto;
Praise, laud, and bless His Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
For why? the Lord our God is good;
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom Heaven and earth adore,
From men and from the angel host
Be praise and glory evermore.

All praise be to God, whom all things obey,
From angels and men for ever and aye:
Who sendeth on earth the powers of His throne,
His providence good and love to make known.
His angels are they of countenance fair,
The arm of His strength, His hand of kind care:
His message of peace to us they reveal,
His wisdom most high they seal or unseal.
By martyrs of old they stood in the flame,
And bade them not flinch, but call on God’s Name.
Thro’ torment, thro’ shame, thro’ darkness of death
They led without fear the sires of our faith.
They stand with the few, they fight for the free,
God’s reign to advance o’er land and o’er sea:
And when the brave die or fall in the fight,
Their spirits they bear to rest in God’s sight.
For patience and toil a crown they prepare;
They found for the meek a kingdom full fair;
No famine nor plague ’gainst them doth prevail;
Their bread cannot lack, their cruse cannot fail.
We pray Thee, Who art Thy angels’ reward,
Thy flock to defend forget not, O Lord;
But prosper their aid, that us they may bring
To see the true face of Jesus, our King.

All praise the Father 
throned above 
Who’s showered us with endless love.
Our hope and strength in time of need 
Defender, and our Lord indeed.
How vast His arms stretch open wide 
For us sinners; He came and died.
He hides us in His mighty wings 
Protecting us from evil things.
God’s glory in abundance flows.
He shines His light so the world knows, 
That He’ll stand by us through our days, 
And loves despite our sinful ways.
“Alleluia," we praise His name 
All living things shall know His fame.
“Alleluia," our songs raise high 
Of our Savior who came to die.

All praise to Him Who dwells in bliss,
Who made both day and night;
Whose throne is darkness, in th’abyss
Of uncreated light.
Each thought and deed His piercing eyes
With strictest search survey;
The deepest shades no more disguise
Than the full blaze of day.
Whom Thou dost guard, O King of kings,
No evil shall molest;
Under the shadow of Thy wings,
Shall they securely rest.
Thy angels shall around their beds
Their constant stations keep;
Thy faith and truth shall shield their heads,
For Thou dost never sleep.
May we, with calm and sweet repose,
And heavenly thoughts refreshed,
Our eyelids with the morn’s unclose,
And bless the Ever-blessed.

All praise to Him Who reigns above
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem!
Blessed be the Name! Blessed be the Name!
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
Blessed be the Name! Blessed be the Name!
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
His Name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father’s own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.
Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation’s plan,
For Thou hast died for all.
His Name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace,
Of all earth’s kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

All praise to our redeeming Lord,
Who joins us by His grace;
And bids us, each to each restored,
Together seek His face.
He bids us build each other up;
And, gathered into one,
To our high calling’s glorious hope,
We hand in hand go on.
The gift which He on one bestows,
We all delight to prove;
The grace through every vessel flows,
In purest streams of love.
E’en now we think and speak the same,
And cordially agree;
Concentered all, through Jesus’ Name,
In perfect harmony.
We all partake the joy of one;
The common peace we feel;
A peace to sensual minds unknown,
A joy unspeakable.
And if our fellowship below
In Jesus be so sweet,
What height of rapture shall we know
When round His throne we meet!

All praise to Thee, Eternal Lord,
Clothed in a garb of flesh and blood;
Choosing a manger for Thy throne,
While worlds on worlds are Thine alone.
Once did the skies before Thee bow;
A virgin’s arms contain Thee now,
While angels, who in Thee rejoice,
Now listen for Thine infant voice.
A little Child, Thou art our Guest,
That weary ones in Thee may rest;
Forlorn and lowly is Thy birth;
That we may rise to Heaven from earth.
Thou comest in the darksome night
To make us children of the light;
To make us, in the realms divine,
Like Thine own angels round Thee shine.
All this for us Thy love hath done;
By this to Thee our love is won;
For this we tune our cheerful lays,
And sing our thanks in ceaseless praise.

All praise to Thee, my God, this night,
For all the blessings of the light!
Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
Beneath Thine own almighty wings.
Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
The ill that I this day have done,
That with the world, myself, and Thee,
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.
Teach me to live, that I may dread
The grave as little as my bed.
Teach me to die, that so I may
Rise glorious at the judgment day.
O may my soul on Thee repose,
And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
Sleep that may me more vigorous make
To serve my God when I awake.
When in the night I sleepless lie,
My soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
No powers of darkness me molest.
O when shall I, in endless day,
For ever chase dark sleep away,
And hymns divine with angels sing,
All praise to thee, eternal King?
Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

All praise to Saint Patrick,
who brought to our mountains
The gift of God's faith,
the sweet light of His love.
All praise to the Shepherd
who showed us the fountains
That rise in the Heart
of the Saviour above.
For hundreds of years,
In smiles and in tears,
Our Saint hath been with us,
our shield and our stay;
All else may have gone,
Saint Patrick alone.
He hath been to us light,
when earth's lights were all set,
For the glories of faith
they can never decay,
And the best of our glories
is bright with us yet,
in the faith and the feast
of Saint Patrick's day.
There is not a Saint
in the bright courts of heaven,
More faithful than he
to the land of his choice;
Oh well may the nation
to whom he was given,
In the feast of their Sire
and apostle rejoice.
In Glory above
True to his love,
He keeps the false faith
from his children away.
The dark false faith
Far worse than death.
Oh he drives it far off
from the green sunny shore,
Like the reptiles that fled
from his curse in dismay,
And Erin when error's
proud triumph is o'er,
Will still be found keeping
Saint Patrick's day.
Then what shall we do
for the heaven sent father?
What shall the proof
of our loyalty be?
By all that is dear
to our hearts we would rather
Be martyred sweet Saint,
than bring shame upon thee.
But oh, he will take
The promise we make,
So to live that our lives
by God's help, may display
The light that he bore
To Erin's shore.
Oh Yes Father of Ireland!
no child wilt thou own
Whose life is not lighted
by grace on its way;
For they are true Irish,
ah yes, they alone,
Whose hearts are all true
on Saint Patrick's day.

All prophets hail thee, from of old announcing,
by the inbreathed Spirit of the Father,
God's Mother, bringing prophecies to fullness,
Mary the maiden.
Thou the true Virgin Mother of the Highest,
Bearing incarnate God in awed obedience,
meekly acceptest for a sinless offspring
purification.
In the high temple Simeon receives thee,
takes to his bent arms with a holy rapture
that promised Savior, vision of redemption,
Christ long awaited.
Now the fair realm of Paradise attaining,
and to thy Son's throne, Mother of the Eternal,
raised all glorious, yet in earth's devotion
join with us always.
Glory and worship to the Lord of all things
pay we unresting, who alone adored,
Father and Son and Spirit, in the highest
reigneth eternal.

There was a holy hush all over
As I walked into the room
And as I stood to see Him face to face
I was gloriously made new
There was a great and awesome presence
And a light bright as any day
And as I bowed to kneel with the angels
I hear the Spirit say (oh, heard it say)
All rise (all rise), all rise (all rise)
To stand before the throne
In the presence of the Holy One
All rise (all rise), all rise (all rise)
As we worship the Messiah
All rise
Then I looked at those all around me
With their hands uplifted high
And the Spirit laid His hands on me
And I uplifted mine (alleluia)
And He was singing alleluias
And praises to His name (praise Your Holy name)
And as I bowed to kneel with the angels
I heard the Spirit say (heard it say)
Singing holy, holy, holy (holy, holy)
Worthy is the Lamb (worthy)
Who was, and is, and is to come (who was)
He is the great I AM (the great I AM)
(Let the church arise and stand, Let the church arise and stand)
All rise
All rise

All shall be well! For on our Easter skies
see Christ the sun of righteousness arise.
All shall be well! The sacrifice is made,
the sinner freed, the price of pardon paid.
All shall be well! The cross and passion past,
dark night is done, bright morning come at last.
All shall be well! Lift every voice on high;
"Death has no more dominion but shall die."
Jesus alive! Rejoice and sing again;
all shall be well for evermore, Amen!

All that I am
I rest in Your hands
To work out Your purpose
And Your perfect plan
So all I would do
Would be unto You
And You would have all that I am
For You are the only Lord
My only redeemer
So gracious, So faithful
You carry me on
When Your voice seems so silent
I still know Your presence
For You Lord are all that I am

All that I am I owe to Thee,
Thy wisdom, Lord, has fashioned me;
I give my Maker thankful praise,
Whose wondrous works my soul amaze.
Ere into being I was brought,
Thine eye did see, and in Thy thought
My life in all its perfect plan
Was ordered ere my days began.
Thy thoughts, O God, how manifold,
More precious unto me than gold!
I muse on their infinity,
Awaking I am still with Thee.
The wicked Thou shalt surely slay,
From me let sinners turn away;
They speak against the Name divine,
I count God’s enemies as mine.
Search me, O God, my heart discern,
Try me, my inmost thought to learn;
And lead me, if in sin I stray,
To choose the everlasting way.

There is one thing that I know I will do,
I will be holding on to You.
And when the dark clouds come
And bring down the rain,
I know that You will sustain me Lord.
Your love is all that I need,
All that I need, all that I need.
Your love is all that I need,
All that I need is You.
Jesus You know what's inside of my heart,
When I am coming apart at the seams.
But that's when my true colours
Come shining through,
I know that You are the One for me.

All that I was, my sin, my guilt,
My death, was all mine own;
All that I am I owe to Thee,
My gracious God, alone.
The evil of my former state
Was mine, and only mine;
The good in which I now rejoice
Is Thine, and only Thine.
The darkness of my former state,
The bondage, all was mine;
The light of life in which I walk,
The liberty, is Thine.
Thy Word first made me feel my sin,
It taught me to believe;
Then, in believing, peace I found,
And now I live, I live!
All that I am, e’en here on earth
All that I hope to be,
When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
I owe it, Lord to Thee.

ALL that I was, my sin, my guilt,
My death, was all mine own;
ALL that I am, I owe to Thee,
My gracious God, alone.
The evil of my former state,
Was mine and only mine;
The good in which I now rejoice,
Is Thine, and only Thine.
The darkness of my former state,
The bondage -- all was mine;
The light of life in which I walk,
The liberty -- is Thine.
The grace that made me feel my sin,
It taught me to believe;
Then, in believing, peace I found,-
And now I live, I live.
All that I am, e'en here on earth,
All that I hope to be,
When Jesus comes and glory dawns, 
I owe it, Lord, to Thee.

All that our Savior hath spoken
Came from the heart of God;
Surely it cannot be broken,
Sealed with His precious blood.
Tempests may rage and thunder,
Mountains be rent asunder,
Nations may fear and wonder—
Trust, and be undismayed.
As unto Abram was given
God’s cov’nant word of peace,
“Counting the stars" of the even—
So shall thy faith increase.
Trust when the light warm and tender
Seemeth to Thee withdrawn;
Wait a few hours, and in splendor
Morning again will dawn!
Trust! tho’ all others forsake thee,
Yet there remains one Friend;
Mercy and truth shall o’ertake thee
Down to thy journey’s end.
Trust under every condition
Till thou shalt reach thy home;
Trust, till in perfect fruition
That which is real hath come.

Who can cheer the heart like Jesus
By His presence all divine
True and tender, pure and precious
O, how blest to call Him mine
All that thrills my soul is Jesus
He is more than life to me
And the fairest of ten thousand
In my blessed Lord I see
Love of Christ so freely given
Grace of God beyond degree
Mercy higher than the heavens
Deeper than the deepest sea
What a wonderful redemption
Never can a mortal know
Ho my sin, though red like crimson
Can be whiter than the snow
Every need His hand supplying
Every good in Him I see
On His strength divine relying
He is all in all to me
By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King

All that’s good, and great, and true,
All that is and is to be,
Be it old or be it new,
Comes, O Father, comes from Thee.
Mercies dawn with every day,
Newer, brighter than before;
And the sun’s declining ray
Layeth others up in store.
Not a bird that doth not sing
Sweetest praises to Thy Name;
Not an insect on the wing
But Thy wonders doth proclaim.
Every blade and every tree
All in happy concert ring,
And in wondrous harmony
Join in praises to their King.
Fill us, then, with love divine;
Grant that we, though toiling here,
May in spirit, being Thine,
See and hear Thee everywhere.
May we all, with songs of praise,
Whilst on earth Thy Name adore,
Till with angel choirs we raise
Songs of praise forevermore.

All the day my heart is singing,
Not a throb of care I know,
For the Master’s feet have trodden
Every path He bids me go.
In the Lord is all my joy,
Blessed Savior, Friend divine!
Glad the songs my heart has known,
Since this Jesus has been mine.
Thro’ the night my heart keeps singing,
Sheltered in His secret place,
Midnight is as bright as noonday,
By the glory of His face.
When I reach that land of promise,
Sweeter strains my lips shall frame,
But the theme will still be Jesus,
Glory! glory! to His Name!

A shout of praise escapes my lips 
I feel my soul on fire 
And the loving touch 
I want so much 
Is trembling through my fingertips 
So I’ll praise all the days of my life 
For the Holy One 
The Righteous Son 
Has filled me up 
And set me free 
My mind is lost in awesome splendor 
A passion from within 
My hands I raise 
My God I praise 
For I am precious to my Savior 
So I’ll praise all the days of my life 
For the Holy One 
The Righteous Son 
Has filled me up 
And set me free

All the happy children, gladly join our song,
Rising to the Father, in a strong.
Birds are brightly singing, leaves are opening wide,
Flower bells are ringing forth on every side.
All the happy children, gladly join our song,
Rising to the Father, in a strong.
See the sky above us, spread so warm and blue,
So God’s love is reaching over me and you.
Father, dear we thank Thee for long summer days,
For the birds and flowers, for the grassy ways.
All the happy children thank Thee, Father dear,
For this day for children out of all the year.
We will still remember we are Thine alone;
He Who made the summer made us every one.

My God can never fail,
He's been proved time and again
Trust Him and see
He's got all the power you need
He's never early, never late
It takes courage, it takes faith
Trust Him and see
He's got all the power you need
He saves, forgives, and heals
Takes back what the devil steals
My debt's been paid in full
And every day He does miracles
I got dreams, turn them into plans
Too big for human hands
Trust Him and see
He's got all the power you need
He's real, He's real
Faith's a lot stronger than what you feel
He's real, He's real
I'm believing for miracles

All the sacrifice is ended,
Breathed His body’s latest breath,
And His human Soul hath wended
Where the weary rest beneath;
Christ as Man hath comprehended
All the human law of death!
Yet not there His Soul remaineth
Nor His body in the tomb:
Lo! what sudden glory gaineth
Quick dominion o’er the gloom!
Yea, o’er death and hell He reigneth
Bursting back the gates of doom!
Manifold the attestation
Brethren tell the marvel o’er,
And the soldiers from their station,
And the angels at the door,
And His own Word’s revelation,
“Lo! I live for evermore."
Hail, thou morn of resurrection,
Primal holy Easter Day!
Now the hours of deep dejection
’Neath the night-clouds’ dark array,
Foes’ reviling, friends’ defection,
In thy glory pass away!
Now He lives and reigns for ever!
That we too may enter in
Where eternal life shall never
Taste of sorrow or of sin,
Where from Him no death shall sever
Those He vanquished death to win.
Savior! in our night of weeping
Tell us of the joyful morn,
Guard our souls, their vigil keeping
In the hours of hate and scorn
Raise us falling, wake us sleeping,
Till our Easter Day be born.

Within my heart was fond ambition,
Vain pride, and hopes of worldly fame;
But still remained a place so vacant,
Unfilled by highest earthly aim.
Then Jesus reached His hand to help me—
“Come, seek My love," I heard Him say;
I quickly left the world behind me,
To follow Jesus all the way.
He led me through the verdant valleys,
Where flowers bloomed by waters fair;
The sunbeams glory showered o’er me,
And fragrant odors filled the air.
Then through the shadowed vale I followed,
Where entered not a brilliant ray;
I felt His touch, though could not see Him,
Then whispered softly, “All the way." 
And then the furnace door was opened:
Within its fiery walls enclosed,
The Son of God was still beside me,
Upon His bosom I reposed.
When in my heart He saw reflected
His image pure—as bright as day—
He led me forth with joy abounding;
Again I whispered, “All the way." 
I stood all ready for His service,
With gold refined and dross removed;
The flames had left my soul uninjured,
But they my faithfulness had proved.
In dismal night or brightest noonday,
If Thou wilt near me ever stay,
Where’er Thou leadest me, O Savior,
I’ll meekly follow all the way.

There is One Who loves me, One Who is my Friend.
All the way along, all the way along.
He is ever near me, ready to defend.
All the way along it is Jesus.
All the way along it is Jesus;
All the way along, blessed Jesus.
He’s my joy and song, all the way along.
All the way along it is Jesus.
He doth still the tempest, bid its tumult cease,
All the way along, all the way along.
In the time of trouble keeps in perfect peace;
All the way along it is Jesus.
In my Lord and Savior I will joyful be,
All the way along, all the way along.
Speaking words of comfort sweet and dear to me,
All the way along it is Jesus.
I will sing the praises of His wondrous love,
All the way along, all the way along.
I will sing more sweetly in my home above,
All the way along it is Jesus.

All the way my Savior leads me;
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my Guide?
Heav’nly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know, whate’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well;
For I know, whate’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.
All the way my Savior leads me,
Cheers each winding path I tread;
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living Bread.
Though my weary steps may falter,
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo! A spring of joy I see;
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo! A spring of joy I see.
All the way my Savior leads me
O the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father’s house above.
When my spirit, clothed immortal,
Wings its flight to realms of day
This my song through endless ages—
Jesus led me all the way;
This my song through endless ages—
Jesus led me all the way.

Take up the battle cry all along the line;
You shall gain the victory, victory divine,
With your Commander nigh, foes in vain combine;
Raise aloft the banner, let it bear the sign.
“All the world for Jesus," let the ring;
“All the world for Jesus," crown Him King;
“All the world for Jesus," let the watchword be
“Forward go in Jesus’ Name to victory."
Truth’s armor you may claim, faith will be your shield;
Fighting on in Jesus’ Name, mighty power you wield;
Glory for God your aim, naught can make you yield;
Shout aloud the triumph sure to be revealed.
Soldiers, with courage go, go forsaking all;
Onward, then, to meet the foe, soon the foe shall fall;
Send mighty blow on blow—let no fear appall;
In the Name of Jesus, sound afar the call.

All the world for Jesus!
Be this our earnest aim;
To spread the blessed tidings
Of Him Who once was slain.
All the world for Jesus,
Let ev’ry creature sing;
All the world for Jesus,
Our great eternal King.
All the world for Jesus!
Let each one pray and give,
Until remotest nations
Shall look to Him and live.
All the world for Jesus!
We’ll give, at His behest,
To raise the poor and helpless,
Till all have Christ confessed.
All the world for Jesus!
And Jesus for the world!
Forever be His banner
Of victory unfurled.

All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion’s mount,
By many ages proved.
Like the mount of God,
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion’s mount,
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion’s mount,
They can never be removed.
As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.
Tho’ fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe forevermore.
Thus overshadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne’er betide,
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide.

Almighty God my redeemer
My hiding place my safe refuge, no other name like Jesus
No power can stand against You.
My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not be shaken
My hope it comes from You alone
My Lord and my salvation
Your praise is always on my lips
Your word is living in my heart
And I will praise You with a new song, My soul will bless You Lord
You fill my life with greater joy
Yes I delight myself in You
And I will praise You with a new song, My soul will bless You, Lord
When I am weak, you make me strong
When I’m poor, I know I’m rich for in the power of Your name
All things are possible
All things are possible
All things are possible
All things are possible

All things are possible to them
That can in Jesu's name believe:
Lord, I no more thy truth blaspheme,
Thy truth I lovingly receive;
I can, I do believe in thee;
All things are possible to me.
The most impossible of all
Is that I e'er from sin should cease;
Yet shall it be, I know it shall:
Jesus, look to thy faithfulness!
If nothing is too hard for thee,
All things are possible to me.
Though earth and hell the word gainsay,
The word of God can never fail;
The Lamb shall take my sins away,
'Tis certain, though impossible;
The thing impossible shall be;
All things are possible to me.
All things are possible to God,
To Christ, the power of God in man,
To me, when I am all renewed,
When I in Christ am formed again,
And witness, from all sin set free,
All things are possible to me.

“All things are ready," come to the feast!
Come, for the table now is spread;
Ye famishing, ye weary, come,
And thou shalt be richly fed.
Hear the invitation,
Come, “whosoever will";
Praise God for full salvation
For “whosoever will."
“All things are ready," come to the feast!
Come, for the door is open wide;
A place of honor is reserved
For you at the Master’s side.
“All things are ready," come to the feast!
Come, while He waits to welcome thee;
Delay not while this day is thine,
Tomorrow may never be.
“All things are ready," come to the feast!
Leave ev’ry care and worldly strife;
Come, feast upon the love of God,
And drink everlasting life.

All things are Thine; no gift have we,
Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee:
And hence with grateful hearts today
Thine own before Thy feet we lay.
Thy will was in the builders’ thought;
Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
Through mortal motive, scheme and plan
Thy wise eternal purpose ran.
No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;
For human needs and longings grew
This house of prayer, this home of rest,
In the fair garden of the West.
In weakness and in want we call
On Thee for Whom the heavens are small;
Thy glory is Thy children’s good,
Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.
O Father, deign these walls to bless;
Fill with Thy love their emptiness;
And let their door a gateway be
To lead us from ourselves to Thee.

All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful:
The Lord God made them all.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings.
[Most hymnals omit the following verse]
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
He made them, high or lowly,
And ordered their estate.
The purple headed mountains,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky.
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
To gather every day.
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.

Friends all around me are trying to find
What the heart yearns for, by sin undermined;
I have the secret, I know where ’tis found:
Only true pleasures in Jesus abound.
All that I want is in Jesus.
He satisfies, joy He supplies;
Life would be worthless without Him;
All things in Jesus I find.
Some carry burdens whose weight has for years
Crushed them with sorrow and blinded with tears.
Yet One stands ready to help them just now,
If they will humbly in penitence bow.
No other name thrills the joy chords within,
And through none else is remission of sin.
He knows the pain of the heart sorely tried.
Both need and want will by Him be supplied.
Jesus is all this poor world needs today.
Blindly they strive, for sin darkens their way.
O to draw back the grim curtains of night,
One glimpse of Jesus and all will be bright!

All things praise Thee, Lord most high,
Heav’n and earth and sea and sky,
All were for Thy glory made,
That Thy greatness thus displayed
Should all worship bring to Thee;
All things praise Thee—Lord, may we!
All things praise Thee—night to night
Sings in silent hymns of light;
All things praise Thee—day to day
Chants Thy power in burning ray;
Time and space are praising Thee,
All things praise Thee—Lord, may we!
All things praise Thee—high and low,
Rain and dew and sparkling snow,
Crimson sunset, fleecy cloud,
Rippling stream, and tempest loud;
Summer, winter, all to Thee
Glory render—Lord, may we!
All things praise Thee—Heav’n’s high shrine
Rings with melody divine;
Lowly bending at Thy feet,
Seraph and archangel meet;
This their highest bliss, to be
Ever praising—Lord, may we!
All things praise Thee—gracious Lord,
Great Creator, powerful Word,
Omnipresent Spirit, now
At Thy feet we humbly bow;
Lift our hearts in praise to Thee;
All things praise Thee—Lord, may we!

All this night bright angels sing,
Never was such caroling,
Hark! a voice which loudly cries,
“Mortals, mortals, wake and rise."
Lo! to gladness turns your sadness:
From the earth is ris’n a Son,
Shines all night tho’ day be done."
Wake, O earth, wake ev’ry thing,
Wake and hear the joy I bring:
Wake and joy; for all this night,
Heav’n and ev’ry twinkling light,
All amazing, still stand gazing,
Angels, pow’rs and all that be,
Wake, and joy this Son to see.
Hail! O Son, O blessed Light,
Sent into this world by night;
Let Thy rays and heav’nly pow’rs,
Shine in these dark souls of ours.
For most duly, Thou art truly
God and Man, we do confess:
Hail, O Sun of Righteousness!

All those that pass by, to Jesus draw near,
He utters a cry, ye sinners, give ear!
From hell to retrieve you He spreads out His hands;
And now to receive you, He graciously stands.
If any man thirst, and happy would be,
The vilest and worst may come unto Me,
May drink of My Spirit, excepted is none,
Lay claim to My merit, and take for his own.
Whoever receives the life giving Word,
In Jesus believes, his God and his Lord,
In him a pure river of life shall arise,
Shall in the believer spring up to the skies.
My God and my Lord! Thy call I obey,
My soul on Thy word of promise I stay,
Thy kind invitation I gladly embrace,
Athirst for salvation, salvation by grace.
O hasten the hour! Send down from above
The Spirit of power, of health, and of love,
Of filial fear, of knowledge and grace,
Of wisdom and prayer, of joy and of praise.
The Spirit of faith, of faith in Thy blood,
Which saves us from wrath, and brings us to God,
Removes the huge mountain of indwelling sin,
And opens a fountain that washes us clean.

All to Jesus, I surrender;
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.
I surrender all, I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.
All to Jesus I surrender;
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
Take me, Jesus, take me now.
All to Jesus, I surrender;
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.
All to Jesus, I surrender;
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power;
Let Thy blessing fall on me.
All to Jesus I surrender;
Now I feel the sacred flame.
O the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory, to His Name!

Master designer, framer of the world
Lord of creation, high above the earth
With a word you spoke it, and all things came to be
Maker of the heavens, you’re all to me
All to me, all to me
You made it all
Be all to me
The earth declares your majesty
Jesus be my all in all
You walked on water, raised the dead to life
Taught us the Father, and proved you were the Light
Then you gave us something, no one else could give
Lamb of God: you suffered – so we could live
All to me, all to me
You gave your all
Be all to me
You bled and died on Calvary
Jesus be my all in all
Jesus be my all in all

He that believes and is baptized
shall see the Lord's salvation;
baptized into the death of Christ,
he is a new creation.
through Christ's redemption he shall stand
among the glorious heavenly band
of every tribe and nation.
With one accord, O God, we pray:
grant us thy Holy Spirit;
look thou on our infirmity
through Jesus' blood and merit.
Grant us to grow in grace each day
that by this sacrament we may
eternal life inherit.

All who love and serve your city,
all who bear its daily stress,
all who cry for peace and justice,
all who curse and all who bless,
In your day of loss and sorrow,
in your day of helpless strife,
honor, peace, and love retreating,
seek the Lord, who is your life.
In your day of wrath and plenty,
wasted work and wasted play,
call to mind the word of Jesus,
"I must work while it is day."
For all days are days of judgment,
and the Lord is waiting still,
drawing near a world that spurns him,
offering peace from Calvary's hill.
Risen Lord! shall yet the city 
be the city of despair?
Come today, our Judge, our Glory;
be its name, "The Lord is there!"

Only Thy presence, O Savior divine,
Only Thy Spirit to witness with mine;
Only Thine image of love on my breast,
Seal of forgiveness, assurance of rest.
What tho’ the billows like mountains may swell;
All will be well; yes, all will be well;
Under Thy shadow in peace I shall dwell;
All, all will be well.
Only Thy presence to lead me aright,
Out of the darkness and into the light;
Only a whisper to tell Thou art near,
Only Thy sunshine to banish my fear.
Only Thy presence when trials I bear,
Lifting so gently my burden of care;
Only Thy presence to show me the way,
Home to the mansions of infinite day.
Only Thy presence when wild is the gale,
Only Thy presence when rent is my sail;
Only Thy presence my vessel to guide
Into the harbor and over the tide.

All wise, all good, almighty Lord,
Jesus, by highest Heav’n adored,
Ere time its course began;
How did Thy glorious mercy stoop,
To take Thy fallen children up,
When Thou Thyself wert man?
Th’eternal God from Heav’n came down;
The King of glory dropped His crown
And veiled His majesty;
Emptied of all but love He came,
Jesus, I call Thee by the Name,
The pity bore for me.
O holy Child, still let Thy birth
Bring peace to us poor worms on earth,
And praise to God on high!
Come, Thou who didst my flesh assume;
Now to the abject sinner come,
And in a manger lie.
Didst Thou not in person join
The natures human and divine,
That God and man might be
Henceforth inseparably one?
Haste then and make Thy nature known
Incarnated in me.
In my weak, sinful flesh appear,
O God, be manifested here,
Peace, righteousness and joy;
Thy kingdom, Lord, set up within
My faithful heart; and all my sin,
The devil’s work, destroy.
I long Thy coming to confess,
The mystic power of godliness,
The life divine to prove:
The fulness of Thy life to know,
Redeemed from all my sins below,
And perfected in love.
O Christ, my Hope, make known to me
The great, the glorious mystery
The hidden life impart;
Come, Thou Desire of nations, come,
Formed in a spotless virgin’s womb,
A pure, believing heart.
Come quickly, dearest Lord, that I
May own, though antichrist deny,
Thy incarnation’s power:
May cry, a witness to my Lord,
“Come in my flesh is Christ the Word,
And I must sin no more!"

All ye Gentile lands awake!
Thou, O Salem, rise and shine!
See the day-spring o’er you break,
Heralding a morn divine,
Telling, God hath called to mind
Those who long in darkness pined.
Lo! the shadows flee away,
For our Light is come at length,
Brighter than all earthly day,
Source of being, life and strength!
Whoso on this Light would gaze
Must forsake all evil ways.
Ah how blindly did we stray
Ere shone forth this glorious Sun,
Seeking each his separate way,
Leaving Heaven, unsought, unwon;
All our looks were earthward bent,
All our strength on earth was spent.
Earthly were our thoughts and low,
In the toils of folly caught,
Tossed of Satan to and fro,
Counting goodness all for naught;
By the world and flesh deceived,
Heaven’s true joys we disbelieved.
Then were hidden from our eyes
All the law and grace of God;
Rich and poor, the fools and wise,
Wanting light to find the road
Leading to the heavenly life,
Wandered lost in care and strife.
But the glory of the Lord
Hath arisen on us today;
We have seen the light outpoured
That must surely drive away
All things that to night belong,
All the sad earth’s woe and wrong.
Thy arising, Lord, shall fill
All my thoughts in sorrow’s hour;
Thy arising, Lord, shall still
All my dread of death’s dark power;
Through my smiles and through my tears
Still Thy light, O Lord, appears.
Let me, Lord in peace depart
From this evil world to Thee;
Where Thyself sole Brightness art,
Thou hast kept a place for me:
In the shining city there
Crowns of light Thy saints shall wear.

All ye that fear God’s holy Name,
His glory tell, His praise proclaim;
Ye children of His chosen race,
Stand ye in awe before His face,
Stand ye in awe before His face.
The suffering one He has not spurned
Who unto Him for succor turned;
From him He has not hid His face
But answered his request in grace,
But answered his request in grace.
O Lord, Thy goodness makes me raise
Amid Thy people songs of praise;
Before all them that fear Thee, now
I worship Thee and pay my vow,
I worship Thee and pay my vow.
For all the meek Thou wilt provide,
They shall be fed and satisfied;
All they that seek the Lord shall live
And never ending praises give,
And never ending praises give.

All ye that love the Lord, rejoice,
And let your songs be new;
Amidst the church with cheerful voice
His later wonders show.
The Jews, the people of His grace,
Shall their Redeemer sing;
And Gentile nations join the praise,
While Sion owns her King.
The Lord takes pleasure in the just,
Whom sinners treat with scorn;
The meek that lie despised in dust
Salvation shall adorn.
Saints should be joyful in their King,
E’en on a dying bed;
And like the souls in glory sing;
For God shall raise the dead.
Then His high praise shall fill their tongues
Their hands shall wield the sword;
And vengeance shall attend their songs,
The vengeance of the Lord.
When Christ the judgment-seat ascends,
And bids the world appear,
Thrones are prepared for all His friends
Who humbly loved Him here.
Then shall they rule with iron rod
Nations that dared rebel;
And join the sentence of their God
On tyrants doomed to hell.
The royal sinners bound in chains
New triumphs shall afford:
Such honor for the saints remains:
Praise ye, and love the Lord!

All ye that pass by,
To Jesus draw nigh:
To you is it nothing that Jesus should die?
Your ransom and peace,
Your surety He is:
Come, see if there ever was sorrow like His.
For what you have done
His blood must atone:
The Father hath punished for you His dear Son.
The Lord, in the day
Of His anger, did lay
Your sins on the Lamb, and He bore them away.
He answered for all:
O come at His call,
And low at His cross with astonishment fall!
But lift up your eyes
At Jesus’ cries:
Impassive, He suffers; immortal, He dies.
He dies to atone
For sins not His own;
Your debt He hath paid, and your work He hath done.
Ye all may receive
The peace He did leave,
Who made intercession, “My Father, forgive!"
For you and for me
He prayed on the tree:
The prayer is accepted, the sinner is free.
That sinner am I,
Who on Jesus rely,
And come for the pardon God cannot deny.
My pardon I claim;
For a sinner I am,
A sinner believing in Jesus’ Name.
He purchased the grace
Which now I embrace:
O Father, Thou know’st He hath died in my place.
His death is my plea;
My Advocate see,
And hear the blood speak that hath answered for me.
My ransom He was
When He bled on the cross;
And losing His life He hath carried my cause.

All ye who seek for sure relief
In trouble and distress,
Whatever sorrows vex the mind,
Or guilt the soul oppress,
Jesus, Who gave Himself for you
Upon the cross to die,
Opens to you His sacred heart;
O to that heart draw nigh.
Ye hear how kindly He invites;
Ye hear His words so blest;
“All ye that labor come to me,
And I will give you rest."
O Jesus, Joy of saints on high,
Thou Hope of sinners here,
Attracted by those loving words
To Thee we lift our prayer.
Wash Thou our wounds in that dear blood
Which from Thy heart doth flow;
A new and contrite heart on all
Who cry to Thee bestow.

All that's good, and all that's right
All that's beautiful in life
All that's pure, and all that's true
It all begins and ends in You
And every star in the sky
Joins in thanks, and we reply
For all You are, and all You've been
We say thank you once again
For all You are, and all You'll be
We will worship endlessly
For all You are

Is there a heart o'er-bound by sorrow?
Is there a life weighed down by care?
Come to the cross--each burden bearing,
All your anxiety--leave it there.
All your anxiety, all your care,
Bring to the mercy seat--leave it there;
Never a burden He cannot bear,
Never a friend like Jesus.
No other friend so keen to help you,
No other friend so quick to hear;
No other place to leave your burden,
No other one to hear your prayer.
Come then at once--delay no longer!
Heed His entreaty kind and sweet;
You need not fear a disappointment--
You shall find peace at the mercy seat.

O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your Name
Your words are true, your mercy does not change
All your promises are precious, reviving our faith
Ev’ry one of them will be fulfilled one day
Oh all your promises are
Yes and Amen, Jesus
Your promises are true
All your promises are Yes and Amen
Lord Jesus
We’ll keep running after you
We will run, we’ll run and not grow weary
We will rise up on the eagle’s wings
In the presence of the Lord our spirits will soar
‘till we one day gaze upon our King
My foot had almost slipped
Oh Lord I’d almost lost my way
Till I entered the house of the Lord
And I heard your sweet Spirit say

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia! 
He’s my Savior!
He’s my Savior!
He’s my Savior!
He is Worthy!
He is Worthy!
He is Worthy!
I will Praise Him!
I will Praise Him!
I will Praise Him!

Alleluia, Alleluia,
hearts to heaven and voices raise;
sing to God a hymn of gladness,
sing to God a hymn of praise:
he who on the Cross a victim
for the world's salvation bled,
Jesus Christ, the King of Glory,
now is risen from the dead.
Christ is risen, Christ the first-fruits
of the holy harvest field,
which will all its full abundance
at his second coming yield;
then the golden ears of harvest
will their heads before him wave,
ripened by his glorious sunshine,
from the furrows of the grave.
Christ is risen, we are risen;
shed upon us heavenly grace,
rain, and dew, and gleams of glory
from the brightness of thy face;
that we, with our hearts in heaven,
here on earth may fruitful be,
and by angel-hands be gathered,
and be ever, Lord, with thee.
Alleluia, Alleluia,
glory be to God on high;
Alleluia to the Saviour,
who has gained the victory;
Alleluia to the Spirit,
fount of love and sanctity;
Alleluia, Alleluia,
to the Triune Majesty.

Alleluia, fairest morning,
Fairer than our words can say!
Down we lay the heavy burden
Of life’s toil and care today,
While this morn of joy and love
Brings fresh vigor from above.
Sunday full of holy glory,
Sweetest rest-day of the soul!
Light upon a world of darkness
From thy blessed moments roll!
Holy, happy, heav’nly day,
Thou canst charm our grief away.
In the gladness of His worship
We will seek our joy today;
It is then we learn the fullness
Of the grace for which we pray,
When the word of life is giv’n,
Like the Savior’s voice from Heav’n.
Let the day with Thee be ended,
As with Thee it has begun,
And Thy blessing, Lord, be granted,
Till earth’s days and weeks are done;
That at last Thy servants may
Keep eternal Sabbath day.

Alleluia, alleluia, Lord my God
Alleluia, alleluia, Lord my God
I will praise your Holy name
As long as I have life and breath
I will tell how You were raised
Over the power of death
I will bow down at Your feet
Waiting to know Your holy will
I will rest and be complete
For You said "Peace be still"

Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter, His the throne.
Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone.
Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood.
Jesus out of every nation has redeemed us by His blood.
Alleluia! not as orphans are we left in sorrow now;
Alleluia! He is near us, faith believes, nor questions how;
Though the cloud from sight received Him when the forty days were o’er
Shall our hearts forget His promise, “I am with you evermore"?
Alleluia! bread of angels, Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Alleluia! here the sinful flee to Thee from day to day:
Intercessor, Friend of sinners, Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,
Where the songs of all the sinless sweep across the crystal sea.
Alleluia! King eternal, Thee the Lord of lords we own;
Alleluia! born of Mary, Earth Thy footstool, Heav’n Thy throne:
Thou within the veil hast entered, robed in flesh our great High Priest;
Thou on earth both priest and victim in the Eucharistic feast.

Alleluia, song of gladness,
Voice of joy that cannot die;
Alleluia is the anthem
Ever dear to choirs on high;
In the house of God abiding
Thus they sing eternally.
Alleluia thou resoundest,
True Jerusalem and free;
Alleluia, joyful mother,
All thy children sing with thee;
But by Babylon’s sad waters
Mourning exiles now are we.
Alleluia we deserve not
Here to chant forevermore;
Alleluia our transgressions
Make us for a while give o’er;
For the holy time is coming
Bidding us our sins deplore.
Therefore in our hymns we pray Thee,
Grant us, blessed Trinity,
At the last to keep Thine Easter
In our home beyond the sky;
There to Thee forever singing
Alleluia joyfully.

Alleluia, song of sweetness,
voice of joy that cannot die;
alleluia is the anthem
ever raised by choirs on high;
in the house of God abiding
thus they sing eternally.
Alleluia thou resoundest,
true Jerusalem and free;
alleluia, joyful mother,
all thy children sing with thee;
but by Babylon's sad waters
mourning exiles now are we.
Alleluia cannot always
be our song while here below;
alleluia our transgressions
make us for awhile forgo;
fort the solemn time is coming
when our tears for sin must flow.
Therefore in our hymns we pray thee,
grant us, blessed Trinity,
at the last to keep thine Easter,
in our home beyond the sky,
there to thee for ever singing
alleluia joyfully.

Almighty, most Holy God
Faithful through the ages
Almighty, most Holy God
Glorious, Almighty God
The beasts of the field, the birds of the air
Are silent to call out Your Name
The earth has no voice and I have no choice
But to magnify God unashamed
Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day
Let the whole world sing out, let the people say
Well time marches on, with the innocence gone,
And a darkness has covered the earth
But His Spirit dwells, He speaks, "it is well,"
And the hopeless still offered new birth
He will break the leash of death, it will have no sting
Let the prisoner go free, join the dance and sing 

Almighty Father, hear our cry,
As o’er the trackless deep we roam;
Be Thou our haven always nigh,
On homeless waters Thou our home.
O Jesu, Savior, at Whose voice
The tempest sank to perfect rest,
Bid Thou the fearful heart rejoice,
And cleanse and calm the troubled breast.
O Holy Ghost, beneath Whose power
The ocean woke to life and light,
Command Thy blessing in this hour,
Thy fostering warmth, Thy quickening might.
Great God of our salvation, Thee
We love, we worship, we adore;
Our Refuge on time’s changeful sea,
Our Joy on Heav’n’s eternal shore.

Almighty Father, Lord most high,
Who madest all, Who fillest all,
Thy Name we praise and magnify,
For all our needs on Thee we call.
We offer to Thee of Thine own
Ourselves and all that we can bring,
In bread and cup before Thee shown,
Our universal offering.
All that we have we bring to Thee,
Yet all is naught when all is done,
Save that in it Thy love can see
The sacrifice of Thy dear Son.
By His command in bread and cup
His body and His blood we plead;
What on the cross He offered up
Is here our sacrifice indeed.
For all Thy gifts of life and grace,
Here we Thy servants humbly pray
That Thou wouldst look upon the face
Of Thine anointed Son today.

Almighty Father of mankind,
On Thee our hopes remain;
And when the day of trouble comes
I shall not trust in vain.
In early years Thou wast my Guide,
And of my youth the Friend;
And as my days began with Thee,
With Thee my days shall end.
I know the Power in Whom I trust,
The arm on which I lean;
He will my Savior ever be
Who has my Savior been.
My God, Who causedst me to hope
When life began to beat,
And, when a stranger in the world,
Didst guide my wandering feet.
Thou wilt not cast me off when age
And evil days descend;
Thou wilt not leave me in despair
To mourn my latter end.
Therefore in life I’ll trust in Thee,
In death I will adore;
And after death will sing Thy praise
When time shall be no more.

Almighty Father, Unoriginate,
Whom no man hath seen ever, nor can see;
Who reignest blest and only Potentate,
Light unapproachable encircling Thee:
Almighty Father, hallowed be Thy Name;
Who ever art, unchangeably the same.
Thou lovest us, else had we never been:
Before we were, in ages long ago,
Thy love had us and all our wants foreseen,
Creating us that we Thy love might know,
Yea, Father, Thou, in Whom we live and move,
Hast loved us with an everlasting love.
Thou madest man immortal at the first,
An image of Thine own eternity;
And when he fell from life, through sin accursed,
And lost his right to the life giving tree,
Thy love, unconquered would to him restore
His life ennobled and forevermore.
Such was Thy love, Thou didst not even spare
Thy Best-beloved, but gav’st Him for us all;
To live that human life beyond compare,
And dying, by His death retrieve our fall.
In Him Thy love unbounded we behold,
For, giving Him, Thou canst not aught withhold.
Thou knowest what we are, how frail and blind,
Thou still rememb’rest that we are but dust:
Like as a father pitieth, Thou art kind,
Thy justice kindness, and Thy kindness just.
Then hear Thy children’s prayer from Heav’n Thy throne;
Father, Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done.

Almighty Father, Who dost give
The gift of life to all who live,
Look down on all earth’s sin and strife,
And lift us to a nobler life.
Lift up our hearts, O King of kings,
To brighter hopes and kindlier things;
To visions of a larger good,
And holier dreams of brotherhood.
Thy world is weary of its pain;
Of selfish greed and fruitless gain;
Of tarnished honor, falsely strong,
And all its ancient deeds of wrong.
Hear Thou the prayer Thy servants pray,
Uprising from all lands today,
And o’er the vanquished powers of sin,
O bring Thy great salvation in.

Almighty Lord, with one accord
We offer Thee our youth,
And pray that Thou would’st give us
The warfare of the truth.
Thy cause doth claim our souls by name,
Because that we are strong;
In all the land, one steadfast band,
May we to Christ belong.
Let fall on every college hall
The luster of Thy cross,
That love may dare Thy work to share
And count all else as loss.
Our hearts be ruled, our spirits schooled
Alone Thy will to seek;
And when we find Thy blessed mind,
Instruct our lips to speak.

Almighty God, Thy lofty throne
Has justice for its cornerstone,
And shining bright before Thy face
Are truth and love and boundless grace.
With blessing is the nation crowned
Whose people know the joyful sound;
They in the light, O Lord, shall live,
The light Thy face and favor give.
Thy Name with gladness they confess,
Exalted in Thy righteousness;
Their fame and might to Thee belong,
For in Thy favor they are strong.
All glory unto God we yield,
Jehovah is our Help and Shield;
All praise and honor will we bring
To Israel’s Holy One, our King.

Almighty God, Who from the flood
Didst bring to light a twofold brood;
Part in the firmament to fly,
And part in ocean’s depths to lie;
Appointing fishes in the sea,
And fowls in open air to be,
That each, by origin the same,
Its separate dwelling place might claim:
Grant that Thy servants, by the tide
Of blood and water purified,
No guilty fall from Thee may know,
Nor death eternal undergo.
Be none submerged in sin’s distress,
None lifted up in boastfulness;
That contrite hearts be not dismayed,
Nor naughty souls in ruin laid.
O Father, that we ask be done,
Through Jesus Christ Thine only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.

Almighty God, Whose only Son
O’er sin and death the triumph won,
And ever lives to intercede
For souls who Thy sweet mercy need;
In His dear Name to Thee we pray
For all who err and go astray,
For sinners, wheresoe’er they be,
Who do not serve and honor Thee.
There are who never yet have heard
The tidings of Thy blessed Word,
But still in heathen darkness dwell,
Without one thought of Heav’n or hell.
And some within Thy sacred fold
To holy things are dead and cold,
And waste the precious hours of life
In selfish ease, or toil, or strife;
And many a quickened soul within
There lurks the secret love of sin,
A wayward will, or anxious fears,
Or lingering taint of bygone years.
O give repentance true and deep
To all Thy lost and wandering sheep,
And kindle in their hearts the fire
Of holy love and pure desire.
That so from angel hosts above
May rise a sweeter song of love,
And we, with all the blest, adore
Thy Name, O God, for evermore.

Almighty God, Your Word is cast
Like seed into the ground;
Now let the dew of Heav’n descend,
And righteous fruits abound.
Let not the foe of Christ and man
This holy seed remove,
But give it root in ev’ry heart
To bring forth fruits of love.
Let not the world’s deceitful cares
The rising plant destroy.
But let it yield a hundredfold
The fruits of peace and joy.
Nor let Your Word so kindly sent
To raise us to Your throne
Return to You, and sadly tell
That we reject Your Son.
Oft as the precious seed is sown,
Your quick’ning grace bestow,
That all whose souls the truth receive,
Its saving power may know.
Great God, come down and on Your Word
Your mighty power bestow,
That all who hear the joyful sound,
Your saving grace may know.

Almighty Lord, with one accord
We offer Thee our youth,
And pray that Thou would’st give us
The warfare of the truth.
Thy cause doth claim our souls by name,
Because that we are strong;
In all the land, one steadfast band,
May we to Christ belong.
Let fall on every college hall
The luster of Thy cross,
That love may dare Thy work to share
And count all else as loss.
Our hearts be ruled, our spirits schooled
Alone Thy will to seek;
And when we find Thy blessed mind,
Instruct our lips to speak.

Almighty Maker of my frame!
Teach me the measure of my days,
Teach me to know how frail I am,
And spend the remnant in Thy praise.
My days are shorter than a span,
A little point my life appears;
How frail at best is dying man!
How vain are all his hopes and fears!
Vain his ambition, noise and show;
Vain are the cares which rack his mind;
He heaps up treasures mixed with woe,
And dies and leaves them all behind.
O be a nobler portion mine!
My God, I bow before Thy throne;
Earth’s fleeting treasures I resign,
And fix my hope on Thee alone.

Almighty Ruler of the skies,
Thro’ the wide earth Thy Name is spread;
And Thine eternal glories rise
O’er all the heav’ns Thy hands have made.
To Thee the voices of the young
A monument of honor raise;
And babes, with uninstructed tongue,
Declare the wonders of Thy praise.
Thy power assists their tender age
To bring proud rebels to the ground,
To still the bold blasphemer’s rage,
And all their policies confound.
Children amidst Thy temple throng
To see their great Redeemer’s face;
The Son of David is their song,
And young hosannas fill the place.
The frowning scribes and angry priests
In vain their impious cavils bring;
Revenge sits silent in their hearts;
While Jewish babes proclaim their King.

Almighty Spirit, now behold
A world by sin destroyed:
Creating Spirit, as of old,
Move on the formless void,
Move on the formless void.
Give Thou the Word: that healing sound
Shall quell the deadly strife;
And earth again, like Eden crowned,
Bring forth the tree of life,
Bring forth the tree of life.
If sang the morning stars for joy,
When nature rose to view,
What strains will angel harps employ,
When Thou shalt all renew,
When Thou shalt all renew!
And if the sons of God rejoice
To hear a Savior’s Name,
How will the ransomed raise their voice
To whom that Savior came,
To whom that Savior came!
Lo, every kindred, every tribe,
Assembling round the throne,
The new creation shall ascribe
To sovereign love alone,
To sovereign love alone!

Almost, but still I resisted,
Almost but never believed;
Almost, but waited and waited,
Till the sweet Spirit was grieved.
Now is the time to receive Him,
Now is the time to be saved;
Now, while the Spirit is pleading,
Now, Jesus waiteth to save.
Almost at one time I yielded,
Almost at one time was saved;
Almost, but drifted and drifted,
Satan thus held me enslaved.
Almost, why longer refuse Him?
Almost, O lost one, believe;
Almost, swing open thy heart’s door,
Jesus the Savior receive.

“Almost persuaded" now to believe;
“Almost persuaded" Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,
“Go, Spirit, go Thy way,
Some more convenient day
On Thee I’ll call."
“Almost persuaded," come, come today;
“Almost persuaded," turn not away;
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are lingering near
Prayers rise from hearts so dear;
O wanderer, come!
“Almost persuaded," harvest is past!
“Almost persuaded," doom comes at last!
“Almost" cannot avail;
“Almost" is but to fail!
Sad, sad, that bitter wail—
“Almost," but lost!

It was alone the Savior prayed
In dark Gethsemane;
Alone He drained the bitter cup
And suffered there for me.
Alone, alone, He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.
It was alone the Savior stood
In Pilate’s judgment hall;
Alone the crown of thorns He wore
Forsaken thus by all.
Alone upon the cross He hung
That others He might save;
Forsaken then by God and man
Alone, His life He gave.
Can you reject such matchless love?
Can you His claim disown?
Come, give your all in gratitude,
Nor leave Him thus alone.

Alone we stand within 
the world, 
A light of truth and love.
Though tempted by our scheming foe, 
We seek our God above.
Through Him we find the strength to stand,
Against the forceful tide.
While Christ the King, our light of Hope, 
Adds triumph to our side! 
The Devil shoots his fiery darts, 
And hopes that we might fall.
But standing firm, we call on God, 
The reigning king of all.
The name of Christ is etched in stone, 
Upon our hearts of flesh.
As day by day the Lord draws near, 
We feel our souls refreshed.

When storms of life are round me beating,
When rough the path that I have trod,
Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.
Alone with God, the world forbidden,
Alone with God, O blest retreat!
Alone with God, and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him communion sweet.
What tho’ the clouds have gathered o’er me?
What tho’ I’ve passed beneath the rod?
God’s perfect will there lies before me,
When I am thus alone with God.
’Tis there I find new strength for duty,
As o’er the sands of time I plod;
I see the King in all His beauty,
While resting there alone with God.
And when I see the moment nearing
When I shall sleep beneath the sod,
When time with me is disappearing,
I want to be alone with God.

Alone with none but thee, my God,
I journey on my way.
What need I fear when thou art near,
O King of night and day?
More safe am I within thy hand
than if a host should round me stand.
My destined time is known to thee,
and death will keep his hour;
did warriors strong around me throng,
they could not stay his power:
no walls of stone can man defend
when thou thy messenger dost send.
My life I yield to thy decree,
and bow to thy control
in peaceful calm, for from thine arm
no power can wrest my soul.
Could earthly omens e'er appal
a man that heeds the heavenly call?
The child of God can fear no ill,
his chosen dread no foe;
we leave our fate with thee, and wait
thy bidding when to go.
'Tis not from chance our comfort springs.
thou art our trust, O King of kings.

“Pilgrim, whither journey you
Along the path of life?
What’s the goal you have in view
Along the path of life?"
“Far beyond our vision, friend,
Is my journey’s blessed end;
Heavenward my footsteps wend
Along the path of life."
“Pilgrim, why not halt and rest
Along the path of life?
Quickly on your way you’ve pressed
Along the path of life."
“Nay, but through His precious grace
Soon I’ll end this earthly race;
I have no abiding place
Along the path of life."
“Pilgrim, why look you so glad
Along the path of life?"
“Nearing home, should I be sad
Along the path of life?
Where yon crystal towers shine
I shall see my King divine,
And eternal bliss be mine
Beyond this path of life."

Along the silent path
By viewless spirits trod,
Another little traveler
Hath gone to be with God.
Bid us, O Lord, to go,
Or bid us here to stay;
We’ll walk with Thee while here below,
Or up the silent way.
Gone up from human love
To higher love and care;
From pain below to peace above,
In mansions, oh, so fair! 
Attune our hearts, O Lord,
Though they with sorrow swell,
To say this meek, submissive word—
“Thou doest all things well."

Alpha, Omega, beginning and end,
Who is, Who was, and Who is yet to come—
May grace and peace now upon us descend
From Father, Spirit, and Christ the Son.
Lord Jesus Christ, First and Last, faithful e’er,
Once You were dead; now You live evermore.
The keys to death and to hell You now bear.
You rule the kings of earth by Your power.
To Him Who loves us and shed His own blood—
All of our sins in His body He bore,
Made us a kingdom and priests serving God—
To Him be glory, pow’r evermore!
Look, He is coming! With clouds He’s adorned.
All eyes will see Him when He comes again.
Because of Him, all earth’s peoples will mourn.
So shall it be! Amen and amen.

Always and ever, God reigns eternal,
Ceaseless, unchanging, Ancient of Days.
From choirs below and angels supernal
Alpha-Omega hears endless praise.
In the beginning, ere the first star birth,
There was the Father, Spirit and Son.
Maker, Creator, Heaven and earth
Sprang from His will—the plan was begun.
Down through the ages, secrets unlocking,
To save a people fettered with sin,
He sent the Word.He’s tenderly knocking:
Open your heart and let Him come in.
Always and ever, you can be with Him
In paradise, there no more to grieve.
Praising forever, Savior and Sovereign
Through endless ages—only believe!

Always enough of grace is giv’n to me from day to day,
Always enough of grace to help me on the upward way.
Always enough for me (for me),
Always enough for me (for me),
This is my song, the whole day long,
There’s always enough for me.
Always enough of comfort to console me when I’m sad,
Always enough of peace in time of storm to make me glad.
Always enough of Jesus’ love to fill me with delight,
Always enough of hope to keep faith’s altar burning bright.
Always enough of joy to make my heart rejoice and sing,
Always enough of pleasure in the service of my King.

Always with us, always with us,
Words of cheer, and words of love;
Thus the risen Savior whispers,
From His dwelling place above.
With us when we toil in sadness,
Sowing much, and reaping none;
Telling us that in the future
Golden harvests shall be won.
With us when the storm is sweeping,
O’er our pathway dark and drear;
Waking hope within our bosoms,
Stilling every anxious fear.
With us in the lonely valley,
When we cross the chilling stream;
Lighting up the steps to glory
With salvation’s radiant beam.

All In My Favor
You Made me Worthy;

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His Name?
Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?
Sure I must fight if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord.
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word.
Thy saints in all this glorious war
Shall conquer, though they die;
They see the triumph from afar,
By faith’s discerning eye
When that illustrious day shall rise,
And all Thy armies shine
In robes of victory through skies,
The glory shall be Thine.

I know there is a God who watches, who watches me
When I'm so alone
He promised a kingdom there to dwell forever, forever eternal
If I do His will I'll be in that number 
Am I worthy of the blessings that (my) Christ has spread on me
In times of danger so dark I could not see
I can feel His love inside my soul
I want to know dear Lord am I worthy, worthy? 
Trials and tribulations (trials and tribulations), pain, pain and strife
They are a part (they are a part) of this life
If I follow His, His footsteps they will guide to that light
The way that is right 
Spoken:
Thank you Lord for always being there for me.Even though I did my own thing at 
times, didn't look for you first.But you've always been there, stayed around 
and watched over me.Dear Father, am I worthy? 
If I do His will I'll be in that number 
Keep me in your care
When I stumble I know that you'll be there
I just want to be in that number 
Am I worthy of the blessings that (my) Christ has spread on me
In times of danger so dark I could not see 

Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!

Was blind, but now I see.

And Grace my fears relieved.

The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.
The Lord has promised good to me.
His Word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.

Amazing love,
How can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
Amazing love,
I know it’s true.
It’s my joy to honour You,
In all I do, I honour You.

God, the offended God most high,
Ambassadors to rebels sends;
His messengers His place supply,
And Jesus begs us to be friends.
Us, in the stead of Christ, they pray,
Us, in the stead of God, entreat,
To cast our arms, our sins, away,
And find forgiveness at His feet.
Our God in Christ! Thine embassy,
And proffered mercy, we embrace;
And gladly reconciled to Thee,
Thy condescending goodness praise.
Poor debtors, by our Lord’s request
A full acquittance we receive!
And criminals, with pardon blessed,
We, at our Judge’s instance, live!

Amen, Oh Lawdy !
Amen.Have mercy

Sing it over now

See the little baby
Lying in a manger
On Christmas morning

See Him in a temple
Talking to the elders
How are they marvelled

Healing all the sick ones

See Him at the garden
Praying to the father
In deepest sorrow

See Him on the cross 
Bearing all my sins
In bitter agony

He leads me day by day
He feeds me when I’m hungry
And hears me when I pray
John on the Isle of Patmos
Looked over inn the Glory –landHe heard the angels singing
And shouting Hallelujah! Amen
I would not be a deceiver
I’ll tell you the reason why
I’m afraid my Lord might call me
And I wouldn’t be ready to die
When I was a sinner
A sinner just like you
I came to the Lord in repentance
I believed till I came thro’
Sometimes my way is clouded
My pathway all confused
I set my face toward heaven
Determined to go thro’

My country 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing:
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the pilgrim's pride,
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring!
My native country, thee,
Land of the noble, free,
Thy name I love:
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with raptured thrills
Like that above.
Let music swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song:
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence break,
The sound prolong.
Our fathers' God, to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To the we sing:
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King!

O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good
With brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!
O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stem impassioned - stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God mend thine every flaw,
Confirm thy soul
In self-control,
Thy liberty in law!
O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife.
Who more than self the country loved
And mercy more than life!
America! America!
May God thy gold refine
Till all success
Be nobleness
And every gain divine!
O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good
With brotherhood
From sea to shining sea! 
O beautiful for halcyon skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the enameled plain!

God shed his grace on thee
Till souls wax fair
As earth and air
And music-hearted sea!
O beautiful for pilgrims feet,
Whose stem impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America ! America !

Of liberating strife
When once and twice, for man's avail
Men lavished precious life !

No longer stain
The banner of the free!

Amid the splendors of Thy state,
My God, Thy love appears
With the soft radiance of the moon
Among a thousand stars.
Nature through all her ample round
Thy boundless power proclaims,
And in melodious accent, speaks
The goodness of Thy names.
Thy justice, holiness, and truth,
Our solemn awe excite;
But the sweet charms of sovereign grace
O’erwhelm us with delight.
Sinai, in clouds, and smoke, and fire,
Thunders Thy dreadful Name;
But Sion sings, in melting notes,
The honors of the Lamb.
In all Thy doctrine and commands,
Thy counsels and designs,
In every work Thy hands have framed,
Thy love supremely shines.
Angels and men the news proclaim,
Through earth and Heaven above,
The joyful and transporting news,
That God the Lord is love!

Amid the thronging worshippers
Jehovah will I bless,
Before my brethren, gathered there,
His Name I will confess.
Come, praise Him, ye that fear the Lord,
Ye children of His grace,
With reverence sound His glories forth
And bow before His face.
The burden of the sorrowful
The Lord will not despise;
He has not turned from those that mourn,
He hearkens to their cries.
His goodness makes me join the throng
Where saints His praise proclaim,
And there will I fulfill my vows
’Mid those who fear His Name.
He feeds with good the humble soul
And satisfies the meek,
And they shall live and praise the Lord
Who for His mercy seek.
The ends of all the earth take thought,
The nations seek the Lord;
They worship Him, the King of kings,
In earth and Heav’n adored.

Amidst us our Beloved stands,
And bids us view His pierced hands;
Points to the wounded feet and side,
Blest emblems of the Crucified.
What food luxurious loads the board,
When at His table sits the Lord!
The wine how rich, the bread how sweet,
When Jesus deigns the guests to meet!
If now, with eyes defiled and dim,
We see the signs, but see not Him;
O may His love the scales displace,
And bid us see Him face to face!
O glorious Bridegroom of our hearts,
Your present smile a heav’n imparts!
O lift the veil, if veil there be,
Let every saint Your glory see!

An Alien from God, and a Stranger to Grace
I wandered through earth its gay pleasures to trace;
In the pathway of sin I continued to roam,
Unmindful, alas! That it led me from home.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.
O Savior, direct me to heaven my home.
The pleasures of earth I have seen fade away.
They bloom for a season, but soon they decay;
But pleasures more lasting in Jesus are giv'n,
Salvation on earth and a mansion in heav'n.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.
The saints in those mansions are ever at home.
Allure me no longer, ye false glowing charms
The Savior invites me, I'll go to His arms;
At the banquet of mercy I hear there is room,
O there may I feast with His children at home.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.
O Jesus, conduct me to heaven my home.
4, Farewell, vain amusements, my follies adieu, 
While Jesus, and heaven, and glory I view,
I feast on the pleasures that flow from His throne.
The footstool of heaven, sweet heaven, my home.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.
O when shall I share the fruition of home.
The days of my exile are passing away,
The time is approaching when Jesus will say,
"Well done, faithful servant, sit down on my throne,
And dwell in my presence forever at home.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.
O there I shall rest with the Savior at home.
Affliction and sorrow, and death shall be o'er;
The saints shall unite to be parted no more;
Their loud hallelujahs fill heaven's high dome.
They dwell with the Savior forever at home.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.
They dwell with the Savior forever at home.

An army of youth 
Flying the standards of truth, 
We're fighting for Christ, the Lord.
Heads lifted high, 
Catholic Action our cry, 
And the Cross our only sword.
On earth's battlefield 
Never a vantage we'll yield.
As dauntlessly on we swing
Comrades true, dare and do 
'Neath the Queen's white and blue,
For our flag, for our faith, 
For Christ the King.
Christ lifts His hands, 
The King commands; challenge, 'Come and follow me.'
From ev'ry side, 
With eager stride, 
We form in the lines of victory.
Let foemen lurk, 
And laggards shirk, 
We throw our fortunes to the Lord
Mary's Son, 
Till the world is won, 
WE have pledged you our loyal word.
'An army of youth'
[Daniel Lord, S.J.The Queens Work, St.Louis, MO, 1932]

Have you read the story of the cross
Where Jesus bled and died;
When your debt was paid by the precious blood
That flowed from His wounded side?
He died an atoning death for thee,
He died an atoning death;
O wondrous love! it was for thee
He died an atoning death!
Have you read how they placed the crown of thorns
Upon His kingly brow?
How He cried: "Forgive them, O forgive,
They know not what they do."
Have you read how the dying thief was saved
While hanging on the tree?
When he looked with pleading eyes and said,
"Dear Lord, remember me."
Have you read that He looked to heav'n and said:
"'Tis finished"— 'twas for thee?
Have you ever said: "I thank Thee, Lord,
For giving Thy life for me"?

An awe-full mystery is here
To challenge faith and waken fear:
The Savior comes as food divine,
Concealed in earthly bread and wine.
This world is loveless—but above
What wondrous boundlessness of love!
The King of Glory stoops to me
My spirit’s life and strength to be.
In consecrated wine and bread
No eye perceives the mystery dread;
But Jesus’ words are strong and clear;
“My body and My blood are here."
How dull are all the powers of sense
Employed on proofs of love immense!
The richest food remains unseen,
And highest gifts appear—how mean!
But here we have no boon on earth,
And faith alone discerns its worth.
The Word, not sense, must be our guide,
And faith assure since sight’s denied.
Lord, show us still that Thou art good
And grant us evermore this food.
Give faith to every wavering soul
And make each wounded spirit whole.

Here I labor and toil as I look for a home
Just an humble abode among men
While in Heaven a mansion is waiting for me
And a gentle voice pleading "come in"
There's a mansion now empty, just waiting for me
At the end of life's troublesome way
Many friends and dear loved ones will welcome me there
Near the door of that mansion some day
When my labor and toiling have ended below
And my hands shall lie folded in rest
I'll exchange this old home for a mansion up there
And invite the arch angel as guest

"Once for all I gave my life on Calv'ry;
I am now alive forever more,
An empty tomb will always be a witness;
I'm not coming this way anymore."
In my dreams I wandered back to Calv'ry,
To the place where Jesus bled and died.
In His hands my eyes beheld the nail scars;
And I saw the spear wound in His side.
As my tho'ts then wandered to the garden,
To the tomb wherein my Savior lay.
There the angel came and rolled the stone away;
He was gone - He is alive today! 
As I stooped and looked into the tomb there,
With the grave clothes lying separately,
As today I ponder all the reasons,
Seems I hear my Savior say to me: 
"Once for all I gave my life on Calv'ry;
I am now alive forever more,
An empty tomb will always be a witness;
I'm not coming this way anymore.
An empty tomb will always be a witness;
I'm not coming this way anymore.

An exile for the faith
of his incarnate Lord,
beyond the stars, beyond all space,
his soul in vision soared:
there saw in glory him
who liveth, and was dead,
there Judah's Lion, and the Lamb
that for our ransom bled:
there of the kingdom learned
the mysteries sublime;
how, sown in martyrs' blood, the faith
should spread from clime to clime.
Lord, give us grace, like him,
in thee to live and die;
to spurn the fleeting things of earth,
and seek for joys on high.
Jesus, our risen Lord,
we praise thee and adore,
who art with God the Father One
and Spirit evermore.

An image of that heavenly light,
the goal the Church keeps ay in sight,
Christ on the holy mount displays
where he outshines the sun's bright rays.
Let every age proclaimer be
how, on this day, the chosen three
with Moses and Elias heard
the Lord speak many a gracious word.
As witnesses to grace are nigh
those twain, the Law and Prophecy;
and to the Son, from out the cloud,
the Father's record thunders loud.
With garments whiter than the snows,
and shining face, Lord Jesus shows
what glory for those saints shall be
who joy in God with piety.
The vision and the mystery
make faithful hearts beat quick and high,
so on this solemn day of days
the cry goes up of prayer and praise.
O God the Father, God the Son,
and Holy Spirit, Three in One,
vouchsafe to bring us, by thy grace,
to see thy glory face to face.

An upper room did our Lord prepare
for those he loved until the end:
and his disciples still gather there,
to celebrate their Risen Friend.
A lasting gift Jesus gave his own,
to share his bread, his loving cup.
Whatever burdens may bow us down,
he by his Cross shall lift us up.
And after Supper he washed their feet,
for service, too, is sacrament.
In him our joy shall be made complete
sent out to serve, as he was sent.
No end there is! We depart in peace.
He loves beyond our uttermost:
in every room in our Father's house
he will be there, as Lord and host.

Long my restless soul had sought
Refuge from the troubled sea;
Struggling vainly till I thought
There was no repose for me;
Jesus whispered ’mid the storm,
“Trust Mine everlasting arm." 
As my spirit, terror-filled,
Breasted storm and tide alone,
Jesus came—the tempest stilled,
Hushed its loud and angry moan;
Standing on the restless wave,
Reached His hand my soul to save.
Jesus, Master of the sea,
Never let my vessel strand;
Keep me sheltered in the lee,
In the hollow of Thy hand,
Free from storm and tempest shock,
Anchored deeply in the rock.
Safely by the rock-bound coast,
And the treach’rous breakers past,
Guide me, lest my way be lost,
Into heaven’s port at last;
Stormy seas no more I’ll sail—
Safe at last within the veil.

WHEN I’M STANDING ON TOP 
OF A GREAT HIGH MOUNTAIN
THE WIND AND THE STORMS HOW THEY BLOW
WHEN IT’S ALL PASSED BY 
I’LL STILL BE STANDING HIGH
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW [I KNOW]
OLD SATAN CAN’T TOUCH MY SOUL
I’M LIVING FOR JESUS HIS HAND I WILL HOLD
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW
WHEN MY TIME DOWN HERE HAS COME AND GONE
AND MY BODY’S SO WEAK I CAN’T STAND
I LOOK INTO THE SKY AND THEN I REAL IZE
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW[I KNOW]
OLD SATAN CAN’T TOUCH MY SOUL
I’M LIVING FOR JESUS HIS HAND I WILL HOLD
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW [I KNOW]
OLD SATAN CAN’T TOUCH MY SOUL
I’M LIVING FOR JESUS HIS HAND I WILL HOLD
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW
I’M LIVING FOR JESUS HIS HAND I WILL HOLD
I’M ANCHORED IN THE ROCK I KNOW

Ancient of Days, who sittest throned in glory,
To Thee all knees are bent, all voices pray;
Thy love has blessed the wide world’s wondrous story
With light and life since Eden’s dawning day.
O Holy Father, Who hadst led Thy children
In all the ages, with the fire and cloud,
Through seas dry shod, through weary wastes bewildering;
To Thee, in reverent love, our hearts are bowed.
O Holy Jesus, Prince of Peace and Savior,
To Thee we owe the peace that still prevails,
Stilling the rude wills of men’s wild behavior,
And calming passion’s fierce and stormy gales.
O Holy Ghost, the Lord and the Lifegiver,
Thine is the quickening power that gives increase;
From Thee have flowed, as from a pleasant river,
Our plenty, wealth, prosperity and peace.
O Triune God, with heart and voice adoring,
Praise we the goodness that doth crown our days;
Pray we that Thou wilt hear us, still imploring
Thy love and favor kept to us always.

Holy words long preserved
For our walk in this world,
They resound with god's own heart
Oh, let the ancient words impart.
Words of life, words of hope
Give us strength, help us cope
In this world, where e'er we roam
Ancient words will guide us home.
Ancient words ever true
Changing me, and changing you.
We have come with open hearts
Oh let the ancient words impart.
Holy words of our faith
Handed down to this age.
Came to us through sacrifice
Oh heed the faithful words of christ.
Holy words long preserved
For our walk in this world.
They resound with god's own heart
Oh let the ancient words impart.

We have come with open hearts
Oh let the ancient words impart.

And Am I Blessed With Jesus' Love
And shall I dwell with Him above,
And will the joyful period come
When I shall call the heav'ns my home?
Think, O my soul! What must it be
A world of glorious minds to see,
Drink at the fountain-head of peace,
And bathe in everlasting bliss!
To hear them all at once proclaim
Eternal glories to the Lamb,
And join with joyful heart and tongue
That new, that never-ending song!
And does the happy hour draw near
When Christ will in the clouds appear,
And I without a vail shall see
The Man, the Christ, who bled for me?
If in my soul such joys abound
While weeping faith explores His wound,
How glorious will those scars appear
When perfect love forbids a tear!
Think, O my soul, if 't is so sweet
On earth to sit at Jesus' feet,
What must it be to wear a crown
And sit with Jesus on the throne!

And am I only born to die?
And must I suddenly comply
With nature’s stern decree?
What after death for me remains?
Celestial joys, or hellish pains,
To all eternity?
How then ought I on earth to live,
While God prolongs the kind reprieve
And props the house of clay?
My sole concern, my single care,
To watch, and tremble, and prepare
Against the fatal day.
No room for mirth or trifling here,
For worldly hope, or worldly fear,
If life so soon is gone:
If now the Judge is at the door,
And all mankind must stand before
The inexorable throne!
No matter which my thoughts employ,
A moment’s misery, or joy;
But O! when both shall end,
Where shall I find my destined place?
Shall I my everlasting days
With fiends, or angels spend?
Nothing is worth a thought beneath
But how I may escape the death
That never, never dies;
How make mine own election sure,
And, when I fail on earth, secure
A mansion in the skies.
Jesus, vouchsafe a pitying ray,
Be Thou my guide, be Thou my way
To glorious happiness;
Ah, write the pardon on my heart,
And whensoe’er I hence depart,
Let me depart in peace.

And are we yet alive,
And see each other’s face?
Glory and thanks to Jesus give
For His almighty grace!
Preserved by power divine
To full salvation here,
Again in Jesus’ praise we join
And in His sight appear.
What troubles have we seen,
What mighty conflicts past,
Fightings without, and fears within,
Since we assembled last!
Yet out of all the Lord
Hath brought us by His love;
And still He doth His help afford,
And hides our life above.
Then let us make our boast
Of His redeeming power,
Which saves us to the uttermost,
Till we can sin no more.
Let us take up the cross
Till we the crown obtain,
And gladly reckon all things loss
So we may Jesus gain.

And art Thou come with us to dwell,
Our Prince, our Guide, our Love, our Lord?
And is Thy Name Emmanuel,
God present with His world restored?
The heart is glad for Thee! It knows
None now shall bid it err or mourn;
And o’er its desert breaks the rose
In triumph o’er the grieving thorn.
Thou bringest all again; with Thee
Is light, is space, is breadth and room
For each thing fair, beloved, and free
To have its hour of life and bloom.
The world is glad for Thee! the heart
Is glad for Thee! and all is well,
And fixed and sure, because Thou art,
Whose Name is called Emmanuel.

And can I yet delay
My little all to give?
To tear my soul from earth away
For Jesus to receive?
Nay, but I yield, I yield;
I can hold out no more;
I sink, by dying love compelled,
And own Thee Conqueror.
Though late, I all forsake;
My friends, my all, resign;
Gracious Redeemer, take, O take,
And seal me ever Thine!
Come, and possess me whole,
Nor hence again remove;
Settle and fix my wavering soul
With all Thy weight of love.

And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Savior’s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain—
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
Amazing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
’Tis mystery all: th’Immortal dies:
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine.
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore;
Let angel minds inquire no more.
He left His Father’s throne above
So free, so infinite His grace—
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam’s helpless race:
’Tis mercy all, immense and free,
For O my God, it found out me!
’Tis mercy all, immense and free,
For O my God, it found out me!
Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray—
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
Still the small inward voice I hear,
That whispers all my sins forgiven;
Still the atoning blood is near,
That quenched the wrath of hostile Heaven.
I feel the life His wounds impart;
I feel the Savior in my heart.
I feel the life His wounds impart;
I feel the Savior in my heart.
No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England’s mountains green?
And was the Holy Lamb of God
On England’s pleasant pastures seen?
And did the countenance divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England’s green and pleasant land.

And didst Thou love the race that loved not Thee?
And didst Thou take to Heaven a human brow?
Dost plead with man’s voice by the marvelous sea?
Art Thou his Kinsman now?
O God, O Kinsman loved, but not enough,
O Man, with eyes majestic after death,
Whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough,
Whose lips drawn human breath!
By that one likeness which is ours and Thine,
By that one nature which doth hold us kin,
By that high Heaven where, sinless, Thou dost shine
To draw us sinners in;
By Thy last silence in the judgment hall,
By long foreknowledge of the deadly tree,
By darkness, by the wormwood and the gall,
I pray Thee visit me.
Come, lest this heart should, cold and cast away,
Die ere the Guest adored she entertain—
Lest eyes which never saw Thine earthly day
Should miss Thy heavenly reign.

And dost Thou say, “Ask what thou wilt"?
Lord, I would seize the golden hour;
I pray to be released from guilt,
And freed from sin and Satan’s power.
More of Thy presence, Lord, impart,
More of Thine image let me bear;
Erect Thy throne within my heart,
And reign without a rival there.
Give me to read my pardon sealed,
And from Thy joy to draw my strength;
To have Thy boundless love revealed
In all its height, and breadth, and length.
Grant these requests—I ask no more,
But to Thy care the rest resign;
Living or dying, rich or poor,
All shall be well if Thou art mine.

And Have I, Christ, No Love for Thee
Nor passion for thy charms?
Nor wish my Savior's face to see
And dwell with His arms?
Is there no spark of gratitude
In this cold heart of mine,
To Him whose gen'rous bosom glowed
With friendship all divine?
Can I pronounce His charming name,
His acts of kindness tell,
And while I dwell upon the theme,
No sweet emotion feel?
Such base ingratitude as this,
What heart but must detest?
Sure Christ deserves the noblest place
In ev'ry human breast.
A very wretch, Lord, I should prove,
Had I no love to thee:
Rather than not my Savior love,
O may I cease to be.

And I beheld and I heard
The voice of many angels
Round about the throne
And the beasts and the elders
And the number to them
Was ten thousand times ten thousand
And thousands and thousands
Saying with a loud voice:
Blessing and Honor and Glory and Power
Be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne
And unto the Lamb, forever and ever
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain

And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
(With lead-in)
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I won't let the evening bring me down
Now that you're around me
And I love you too (love you)
Your thoughts are just for me (just for me)
You set my spirit free (set me free)
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief (book of life is brief)
And once a page is read (once a page is read)
All but love is brief
That is my belief 

And is it so—I shall be like Thy Son?
Is this the grace which He for me has won?
Father of glory (thought beyond all thought!)—
In glory, to His own blest likeness brought!
Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like to Thee?
Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see
Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,
Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.
Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest
Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest.
That love that gives not as the world, but shares
All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.
Nor I alone; Thy loved ones all, complete
In glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet,
All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,
Object supreme of all, by all adored.
The heart is satisfied; can ask no more
All thought of self is now forever o’er:
Christ, its un-mingled Object, fills the heart
In blest adoring love—the endless part.
Father of mercies, in Thy presence bright
All this shall be unfolded in the light;
Thy children all, with joy Thy counsels know
Fulfilled; patient in hope, while here below.

And is it so? “A little while,"
And then the life undying,
The light of God’s unclouded smile,
The singing for the sighing?
“A little while!" O glorious word,
Sweet solace of our sorrow;
And then “forever with the Lord,"
The everlasting morrow.
Then be it ours to journey on
In paths that He decrees us,
Where His own feet before have gone,
Our strength, our hope, our Jesus;
In lowly fellowship with Him
The cross appointed bearing;
For O a crown no grief can dim
One day we shall be wearing.
O ’twill be passing sweet to gaze
On Him in all His glory;
And lost in love and glad amaze
To shout redemption’s story;
Till angels bend to catch the strain
Our human lips are swelling,
And “worthy is the Lamb once slain,"
Resounds through Heaven’s high dwelling.

And is the time approaching,
By prophets long foretold,
When all shall dwell together,
One Shepherd and one fold?
Shall every idol perish,
To moles and bats be thrown,
And every prayer be offered
To God in Christ alone?
Shall Jew and Gentile, meeting
From many a distant shore,
Around one altar kneeling,
One common Lord adore?
Shall all that now divides us
Remove, and pass away
Like shadows of the morning
Before the blaze of day?
Shall all that now unites us
More sweet and lasting prove,
A closer bond of union
In a blest land of love?
Shall war be learned no longer,
Shall strife and tumult cease;
All earth His blessed kingdom,
The Lord and Prince of Peace?
O long expected dawning,
Come with Thy cheering ray;
When shall the morning brighten,
The shadows flee away?
O sweet anticipation!
It cheers the watchers on
To pray, and hope, and labor,
Till the dark night be gone.

And let our bodies part,
To different climes repair;
Inseparably joined in heart
The friends of Jesus are.
O let us still proceed
In Jesus’ work below;
And, following our triumphant Head,
To further conquests go!
The vineyard of the Lord
Before His laborers lies;
And lo! we see the vast reward
Which waits us in the skies.
O let our heart and mind
Continually ascend,
That haven of repose to find,
Where all our labors end.
When all our toils are o’er,
Our suffering and our pain!
Who meet on that eternal shore
Shall never part again.
O happy, happy place,
Where saints and angels meet;
There we shall see each other’s face,
And all our brethren greet.

And let this feeble body fail,
And let it droop and die;
My soul shall quit the mournful vale,
And soar to worlds on high;
Shall join the disembodied saints,
And find its long sought rest,
That only bliss for which it pants,
In my Redeemer’s breast.
In hope of that immortal crown
I now the cross sustain,
And gladly wander up and down,
And smile at toil and pain:
I suffer out my threescore years,
Till my Deliverer come,
And wipe away His servant’s tears,
And take His exile home.
O what hath Jesus bought for me!
Before my ravished eyes
Rivers of life divine I see,
And trees of paradise:
I see a world of spirits bright,
Who taste the pleasures there;
They all are robed in spotless white,
And conquering palms they bear.
O what are all my sufferings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that enraptured host to appear,
And worship at Thy feet!
Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends away,
But let me find them all again
In that eternal day.

And may I hope that when no more
My pulse shall beat with life below,
I shall the God of grace adore,
And all the bliss of glory know?
I, who deserve no place but hell.
No portion but devouring fire,
Shall I with Christ my Savior dwell,
Possessed of all I now desire?
Will Jesus own a wretch like me,
And tell to saints and angels round,
That when he suffered on the tree,
My sins did cause his ev'ry wound?
He will! I read it in his word,
And in my heart the witness feel;
I shall be with, and like my Lord,
Though sin oppose, in league with hell.
I shall be with Him when he comes
Triumphant down the pathless skies;
And when his voice breaks up the tombs,
Among his children I shall rise.

And must I be to judgment brought,
And answer in that day,
For every vain and idle thought,
And every word I say? 
Yes, every secret of my heart,
Shall shortly be made known,
And I receive my just desert
For all that I have done.
How careful, then ought I to live,
With what religious fear!
Who such a strict account must give
For my behavior here.
Thou awful Judge of quick and dead,
The watchful power bestow;
So shall I to my ways take heed,
To all I speak or do.
If now Thou standest at the door,
O let me feel Thee near,
And make my peace with God, before
I at Thy bar appear.

And Must this body die?
This mortal frame decay?
And must these active limbs of mine
Lie mould'ring in the clay?
Corruption, earth, and worms
Shall but refine this flesh
Till my triumphant spirit comes
To put it on afresh.
God my Redeemer lives,
And always from the skies
Looks down, and watches all my dust
Till he shall bid it rise.
Arrayed in glorious grace
Shall these vile bodies shine.
And ev'ry shape and ev'ry face
Look heav'nly and divine.
These lively hopes we owe.
To Jesus' saving love;
We would adore his grace below,
And sing his pow'r above.
Dear Lord, accept the praise
Of these, our humble songs,
Till tunes of nobler sound we raise
With our immortal tongues.

And my God will meet all your needs
According to his riches
His glorious riches 
Found in Jesus Christ
To our God and Father be glory forever
To our God and Father be glory forever
To our God and Father be glory forever
To our God and Father be glory forever
And my God will meet all your needs
And my God will meet all your needs
And my God will meet all your needs
And my God will meet all your needs
According to his riches that's found in Jesus Christ
He is meeting all our needs and he has paid the price
No matter what we hope for or what we need in life
God will give us all we need through Jesus' sacrifice
Who's gonna meet your needs? Jesus, Jesus
Who's gonna meet your needs? Well, I know, I know he's gonna meet your needs
Who's gonna meet your needs? I know he will be with you
Who's gonna meet your needs? Beyond a doubt he'll meet all your needs
Who's gonna meet your needs? Jesus
Who's gonna meet your needs? I believe that Jesus will
Who's gonna meet your needs? I know he will be with you
Who's gonna meet your needs?
To our God and Father be glory forever
To our God and Father be glory forever
And my God will meet all your needs
And my God will meet all your needs 

And now, beloved Lord, Thy Soul resigning,
Into Thy Father’s arms with conscious will,
Calmly, with reverend grace, Thy head inclining,
The throbbing brow and laboring breast grow still.
Freely Thy life Thou yieldest, meekly bending
E’en to the last beneath our sorrows’ load,
Yet strong in death, in perfect peace commending,
Thy Spirit to Thy Father and Thy God.
My Savior, in mine hour of mortal anguish,
When earth grows dim, and round me falls the night,
O breathe Thy peace, as flesh and spirit languish,
At that dread eventide let there be light.
To Thy dear cross turn Thou my eyes in dying;
Lay but my fainting head upon Thy breast;
Those outstretched arms receive my latest sighing;
And then, oh! then, Thine everlasting rest.
O love! o’er mortal agony victorious,
Now is Thy triumph! now that cross shall shine
To earth’s remotest age revered and glorious,
Of suffering’s deepest mystery the sign.
The present, past and future here are blending,
Moment supreme in this world’s history,
Mid darkness, opening graves, and mountains rending,
New light is dawning on humanity.

And now, my soul, another year
Of thy short life is past;
I cannot long continue here,
And this may be my last.
Awake, my soul! with utmost care
Thy true condition learn;
What are thy hopes, how sure? how fair?
What is thy great concern?
Behold, another year begins!
Set out afresh for Heaven;
Seek pardon for thy former sins,
In Christ so freely given.
Devoutly yield thyself to God,
And on His grace depend;
With zeal pursue the heavenly road,
Nor doubt a happy end.

And now, O Father, mindful of the love
That bought us, once for all, on Calvary’s tree,
And having with us Him that pleads above,
We here present, we here spread forth to Thee,
That only offering perfect in Thine eyes,
The one true, pure, immortal sacrifice.
Look, Father, look on His anointed face,
And only look on us as found in Him;
Look not on our misusings of Thy grace,
Our prayer so languid, and our faith so dim;
For lo! between our sins and their reward,
We set the passion of Thy Son our Lord.
And then for those, our dearest and our best,
By this prevailing presence we appeal;
O fold them closer to Thy mercy’s breast!
O do Thine utmost for their souls’ true weal!
From tainting mischief keep them white and clear,
And crown Thy gifts with strength to persevere.
And so we come; O draw us to Thy feet,
Most patient Savior, Who canst love us still!
And by this food, so awful and so sweet,
Deliver us from every touch of ill:
In Thine own service make us glad and free,
And grant us nevermore to part with Thee.

And now the wants are told, that brought
Thy children to Thy knee;
Here lingering still, we ask for naught,
But simply worship Thee.
The hope of Heav’n’s eternal days
Absorbs not all the heart
That gives Thee glory, love, and praise
For being what Thou art.
For Thou art God, the One, the Same,
O’er all things high and bright;
And round us, when we speak Thy Name,
There spreads a heav’n of light.
O wondrous peace, in thought to dwell
On excellence divine;
To know that naught in man can tell
How fair Thy beauties shine!
O Thou, above all blessing blest,
O’er thanks exalted far,
Thy very greatness is a rest
To weaklings as we are;
For when we feel the praise of Thee
A task beyond our powers,
We say, “A perfect God is He,
And He is fully ours."
All glory to the Father be,
All glory to the Son,
All glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,
While endless ages run.

And now this holy day
Is drawing to its end,
Once more, to Thee, O Lord,
Our thanks and prayers we send.
We thank Thee for this rest
From earthly care and strife;
We thank Thee for this help
To higher, holier life.
We thank Thee for Thy house;
It is Thy palace-gate
Where Thou, upon Thy throne
Of mercy, still dost wait.
We thank Thee for Thy Word,
Thy Gospel’s joyful sound;
Oh, may its holy fruits
Within our hearts abound!
Yet, ere we go to rest,
Father, to Thee we pray,
Forgive the sins that stain
E’en this Thy holy day.
Through Jesus let the past
Be blotted from Thy sight,
And let us all now sleep
At peace with Thee this night.
To God the Father, Son,
And Spirit glory be,
From all in earth and Heav’n,
Through all eternity.

How wide is the love of Christ
How long it will be
How high He has lifted my life
How deep is His love for you and me
How wide (how wide) is the love of Christ
How long (how long) it will be
How high (how high) He has lifted my life
How deep is His love for you (for you) and me 
And so I bow before the Father
From whom we take our name
Yes I bow before the Father
Whose love is always the same
I pray that Jesus will live in your hearts, by faith
Giving glory from heaven above
That all of His children will understand
The depths of their Father's love 
And so I bow before the Father
From whom we take our name
Yes I bow before the Father
Whose love is always the same
I pray that your heart will be strong
Through His spirit of love
That you'll see how it can be
That your life will be built on the love of our Lord
The foundation of our strength 

You make Your face to shine on me
And that my soul knows very well
You lift me up, I'm cleansed and free
And that my soul knows very well
When mountains fall, I'll stand
By the power of Your hand
And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell
And that my soul knows very well.
Joy and strength each day I find
And that my soul knows very well
Forgiveness, hope I know is mine
And that my soul knows very well

When I see you 
My heart cries 
When I see you 
I fall away 
When I see you 
My heart dies 
When I see you 
I see myself 
And I'm falling 
O I'm falling 
I'm falling 
So in love with you 
You're so in love with me 
We're so in love together 
We are free indeed 
And I'm deep as the ocean is wide 
I AM big as the sky is endless 
I AM constantly moving 
I AM constantly flowing 
I AM constantly thinking 
I AM constantly growing 
Inside you 
O When you're inside me 
And there is nothing else 
And you are everything 
And then some..
And you are everything 
Yeah, you are everything 
And then some.

I sang to the people in Russia
As they were searching for the truth
Their eyes were so cold and empty
From the eldest to the youth
What a privilege I had to carry
The joy of the God we love
And I sang of the Christ, His compassionate life
Of a home He's prepared above
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God because of me
I sang to the people in Africa
Some who didn't have food to eat
In the depths of full-blown poverty
Most were living out in the street
What a thrill to deliver the Gospel
To a people who were so distressed
Holding back the tears and the cultural fears
Overwhelmingly I was impressed
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God instead of me
I sang to the people in my hometown
Trying to guess their minds
Most had already heard the precious Word
Of a God who's good and kind
As I sang I could tell that they knew it
I didn't sing for the joy of the song
But because of a Cross and a Savior's loss
To deliver mankind gone wrong
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God in spite of me 
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God (praised God)
And they praised God because of me 

And this is life eternal
That they might know thee, the only true God
And Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent 
I have glorified beyond the earth
I have finished the work which thou givest me to do
And now oh Father
Glorify thou me with thine own self
With the glory which I had with Thee
Before the world was (world was) 
I have manifested thy name
Unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world
Thine they were and thou givest them me
And they have kept thy Word 

And truly it is a most glorious thing
Thus to hear men pray and God’s praises sing,
O how great comfort is it now to see—
The churches to enjoy full liberty.
And to have the Gospel preached here with power,
And such wolves repelled as all would else devour.
But God will still for His people provide
Such as be able them to help and guide,
If they cleave to Him and do not forsake—
His laws and truth and their own ways do take.
If thou hast viewed the camp of Israel,
How God in the wilderness with them did dwell.
His great and marvelous works they here saw,
And He them taught in His most holy law,
A small emblem hereof thou mayest see,
How God hath dealt with them in some degree,
For much of Himself they now there have seen,
And marvelous to them His works have been.

And will the Judge descend,
And must the dead arise
And not a single soul escape
His all discerning eyes?
And from His righteous lips
Shall this dread sentence sound
And through the numerous guilty throng
Spread black despair around:
“Depart from Me, accursed,
To everlasting flame,
For rebel angels first prepared,
Where mercy never came"?
How will my heart endure
The terrors of that day
When earth and Heav’n before His face
Astonished shrink away?
But ere that trumpet shakes
The mansions of the dead,
Hark from the Gospel’s cheering sound
What joyful tidings spread:
Ye sinners, seek His grace
Whose wrath ye cannot bear;
Fly to the shelter of His cross
And find salvation there.

And will the great eternal God
On earth establish His abode?
And will He, from His radiant throne,
Accept our temple for His own?
These walls we to Thy honor raise;
Long may they echo with Thy praise;
And Thou, descending, fill the place
With choicest tokens of Thy grace.
Here let the great Redeemer reign,
With all the graces of His train;
While power divine His Word attends,
To conquer foes, and cheer His friends.
And in that great decisive day,
When God the nations shall survey,
May it before the world appear
That crowds were born to glory here.

And wilt Thou pardon, Lord,
A sinner such as I,
Although Thy book his crimes record,
Of such a crimson dye?
So deep are they engraved,
So terrible their fear,
The righteous scarcely shall be saved,
And where shall I appear?
O Thou Physician blest,
Make clean my guilty soul
And me, by many a sin oppressed,
Restore and keep me whole.
I know not how to praise
Thy mercy and Thy love;
But deign my soul from earth to raise
And learn from Thee above.

My latest sun is sinking fast,
My race is nearly run.
My strongest trials now are past,
My triumph has begun.
(EOh, come, angel band,
Come and around me stand,
Oh, bear me away on your snow white wings,
To my im(E7)mortal home.
Oh bear my longing heart to Him,
Who bled and died for me.
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin,
And gives me victory.
I know I'm near the holy ranks,
Of friends and kindred dear.
I've brushed the dew on Jordan's banks,
The crossing must be near.
I've almost gained my Heavenly home,
My spirit loudly sings.
The Holy ones, behold they come,
I hear the noise of wings.

Angels from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o’er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation’s story
Now proclaim Messiah’s birth.
Come and worship, come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
Shepherds, in the field abiding,
Watching o’er your flocks by night,
God with us is now residing;
Yonder shines the infant light:
Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of nations;
Ye have seen His natal star.
Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear;
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear.
Sinners, wrung with true repentance,
Doomed for guilt to endless pains,
Justice now revokes the sentence,
Mercy calls you; break your chains.
Though an Infant now we view Him,
He shall fill His Father’s throne,
Gather all the nations to Him;
Every knee shall then bow down:
All creation, join in praising
God, the Father, Spirit, Son,
Evermore your voices raising
To th’eternal Three in One.

In the great book of John - you're warned of the day
When you'll be laid - beneath the cold clay
The Angel Of Death - will come from the sky
And claim your poor soul - when the time comes to die
When the Angel Of Death - comes down after you
Can you smile and say - that you have been true
Can you truthfully say - with your dyin' breath
That you're ready to meet - the Angel Of Death.
When the lights all grow dim - and the dark shadows creep
And then your loved ones - are gathered to weep
Can you face them and say - with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet - the Angel Of Death.

Angel of peace, thou hast wandered too long;
Spread thy white wings to the sunshine of love!
Come while our voices are blended in song,
Fly to our ark like the storm-beaten dove—
Fly to our ark on the wings of the dove;
Speed o’er the far-sounding billows of song,
Crowned with the olive leaf garland of love;
Angel of peace, thou hast waited too long!
Brothers we meet on this altar of thine,
Mingling the gifts we have gathered for thee;
Sweet with the odors of myrtle and pine,
Breeze of the prairie and breath of the sea—
Meadow and mountain and forest and sea;
Sweet is the fragrance of myrtle and pine,
Sweeter the incense we offer to thee,
Brothers once more round this altar of thine!
Angels of Bethlehem, answer the strain!
Hark! a new birth-song is filling the sky!
Loud as the storm wind that tumbles the main,
Bid the full breath of the organ reply—
Loud let the tempest of voices reply;
Roll its long surge like the earth-shaking main!
Swell the vast song till it mounts to the sky!
Angels of Bethlehem, echo the strain!

Angel voices, ever singing, round Thy throne of light,
Angel harps, forever ringing, rest not day or night;
Thousands only live to bless Thee, and confess Thee Lord of might.
Thou Who art beyond the farthest mortal eye can scan,
Can it be that Thou regardest songs of sinful man?
Can we feel that Thou art near us and wilt hear us? Yea, we can.
Lord, we know Thy love rejoices o’er each work of Thine;
Thou didst ears and hands and voices for Thy praise combine;
Craftsman’s art and music’s measure for Thy pleasure didst design.
Here, great God, today we offer of Thine own to Thee;
And for Thine acceptance proffer, all unworthily,
Hearts and minds, and hands and voices, in our choicest melody.
Honor, glory, might and merit, Thine shall ever be,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, blessed Trinity;
Of the best that Thou hast given Earth and Heaven render Thee.

O’er the hills in far Judea,
Rang the first glad Christmas song;
’Twas a grand angelic ,
Shepherds saw the shining throng.
Glory streamed across the heavens,
Music echoed thro’ the air;
Christ the Morning Star hath risen!
Tell the tidings everywhere.
Angels adore Him,
Hark! We seem to hear
Echoes from Heaven,
Angel echoes clear.
Jesus the mighty
Came to earth to bring
Priceless redemption
Christ our Prophet, Priest and King!
Tell again the sweet old story,
Of the shepherds on the hill,
When the angels from the glory
Sang while all the world was still.
Tell again the story wondrous,
Of the Infant in the stall,
Of the guiding star above Him,
Shining o’er the Lord of all.
Angels wondered at His coming,
To this scene of earthly night,
From the fadeless day in glory,
From His home so wondrous bright;
Angels looked in deep amazement,
At the manger of His birth,
Understanding not His purpose,
To redeem this sinful earth.

Angels from Heaven,
Spoke to the shepherds,
"Greetings we
bring to thee
Bethlehem tidings
Come from a manger,
On this morn, Christ is born."
Angels from Heaven
spoke to the shepherds,
"You will see
One who'll be
Lord of the future,
King and Redeemer,
Son of God, Son of God!"

Angels holy, high and lowly,
Sing the praises of the Lord!
Earth and sky, all living nature,
Man the stamp of thy Creator,
Praise ye, praise ye, God the Lord!
Rock and highland, wood and island,
Crag where eagle’s pride hath soared;
Mighty mountains, purple breasted,
Peaks cloud-cleaving, snowy crested,
Praise ye, praise ye, God the Lord!
Rolling river, praise Him ever,
From the mountain’s deep vein poured;
Silver fountain, clearly gushing,
Troubled torrent, madly rushing,
Praise ye, praise ye, God the Lord!
Praise Him ever, bounteous Giver!
Praise Him, Father, Friend and Lord!
Each glad soul its free course winging,
Each blithe voice its free song singing,
Praise the great and mighty Lord!

Angels long to look into these things (The glory of Jesus 
He has given us new birth into a living hope 
Through his resurrection from the dead 
He has given us a new birth into inheritance 
That can never perish, spoil or fade 
In this we greatly rejoice even though we suffer 
Grief and trials, we have genuine faith 
We are filled with joy, we love him, we believe in him 
Even though we have not seen his face 
Joy inexpressible and glorious 
We are receiving the goal of our faith 
He prophets intently searched, searched with the greatest care 
To find the time when Christ would come 
It was not revealed to those who were searching then 
But now we know the glory of the Son 
Concerning this salvation the grace that has come to us 
Praise God the mystery's been revealed 
We are filled with joy, we love him we believe in him 
And angels long to look in these things 
Joy inexpressible and glorious 
We are receiving the goal of our faith 
Reapeat 

Angels, roll the rock away,
Death, yield up your mighty Prey.
See, the Savior leaves the tomb,
Glowing with immortal bloom,
Glowing with immortal bloom.
’Tis the Savior! angels, raise
Fame’s eternal trump of praise.
Let the world’s remotest bound
Hear the joy inspiring sound,
Hear the joy inspiring sound.
Now ye saints, lift up your eyes
Now to glory see Him rise,
In long triumph up the sky,
Up to waiting worlds on high,
Up to waiting worlds on high.
or
Hail! victorious Jesus, hail!
On Thy cloud of glory sail
In long triumph through the sky,
Up to waiting worlds on high,
Up to waiting worlds on high.
Heaven unfolds its portals wide,
Glorious Hero, through them ride:
King of glory mount Thy throne,
Thy great Father’s, and Thine own,
Thy great Father’s, and Thine own.
Praise Him all ye heavenly choirs,
Raptured, sweep your sounding lyres
Sons of men, in humbler strain,
Sing your mighty Savior’s reign,
Sing your mighty Savior’s reign.
Every note with wonder swell;
Sin o’erthrown, and captived hell!
Where is now, O death! thy sting?
Where thy terrors, vanquished king,
Where thy terrors, vanquished king!

Had you been the only one (only one), He would've gone to Calvary (Calvary)
Angels are praying (angels pray) when you're on bended knee (bended knee)
When just one soul truly gives their heart to Him
Angels are singing, shouting, and bringing praises to the Lamb
Angels sing holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
And we sing holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
If He hadn't known the pain (known the pain), if Christ hadn't felt that agony 
(agony)
Then we'd all been lost (all been lost) condemned eternally (eternally)
When a child is born into the Father's family
I know heaven rejoices, a of voices, singing glory to the King
Angels rejoice when a lost child's voice is heard singing the praise of the 
lamb, of the lamb
And we sing holy (holy), holy (holy), holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come (and is to come)
And we sing holy (holy), holy (holy), holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come (and is to come)

Spoken Vocal: "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and 
is to come.Forever and ever, Amen."

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o’er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

Angel your march oppose,
Who still in strength excel,
Your secret, sworn, eternal foes,
Countless, invisible.
With rage that never ends
Their hellish arts they try;
Legions of dire malicious fiends,
And spirits enthroned on high.
On earth the usurpers reign,
Exert their baneful power,
O’er the poor fallen sons of men
They tyrannize their hour:
But shall believers fear?
But shall believers fly?
Or see the bloody cross appear,
And all their power defy?
Jesus’ tremendous Name
Puts all our foes to flight:
Jesus, the meek, the angry Lamb,
A Lion is in fight.
By all hell’s host withstood,
We all hell’s host o’erthrow;
And conquering them, through Jesus’ blood,
We still to conquer go.
Our Captain leads us on;
He beckons from the skies,
And reaches out a starry crown,
And bids us take the prize:
“Be faithful unto death;
Partake My victory;
And thou shalt wear this glorious wreath.
And thou shalt reign with Me."

Angry words! O let them never,
From the tongue unbridled slip,
May the heart’s best impulse ever,
Check them ere they soil the lip.
Love one another thus saith the Savior,
Children obey the Father’s blest command,
Love each other, love each other,
’Tis the Father’s blest command.
Love is much too pure and holy,
Friendship is too sacred far,
For a moment’s reckless folly,
Thus to desolate and mar.
Angry words are lightly spoken,
Bitterest thoughts are rashly stirred,
Brightest links of life are broken,
By a single angry word.

(Em) We lease twenty acres and one Ginny mule
(BFrom the Alabama (Em) trust.
For half of the cotton and a third of the corn
(BWe get a handful of (Em) dust.
We cannot have all things to please us,
No matter how we (Em) try.
Until we've all gone to Jesus,
We can only wonder (Em) why.(Em)
I had a daughter, called her Annabelle,
She's the apple of my eye.
Tried to give her something like I've never had,
Didn't ever want to hear her cry.
Inst.Break: Em, C, G, D (x3)
When I'm dead and buried I'll take a hard life of tears,
From every day I've ever known.
Anna's in the churchyard, she's got no life at all,
She's only got these words on a stone.

Our fathers, in the years grown dim, reared slowly, wall by wall
A holy dwelling place for Him, that filleth all in all.
They wrought His house of faith and prayer, the rainbow round the throne,
A precious temple builded fair on Christ the Cornerstone.
The angel of the golden reed hath found the measure strait;
He hears the Great Foundation plead for ampler wall and gate.
The living pillars of the Truth grown on from morn to morn,
And still the heresy of youth is age’s creed outworn.
But steadfast is their inner shrine wrought of the heart’s fine gold,
Its hunger and its thirst divine, with jewels manifold,
Red sard of pain, hope’s emerald gleam, white peace, no glory missed
Of righteous life and saintly dream, jasper to amethyst.
Spirit of truth, forbid that we who now God’s temple are
And keep the faith with minds more free, our father’s fabric mar.
Better than thoughts the stars that search is self still sacrificed,
For only love can build the church whose cornerstone is Christ.

Anointed One, Messiah, Lord.
Savior, Christ, Good News, Great Joy,
Eternal God, now dwelling with man.
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.
Immanuel, the Holy Son, Shepherd, Ruler, Mighty One.
Descended to Earth according to plan,
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.
With angels we sing Your glory,
With shepherds we give God praise,
With wise men we come before You,
To worship You all our days!
The Word, now flesh, in Him is life.
One and Only, Shining Light.
Full grace and truth, we now understand,
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace,
Wonderful Couns’lor, King of Kings.
No end there will be to Your increase,
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.
Alpha and Omega, Master and Friend.
All in all, Forgiver of sin,
Creator, Designer, Beginning and End.
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.
All glory, honor, blessing and strength,
Wisdom, power, mercy and grace,
Past, present, and future contained in His hands,
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem,
The Baby of Bethlehem.

I'm thirsty Lord, yes, I'm thirsty Lord
I'm thirsty Lord for the Living Waters of life
I want a drink, I want a drink
I want a drink of the living Waters of Life
Fill me up Lord, I don't have to feel it
Lord make me drunk with your Holy Spirit
And I'll take a drink, and I'll take a drink
And I'll take a drink of the Living Waters of life
Fill me up Lord, I don't have to feel it
Lord make me drunk with your Holy Spirit
I'm tired of whisperin', I'll start to shoutin'
I don't want a cup Lord, give me a fountain
I'll take another drink, I'll take another drink
I'll take another drink of the Living Waters of life

There’s a voice I hear, and it calls me near
To the Savior’s bleeding side;
And it says to me, “You may now be free,
If you plunge beneath the crimson tide."
O, I’ll take another look at the cross of Calvary,
For surely He can cleanse by the precious blood;
There is purity and power,
There is victory every hour,
When we’re living ’neath the smile of God.
There is One above, looking down in love,
On a world deep sunk in sin;
And I hear Him call to His children all:
“Who will go and bring the lost ones in?"
There’s a hand stretched out unto souls in doubt,
And it saves from sin and woe;
In His riven side is a fountain wide,
Where the vilest of the vile may go.
O the bitter cries, and the longing eyes,
That we daily hear and see;
For our love they plead, and our help they need;
Shall we saviors of the lost ones be?
O the joy to stand on the golden strand,
Right before the great white throne;
There to meet some soul we have helped to the goal,
And to hear the Savior say, “Well done."

LORD I FEEL SO WEAK AND WEARY
AND MY RACE IS ALMOST RUN
AND I LONG TO SEE MY SAVIOUR WITH A SMILE
BUT THERE’S MANY LOST DOWN HERE 
AND I LONG TO SEE THEM SAVED
SO JUST GIVE ME STRENGTH TO WALK ANOTHER MILE
ANOTHER [D ]MILE (ANOTHER MILE)
ANOTHER MILE (ANOTHER MILE)
OH JUST GIVE ME STRENGTH TO WALK ANOTHER MILE
IF YOU’LL GUIDE MY WEARY FEET
AND JUST HELP MY TONGUE TO SPEAK
LORD I THINK THAT I CAN WALK ANOTHER MILE
OH THE MANY TIMES DOWN HERE 
WHEN OLE SATAN SEEMS SO NEAR 
YOU WERE THERE TO HELP ME 
THROUGH EACH LONG HARD TRIAL 
YOU GAVE ME STRENGTH THROUGH YOU 
FOR THE [G ]THINGS I COULDN’T DO
SO JUST GIVE ME STRENGTH TO WALK ANOTHER MILE
SOON I’LL LAY THESE BURDENS DOWN
THEN I’LL HEAD FOR HIGHER GROUND
THERE TO SEE THOSE GONE BEFORE ME AFTER WHILE
AS THEY GREET ME FROM THAT SHORE 
WHERE THER’S HEATACHES NEVER MORE
LORD I’LL HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WALK ANOTHER MILE

Another Sabbath day has come,
Another week is o’er;
And we, a grateful, happy throng,
Are gathered here once more:
We meet to sing of Jesus’ love,
And bow to Him in prayer,
We meet to read His holy Word,
And learn our duty there.
Our Sunday school, our Sunday school;
No place on earth so dear!
How many precious souls have found
The way to glory here;
And now around the shining throne
They wait for us to come
And share with them the fadeless love
Of their eternal home.
Oh, may the seed thus early sown
Spring up on goodly ground,
And in our hearts, our souls and lives
May fruit of grace abound—
Immortal fruit, that yet shall bloom
In paradise above,
Where we, with those now gone before,
Shall sing redeeming love.

Another six days’ work is done
Another Sabbath is begun;
Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,
Improve the day that God hath blest.
Come, praise the Lord, Whose love assigns
So sweet a rest to weary minds;
Provides an antepast of Heaven
And gives this day the food of seven.
O that our thoughts and thanks may rise
As grateful incense to the skies!
And draw from Heaven that sweet repose
Which none but he who feels it knows.
A heavenly calm pervades the breast
Is the dear pledge of glorious rest,
Which for the Church of God remains,
The end of cares, the end of pains.
With joy, great God, Thy works we view,
In various scenes, both old and new;
With praise we think on mercies past,
With hope we future pleasure taste.
In holy duties let the day,
In holy comforts pass away;
The Sabbath thus we love to spend,
In hope of one which ne’er shall end.

I've stood on the bank by the weeping willow,
With another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
With another wide river to cross.
I believe I can make it to the other side,
'Cos I feel a hand on me,
Helping me with another wide river to cross.
When I wake up to many a day,
With another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
I jump right in the dark and I swim right on, toward the light on the other 
side.
It's always there when there's another wide river to cross.
(Key change to B for the rest of the song)
Oh the whirlpools twist and pull at me,
With another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
With another wide river to cross.
If I reach up a hand is always reaching down for me.
It's always there when there's (F#) another wide river to cross.
Well the river Jordan is a narrow stream,
But it's another wide river to cross.
It's another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
But I believe that there's a resting place that's provided just for me,
On the heaven's side of another wide river to cross.

Another year completed,
The day comes round once more
Which with our patron’s radiance
Is bright as heretofore.
Now, strong in hope, united
His festival we greet;
He will present our troubles
Before the mercy-seat.
The Scriptures tell how Moses
Did for the people pray,
Appeased the Judge eternal,
And turned His wrath away;
Elijah’s prayer had power,
To close and open Heav’n;
Such saints as were aforetime,
Such saints to us are giv’n.
O saint of God, beloved,
And placed on His right hand,
Thy prayers be like a rampart
As ’gainst the foe we stand;
For Abraham’s God is thy God,
And Isaac’s God is thine,
Thine is the God of Jacob,
The Lord of power benign.
For forty years His Israel
He fed with angels’ food;
The flinty rock He opened
The streams of water flowed.
Entreat that Christ His people
May lead to victory:
The God of Joshua’s triumph
The Lord thy God is He.

Another year is dawning, dear Father, let it be
In working or in waiting, another year with Thee.
Another year of progress, another year of praise,
Another year of proving Thy presence all the days.
Another year of mercies, of faithfulness and grace,
Another year of gladness in the shining of Thy face;
Another year of leaning upon Thy loving breast;
Another year of trusting, of quiet, happy rest.
Another year of service, of witness for Thy love,
Another year of training for holier work above.
Another year is dawning, dear Father, let it be
On earth, or else in Heaven, another year for Thee.

You will answer, ask and it is mine;
You will answer, seek and I will find.
You will answer, ask and it is mine;
You will answer, seek and I will find.
Whatever I do and wherever I go you will be there;
Whatever I need and whenever I call you will answer.
I make the mistake of working on my own.
But then I awake to see I can't alone.
You wrap your arms around me, then you comfort me
And give me just what I need.
When troubles defy you know that I can rely on your providence;
When tough times annoy I can count it pure joy, perseverance.
The trials that I've had and the things I've done.
The good and the bad comes to everyone
With any situation it's assuring to know
Anytime I can go.
That special place alone I long to meet you there;
I'm happy knowing you'll answer my prayer.

Oh Lord let it be known today
That You are God
And let it be known
That we are Your servants
Oh Lord we have obeyed Your Word
For You are God
Let it be known that You are our God
Turn the hearts of Your people
Back to You again
We are watching, we are waiting
When will You bring revival?
Answer us, oh answer us
Send Your fire, send Your rain
Answer us, oh answer us
Won't You demonstrate Your power
Answer us, oh answer us
Send Your fire, send Your rain
Answer us, oh answer us
Won't You bring Your revelation once again
Oh Lord let it be seen today
That You are God
Stretch out Your hand and send fire from heaven
Oh Lord let it be seen today
That You are God
Stretch our Your hand and send rain from heaven

Anthems to God above,
Source of eternal love,
Now let us sing!
Praise our Creator’s Name,
Come as our fathers came,
Hail, and with loud acclaim,
Our God and King!
Thanks for our favored land,
By His almighty hand
Guarded from ill;
Thanks for the dew and rain,
Broad field and sunny plain,
Where stores of fruit and grain
Our garners fill.
Thanks for our banner bright,
Spangled with starry light,
Boast of the free;
Signal to those oppressed,
Honored, revered and blest,
Waving its noble crest,
O’er land and sea.
Lord, from Thy throne on high,
Bend Thine approving eye
O’er us, we pray.
This be our one desire:
Faith, love and zeal inspire,
Light with devotion’s fire
Our souls today.

When the last earth-tie is sundered,
And my soul set free;
When life’s cares and toils are numbered,
I shall haste to be
With my Lord, in realms of light,
Where no sin can ever blight,
Where ne’er comes the shades of night;
To His arms I’ll flee.
Often here I’m sad and weary,
As the days go by;
Oft the scenes are dark and dreary,
Teardrops dim my eye;
But when this short life is o’er,
We shall weep and sigh no more,
But rejoice forevermore
In our home on high.
Now I look with eager longing,
Where I soon shall stand,
Where the happy spirits thronging,
In the heav’nly band,
Taste the joys of love divine,
In refulgent glory shine—
This great heritage is mine,
In that happy land.
Shall I shrink at death’s cold river,
When on yonder shore
Stands of every good the Giver,
Whom I now adore?
Untold pleasures beckon me,
Untold joys by faith I see,
Untold happiness to be
Mine forevermore.

Earthly wealth and fame may never come to me,
And a palace fair here mine may never be;
But let come what may, if Christ for me doth care,
Anywhere is home, if He is only there.
Anywhere is home, let come and go what may;
Anywhere I roam, He keeps me all the way;
So for His dear sake, my cross I’ll meekly bear;
Anywhere is home, if Christ, my Lord, is there.
Oh, I’m tossed about and driven by the foe,
Sad within, without, wherever I may go;
But I press along, still looking up in prayer,
For it’s home, sweet home, if Christ is only there.
I will labor on till I am called away,
Till the morn shall dawn of that eternal day,
Looking unto Him who keeps me in His care;
Anywhere is home, if Christ, my Lord, is there.

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.
Anywhere with Jesus, over land and sea,
Telling souls in darkness of salvation free;
Ready as He summons me to go or stay,
Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the darkening shadows round about me creep,
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.

Approach, my soul, the mercy seat,
Where Jesus answers prayer;
There humbly fall before His feet,
For none can perish there.
Thy promise is my only plea,
With this I venture nigh;
Thou callest burdened souls to Thee,
And such, O Lord, am I.
Bowed down beneath a load of sin,
By Satan sorely pressed,
By war without and fears within,
I come to Thee for rest.
Be Thou my Shield and hiding Place,
That, sheltered by Thy side,
I may my fierce accuser face,
And tell him Thou hast died!
O wondrous love! to bleed and die,
To bear the cross and shame,
That guilty sinners, such as I,
Might plead Thy gracious Name.
“Poor tempest-tossed soul, be still;
My promised grace receive";
’Tis Jesus speaks—I must, I will,
I can, I do believe.

Are all the foes of Sion fools,
Who thus devour her saints?
Do they not know her Savior rules,
And pities her complaints?
They shall be seized with sad surprise;
For God’s revenging arm
Scatters the bones of them that rise
To do His children harm.
In vain the sons of Satan boast
Of armies in array;
When God has first despised their host
They fall an easy prey.
O for a word from Zion’s King,
Her captives to restore!
Jacob with all his tribes shall sing,
And Judah weep no more.

“Are ye able," said the Master,
“To be crucified with Me?"
“Yea," the sturdy dreamers answered,
“To the death we follow Thee."
Lord, we are able.Our spirits are Thine.
Remold them, make us, like Thee, divine.
Thy guiding radiance above us shall be
A beacon to God, to love and loyalty.
Are you able to relinquish
Purple dreams of power and fame,
To go down into the Garden,
Or to die a death of shame?
Are ye able, when the anguish
Racks your mind and heart with pain,
To forgive the souls who wrong you,
Who would make your striving vain?
Are ye able to remember,
When a thief lifts up his eyes,
That his pardoned soul is worthy
Of a place in paradise?
Are ye able when the shadows
Close around you with the sod,
To believe that spirit triumphs,
To commend your soul to God?
Are ye able? Still the Master
Whispers down eternity,
And heroic spirits answer,
Now as then in Galilee.

Are you adorning the doctrine—
The glorious doctrine of God?
Walking so holy before Him,
Following where He hath trod?
So when the world looks upon you,
Nothing but Christ is in view?
So when the world looks upon you,
Nothing but Christ is in view? 
Are you adorning the doctrine,
And making attractive the way?
Honoring Christ by your actions,
And by the words that you say?
Are you, my brother and sister,
Proving the Bible is true?
Are you, my brother and sister,
Proving the Bible is true? 
Are you adorning the doctrine,
By meekness, and love, and goodwill?
Gentleness, patience, and trueness,
Liberty’s law to fulfill?
Jesus will shine if within you, 
Showing these graces divine;
Jesus will shine if within you, 
Showing these graces divine.
If you’re adorning the doctrine,
Its beauties your soul will array;
Showers of grace will be given—
Strength from the Lord as your day.
Light from on high will be streaming
Over the pathway you tread;
Light from on high will be streaming
Over the pathway you tread.

Are you a stranger to God?
Carried away with your pride?
Tell me sinner did you ever stop to think,
Are you afraid to die?
Call on him while he is near.
Moments are swift passing by.
Will you seek him while he may be found?
Are you afraid to die?
Are you afraid, are you unsaved?
Are you afraid to die?
Are you too wicked to cry?
Would you to God’s bosom fly?
Soon he’s coming like a thief in the night,
Are you afraid to die?

Are you building on the Rock eternal?
Are you building on the sinking sand?
Are you going to that home supernal,
In that brighter, far-off, happy land? 
Are you building on the Rock?
Are you building on the Rock?
Are you building on the Rock,
Or on the sinking sand? 
Are you building on a strong foundation?
Can you stand the stormy sea of life?
’Mid the surging billows’ wild commotion,
Do you conquer in the raging strife? 
Are you building on a strong foundation,
With an anchor that will keep the soul?
Living in His love and truth unshaken,
Grounded firm and deep though billows roll? 
Are you building on a strong foundation?
Can you stand the awful judgment shock?
Are you grounded in His great salvation,
Fastened like an anchor to the Rock? 

Are you coming home, ye wandr’ers,
Whom Jesus died to win,
All footsore, lame and weary,
Your garments stained with sin;
Will you seek the blood of Jesus
To wash your garments white;
Will you trust His precious promise,
Are you coming home tonight?
Are you coming home tonight,
Are you coming home tonight,
Are you coming home to Jesus,
Out of darkness into light?
Are you coming home tonight,
Are you coming home tonight,
To your loving, heav’nly Father,
Are you coming home tonight?
Are you coming home, ye lost ones?
Behold your Lord doth wait;
Come, then no longer linger,
Come ere it be too late;
Will you come and let Him save you,
O trust His love and might;
Will you come while He is calling,
Are you coming home tonight?
Are you coming home, ye guilty,
Who bear the load of sin;
Outside you’ve long been standing,
Come now and venture in;
Will you heed the Savior’s promise,
And dare to trust Him quite;
“Come unto Me," saith Jesus,
Are you coming home tonight?

The voice of the Savior says, “Come";
The cross where He died is in sight;
E’en now at the cross there is room;
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?
The Bride and the Spirit invite;
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?
The voice of the Father implores
From mercy’s most wonderful height;
His love in that call He outpours:
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?
The voices of loved ones entreat:
You know in your heart they are right;
Then list, for the moments are fleet!
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?
The voices of friends gone before
Seem floating from regions of light;
They tenderly say o’er and o’er,
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?
O who to himself will be true,
Of all whom these voices invite?
Who answers, my brother, do you?
Are you coming to Jesus tonight?

Can the Lord count you faithful?
Is your heart true today?
Is your life pure and holy?
What does your conscience say? 
Can the Lord count on you today?
Will you His pure commands obey—
Ever keep steadfast all the way?
Can the Lord count you faithful? 
Look in the Bible, brother,
Then at the way you live:
Can the Lord as He views you
His full approval give? 
Can the dear Savior trust you,
Where’er your path may lead,
Staunchly to stand, and loyal?
Will you be His indeed? 
“Faithful to death," the motto
Shines on our banners high;
Faithful to Christ forever,
This is our battle cry.

Are you happy in the Lord,
Tell it out with gladness;
Are you trusting in His Word,
Tell it out with gladness;
If a Savior’s love you feel,
Can your soul its power conceal?
To the world your joy reveal,
Tell it out with gladness.
Tell it out, tell it out with gladness,
Tell it out, tell it out with gladness,
Tell the world the joy you feel,
Tell it out, tell it out with gladness.
Are you walking in the light,
Tell it out with gladness;
Is your hope of glory bright,
Tell it out with gladness;
Have you perfect peace within,
Are you trying still to win
Constant victory over sin,
Tell it out with gladness.
Do you love the place of prayer,
Tell it out with gladness;
Do you find a blessing there,
Tell it out with gladness;
While your thoughts on Jesus dwell,
Does your soul with rapture swell?
Can you say that all is well?
Tell it out with gladness.

Without holiness no man shall see the Lord,
Thus it is written in His holy word;
Ye must be purified and cleansed from sin
If the courts of heaven you would enter in.
We must be clean,
Pure in His sight,
Cleansed from all sin,
Spotless and white.
Without sinful spot your soul indeed must be
If you would dwell with Christ eternally;
None but the pure in heart shall enter rest,
When the books are opened for the final test.
Without holiness your life were spent in vain,
Though a profession you may yet maintain;
Naught but the life of Christ within the soul
Will avail to help you reach the final goal.
He will surely keep you pure and white within,
Give you dominion over every sin;
But if you still refuse His wondrous grace,
You will flee in terror from before His face.

Do you hear the Savior calling,
By the wooings of His voice?
Do you hear the accents falling?
Will you make the precious choice?
Are you listening? Are you listening?
Now, to hear the accents fall?
Are you listening? Are you listening
To the Savior’s gentle call?
By the word of truth He’s speaking
To the wandr’ing, erring ones;
List! the voice the stillness breaking!
Hear the sweet and solemn tones!
In His providential dealings,
Even in His stern decrees,
In the loudest thunders pealing,
Or the murm’ring of the breeze.

Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready to meet Jesus?
Are you where you ought to be?
Will He know you when He sees you
Or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Are you ready,
hope you're ready.
Am I ready?
Am I ready?
Am I ready?
Am I ready?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
And to take up my cross?
Have I surrendered to the will of God
Or am I still acting like the boss?
Am I ready, hope I'm ready.
When destruction cometh swiftly
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Have you decided whether you want to be
In heaven or in hell?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Have you got some unfinished business?
Is there something holding you back?
Are you thinking for yourself
Or are you following the pack?
Are you ready for the judgment?
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?
Are you ready for Armageddon?
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?

Are you ready for the coming of the Lord from Heav’n?
Are you resting in the promise which to us is giv’n?
Does your heart leap up with rapture as you know He’s near?
Or do thoughts of His appearing fill your heart with fear?
Are you ready (are you ready),
Are you ready (are you ready),
Are you ready for the opening skies?
Are you ready (are you ready),
Are you ready (are you ready),
Are you ready for that glad surprise?
If He came to call His people would you be dismayed?
Though your sins have been forgiven would you be afraid?
Would you be ashamed to meet Him if He came today?
From the presence of the Master would you shrink away?
To this world with all its pleasures are you rooted fast?
Would a call to leave it quickly be a wrench at last?
When He views your finished life work will you suffer loss?
Will you find that you have gathered only worthless dross?
Are you busy in His service though your heart is cold?
Are there precious earthly treasures which you fondly hold?
Would He find you doing only what He could approve?
Would He find you watching, waiting for the One you love?

Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother,
In the morning bright and fair?
Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother,
In the heat of the noonday’s glare?
For the harvest time is coming on,
And the reapers’ work will soon be done;
Will your sheaves be many? Will you garner any
For the gathering at the harvest home?
Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, sister,
In the still and solemn night?
Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, sister,
For a harvest pure and white?
Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother,
All along the fertile way?
Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, sister?
You must reap at the last great day!

Are you trusting Jesus,
All along the way?
Does He grow more precious
To your heart each day?
Are you His disciple?
Test His Word and see,
He will give the Spirit more abundantly.
More abundantly,
More abundantly,
“That they might have life
And more abundantly";
More abundantly,
More abundantly,
“That they might have life
And more abundantly."
For His matchless favor,
Magnify the Name
Of our gracious Savior
Who from glory came;
Let the saints adore Him
For this wondrous Word,
Sealing our redemption thro’ the crimson flood.
Come to Him believing,
Hearken to His call;
All from Him receiving,
Yield to Him your all;
Jesus will accept you
When to Him you flee;
He will grant His blessing more abundantly.

On your journey to the grave
Would you stop and try to save
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
Would you lend a helping hand
To some poor sinner man
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
Are you walkin', (are you walkin')
Are you talkin', (are you talkin')
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
Are you traveling in his light
Ev'ry day and ev'ry night
Are you walkin' and a talkin' with the Lord?
If you heart said testify, would the world hear your reply
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?.
Would you stand and shout His name or bow your head in shame
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
When the time has come to go, will your robe be white as snow
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?
Will He take you by the hand and lead you to that promised land
Are you walkin' and a-talkin' with the Lord?

Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you washed in the blood,
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you walking daily by the Savior’s side?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;
There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
O be washed in the blood of the Lamb!

Are you weary, are you heavy hearted?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.
Are you grieving over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone.
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a Friend that’s well known.
You’ve no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.
Do the tears flow down your cheeks unbidden?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.
Have you sins that to men’s eyes are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone.
Do you fear the gathering clouds of sorrow?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.
Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?
Tell it to Jesus alone.
Are you troubled at the thought of dying?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.
For Christ’s coming kingdom are you sighing?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

Are you working for the Master,
Are you toiling day by day?
Are you sowing seeds of kindness,
For the reapers on the way?
Hear you not the Master calling,
For glad toilers brave and true?
Will you enter now the harvest,
For the call is unto you?
There’s a work for all, my brother,
Sheaves are falling by the way,
Go you forth into the harvest,
Enter now, without delay.

For You are good, Your love endures forever
And we rejoice in Your unfailing love.
Consume our praise with fire down from heaven
And fill us with Your power from above.
Arise, arise, arise
Oh Lord, our God, arise!
Arise, oh Lord, within our midst
As we declare Your righteousness;
Lift up the name that we confess
As we proclaim Your holiness.
Salvation comes from You alone
Oh Lamb of God, the chosen One.
That we might be Your resting place
We worship You, we seek Your face.

Arise, all souls, arise! The watch is past;
A glory breaks above the cloud at last.
There comes a rushing mighty wind again!
The breath of God is still the life of men;
The day ascending fills the waiting skies,
All souls, arise!
It comes the breath of God through all the skies!
To live, to breathe with Him, all souls, arise!
Open the windows toward the shining East;
Call in the guests, and spread a wider feast,
The Lord pours forth as sacramental wine
His breath divine!
It comes a larger life, a deeper breath;
Arise, all souls, arise, and conquer death!
Spread forth the feast, the dew and manna fall
And angels whisper, “Drink ye of it all;
Drink of His truth, and feed upon His love,
With saints above!"
Arise, all souls, arise, to meet your Guest!
His light flames from the East unto the West.
The Lord of earth and Heaven is at the door,
He comes to break His bread to all His poor;
Arise and serve with Him, His moment flies;
All souls arise!

Arise! arise, with joy survey
The glory of the latter day;
Already is the dawn begun,
Which marks at hand a rising sun,
Which marks at hand a rising sun.
“Behold the way!" ye heralds, cry;
Spare not, but lift your voices high;
Convey the sound from pole to pole,
“Glad tidings" to the captive soul,
“Glad tidings" to the captive soul.
“Behold the way!" to Zion’s hill:
Where Israel’s God delights to dwell!
He fixes there His lofty throne,
And calls the sacred place His own,
And calls the sacred place His own.
The north gives up—the south no more
Keeps back her consecrated store;
From east to west the message runs,
And either India yields her sons,
And either India yields her sons.

Arise, come ye forth, and forever break the chain,
That long had oppressed you with sorrow and pain;
Arise, come ye forth, hear the blessed Lord’s command,
And He Himself will guide you with a strong, strong hand.
Come forth, come forth, and shout the jubilee,
Come forth, come forth, the Lord will make you free;
Come forth from your bonds, hear the blessed Lord’s command,
And He Himself will guide you with a strong, strong hand.
Arise, come ye forth; will ye spend your life for naught,
When Jesus Who loves you a ransom has bought?
The price of His blood, O receive it while you may;
Behold the promised time is now; O come away.
Arise, come ye forth, and be slaves to sin no more,
How oft your Deliv’rer has called you before;
Come forth from your bonds, and your liberty receive,
Your willing hearts to Jesus give; repent, believe.

Weary, lonely, sad, forsaken,
Humbled to a station low,
Sat a hopeless blind man begging,
By the road to Jericho.
Soon he heard the noise of footsteps,
As of waters rolling nigh;
For the Galilean Prophet
With the throng was passing by.
Then arise, He calleth thee,
Sick or suff’ring, blind or lame!
Jesus healed in Galilee,
He is evermore the same.
When he heard that it was Jesus,
Who had healed the sin-sick soul,
Then he called aloud for mercy,
That he, too, might be made whole.
But the multitude rebuked him,
Saying he should silent be;
Yet he only called more loudly,
“Have compassion, Lord, on me!" 
Paused the Master for a moment—
“Bring him hither unto Me."
Someone ran to bear the message:
“Come, arise, He calleth thee!"
Oh, what words of cheer and comfort!
What today could sweeter be
To the weary, sick, and suff’ring—
“Come, arise, He calleth thee"? 
Then as he approached the Master,
Healing virtue to receive,
Jesus said, “Thy faith hath saved thee,
Be it as thou dost believe."
And the blind man’s eyes were opened,
He had proved the promise true;
Ye, who still in sickness languish,
Lo, the Master calls for you.

NOT A WORD WAS HEARD AT THE TOMB THAT DAY
JUST SHUFFLING SOLDIERS FEET AS THEY GUARDED THE GRAVE
ONE DAY TWO DAYS THREE DAYS HAD PASSED
COULD IT BE THAT JESUS HAD BREATHED HIS LAST
COULD IT BE THAT HIS FATHER HAD FORSAKEN HIM
TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS SON DESPISING OUR SIN
ALL HELL SEEMED TO WHISPER JUST FORGET IT HE'S DEAD
THEN THE FATHER LOOKED DOWN TO HIS SON AND SAID
ARISE MY LOVE ARISE MY LOVE
THE GRAVE NO LONGER HAS A HOLD ON YOU
NO MORE DEATH'S STING NO MORE SUFFERING
ARISE ARISE MY LOVE (ARISE-LAST TIME)
THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE TOMB BEGAN TO SHAKE
AND LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN THE STONE WAS ROLLED AWAY
AND AS DEAD MEN THE GUARDS THEY ALL STOOD THERE IN FRIGHT
AS THE POWER OF LOVE DISPLAYED IT'S MIGHT
THEN SUDDENLY A MELODY FILLED THE AIR
RIDING WINGS OF WIND IT WAS EVERYWHERE
THE WORDS THAT CREATION HAD BEEN LONGING TO HEAR
THE SWEET SOUND OF VICTORY SO LOUD AND CLEAR
SIN WHERE ARE YOUR SHACKLES DEATH WHERE IS YOUR STING

Arise, my soul, arise; shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice in my behalf appears:
Before the throne my surety stands,
Before the throne my surety stands,
My name is written on His hands.
He ever lives above, for me to intercede;
His all redeeming love, His precious blood, to plead:
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.
Five bleeding wounds He bears; received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me:
“Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
“Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
“Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"
The Father hears Him pray, His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away, the presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.
My God is reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And “Father, Abba, Father," cry.

Arise, my soul, my joyful powers,
And triumph in my God;
Awake, my voice, and loud proclaim
His glorious grace abroad.
He raised me from the deeps of sin,
The gates of gaping hell,
And fixed my standing more secure
Than ’twas before I fell.
The arms of everlasting love
Beneath my soul He placed;
And on the Rock of ages set
My slippery footsteps fast.
The city of my blessed abode
Is walled around with grace,
Salvation for a bulwark stands
To shield the sacred place.
Satan may vent his sharpest spite,
And all his legions roar;
Almighty mercy guards my life,
And bounds his raging power.
Arise, my soul; awake, my voice,
And tunes of pleasure sing;
Loud hallelujahs shall address
My Savior and my King.

Arise my soul and greet 
him, the Lord who reigns on high.
Sing out your praises loudly, let triumph fill the sky.
He chose me and he saved me, from darkness and despair, 
He knew me and he loved me, before I had a care.
I'll stand to greet my maker, He formed me out of dust, 
Since life began I've wandered, 
not knowing whom to trust.
Not worthy of the mercy, 
that Christ bestowed on me, 
I'll rise and Praise the Lord now, 
His grace has set me free.
My God has saved me fully, 
now I will always be, 
His servant and His worker, 
whose sights are set on He.
Now that my soul's been pardoned, 
for sins beyond degree, 
I'll fight the fight till death comes, 
Then live eternally.

Arise, my tend’rest thoughts, arise,
To torrents melt my streaming eyes;
And thou, my heart, with anguish feel
Those evils which thou canst not heal.
See human nature sunk in shame!
See scandals poured on Jesus’ Name!
The Father wounded thro’ the Son;
The world abused, the soul undone!
See the short course of vain delight,
Closing in everlasting night—
In flames that no abatement know,
Tho’ briny tears forever flow.
My God, I feel the mournful scene!
My bowels yearn o’er dying men!
And fain my pity would reclaim
And snatch the firebrands from the flame.

Arise, O God, and shine
In all Thy saving might,
And prosper each design
To spread Thy glorious light;
Let healing streams of mercy flow
That all the earth Thy truth may know.
Bring distant nations near
To sing Thy glorious praise;
Let every people hear
And learn Thy holy ways.
Reign, mighty God, assert Thy cause
And govern by Thy righteous laws.
Put forth Thy glorious power
That Gentiles all may see
And earth present her store
In converts born to Thee.
God, our own God, His Church will bless
And fill the world with righteousness.
To God, the only Wise,
The one immortal King,
Let hallelujahs rise
From every living thing;
Let all that breathe, on every coast
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Arise, O Lord, our God, arise
And enter now into Thy rest;
O let this house be Thine abode,
Forever with Thy presence blest.
Thy gracious cov’nant, Lord, fulfill,
Turn not away from us Thy face;
Establish Thou Messiah’s throne
And let Him reign within this place.
Thy Zion Thou hast chosen, Lord,
And Thou hast said, I love her well,
This is My constant resting place,
And here will I delight to dwell.
I will abundantly provide
For Zion’s good, the Lord hath said;
I will supply her daily need
And satisfy her poor with bread.

Arise, sons of the kingdom!
The King is drawing nigh;
Arise, and hail with gladness
The Ruler from on high.
Ye Christians, hasten forth!
Your praise and homage bring Him
And glad hosannas sing Him,
Naught else your love is worth.
Arise, ye drooping mourners!
The King is very near;
Away with grief and sorrow,
For lo! your Help is here.
Behold, in many a place—
We find Him, our Salvation,
O blessed consolation!
In His pure means of grace.
Arise, ye much afflicted!
The King is now not far;
Rejoice, ye long dejected!
Here comes the Morning Star.
The Lord will give you joy;
Though troubles now distress you,
With comfort He will bless you,
E’en death He will destroy.
Now hear, ye bold transgressors,
The King does well give heed
To all that ye are doing,
And to the life ye lead,
Enthralled to sin and hell;
Nothing in all creation
Escapes His observation
He marketh all things well.
Be righteous, ye His subjects,
The King is just and true;
Prepare for Him a highway,
Make all things straight and new.
He means all for our good
Then let us bear our crosses
That He Himself imposes,
In an undaunted mood.
Though war and conflagration
Take all our goods away;
The Lord is our salvation
And heritage for aye.
E’en though our loved ones die,
Yet they are not forsaken,
But from this world are taken
To live with God on high
Arise, ye poor and needy!
The King provides for you;
He comes with succor speedy,
With mercy ever new.
He Who a beast did heed
Lets not His children perish;
All hopes that man may cherish
He can fulfill indeed.
He nevermore forsaketh
A child that feels the rod,
Who Him his refuge maketh,
And puts his trust in God.
He is our sovereign King;
E’en death itself shall never
Those from their Master sever
Who to His mercy cling.
Arise, ye faint and fearful!
The King now comes with might,
His heart hath long since loved us,
He makes our darkness light.
Now are our sorrows o’er;
No wrath shall e’er befall us,
Since God in grace doth call us
His children evermore.
Haste then, with eager footsteps,
To see your Sovereign there!
He rides as King of Zion,
Strong, glorious, meek and fair.
Draw near the Lord and give
To Him your salutation,
Who bringeth great salvation,
And bids the sinner live.
The King in grace remembers
His loved ones here below
With gifts of royal treasures,
Yea, doth Himself bestow
Through His blest Word and grace.
O King, arrayed in splendor,
To Thee all praise we’ll render
Here and there face to face.
O rich the gifts Thou bring’st us,
Thyself made poor and weak;
O Love beyond expression
That thus can sinners seek!
For this, O Lord, will we
Our joyous tribute bring Thee,
And glad hosannas sing Thee,
And ever grateful be.

Arise, the kingdom is at hand,
The King is drawing nigh;
Arise with joy, thou faithful band,
To meet the Lord most high!
Look up, ye souls, weighed down with care,
The Sovereign is not far;
Look up, faint hearts, from your despair,
Behold the Morning Star!
Look up, ye drooping hearts, today,
The King is very near;
O cast your griefs and fears away,
For, lo, your help is here!
Hope on, ye broken hearts, at last
The King comes in His might;
He loved us in the ages past
When we lay wrapped in night.
Look up, ye souls weighed down with care,
The Sovereign is not far!
Look up, faint hearts, from your despair,
Behold the Morning Star!
The Lord is with us now, Who shall
The sinking spirit feed
With strength and comfort at its need
To Whom e’en death shall bow.
Hope, O ye broken hearts, at last!
The King comes on in might,
He loved us in the ages past
When we sat wrapped in night;
Now are our sorrows o’er, and fear
And wrath to joy give place,
Since God hath made us in His grace
His children evermore.
O rich the gifts Thou bringest us,
Thyself made poor and weak;
O love beyond compare that thus
Can foes and sinners seek!
For this we raise a gladsome voice
On high to Thee alone,
And evermore with thanks rejoice
Before Thy glorious throne.

Arise! Obey! And follow God! 
Upon these feet which he hath shod.
He guards us with his heavenly sword, 
Which is his own, almighty Word.
But do we thank him for his deeds? 
For tending to our every need? 
No, we think we had all the wit, 
And our Lord Jesus we emit.
The mocker pride’s our sure demise.
Why listen to the devil’s lies? 
For pride will come before a fall, 
Oh, sinner listen to my call! 
The dragon pride, creeps in on us; 
What happened to our selflessness? 
We need to see that we are low, 
Arise! Obey! to God follow! 

Arm of the Lord, awake, awake!
Put on Thy strength, the nations shake,
And let the world, adoring, see
Triumphs of mercy wrought by Thee.
Say to the heathen from Thy throne,
“I am Jehovah, God alone";
Thy voice their idols shall confound,
And cast their altars to the ground.
No more let creature blood be spilt,
Vain sacrifice for human guilt!
But to each conscience be applied
The blood that flowed from Jesus’ side.
Let Zion’s time of favor come;
O bring the tribes of Israel home;
And let our wondering eyes behold
Gentiles and Jews in Jesus’ fold.
Almighty God, Thy grace proclaim
In every clime of every name;
Let adverse powers before Thee fall,
And crown the Savior Lord of all.

Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,
With shield of faith and Spirit’s sword.
Forth to the battle may they go
And boldly fight against the foe.
With banner of the cross unfurled,
They overcome the evil world
And so at last receive from Thee
The palm and crown of victory.
Come, ever blessed Spirit, come
And make Thy servants’ heart Thy home.
May each a living temple be
Hallowed forever, Lord, to Thee.
Enrich that temple’s holy shrine
With sevenfold gifts of grace divine;
With wisdom, light, and knowledge bless,
With counsel, strength, and godliness.
O Trinity in Unity,
One only God in Persons Three,
In Whom, through Whom, by Whom, we live,
To Thee we praise and glory give.
Oh, grant us so to use Thy grace
That we may see Thy glorious face
And ever with the heavenly host
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost!

If I had to live one day without You
I know that it's something I could not do.
Accustomed to talking to You every day,
You're never more than an arm's length away.
Lord, guide my feet down life's narrow way,
And open my heart to Your love each day.
And Lord, let my eyes from You never stray,
And never be more than an arm's length away.
You took me in like a child from the cold.
You warmed my heart with a love untold.
I walk in Your footprints, I try every day
To never be more than an arm's length away.
Lord, guide my feet down life's narrow way,
And open my heart to Your love each day.
And Lord, let my eyes from You never stray,
And never be more than an arm's length away.
Lord, guide my feet down life's narrow way,
And open my heart to Your love each day.
And Lord, let my eyes from You never stray,
And never be more than an arm's length away.
Lord, guide my feet down life's narrow way,
And open my heart to Your love each day.
And Lord, let my eyes from You never stray,
And never be more than an arm's length away

Army of Endeavor, bear the trumpet call;
’Gainst the foe advancing, forward one and all!
Christ is our Commander; faithful let us be:
He will give to us the victory!
Though the battle rages, what have we to fear?
In the wildest conflict, He is ever near.
Trusting in our Leader, faithful let us be:
He will give the victory!
In His royal service, there’s a work for all,
Cheering on the faint ones, lifting those that fall;
Unto Him Who calls us ever faithful be:
He will give to us the victory!
Ever pressing onward in the cause of right,
Holding up the banner, walking in the light;
Keeping His commandments, great rewards have we!
He will give to us the victory!

ARE WE WALKIN' INTO THE ENEMIES CAMP, LAYIN' OUR WEAPONS DOWN
SHEDIN' OUR ARMOR AS WE GO, LEAVIN' IT ON THE GROUND
WE'VE GOTTA BE STRONG IN THE POWER OF HIS MIGHT, PROVE TO THE ENEMY
WE ARE THE ARMY OF THE LORD, AND WE'VE WON THE VICTORY
V1
ALL AROUND US A WAR IS GOIN' ON, BETWEEN THE WRONG AND THE RIGHT
WE'VE GOT TO CHOOSE WHICH SIDE WE'RE ON, THE DARKNESS OR THE LIGHT
AND SOME OF THE SOLDIERS OF THE LORD, JUST DON'T REALIZE
THAT THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY OF DARKNESS HAS COME TO BLIND THEIR EYES

CAN'T YOU SEE THAT WE'RE IN BATTLE, THERE'S NO PLACE TO HIDE
OUR SHIELDS OF FAITH ARE FULL OF DARTS, SHOOTING FROM EVERY SIDE
JUST SHAKE OUT THE DARTS AND RUN RIGHT AT EM
AND REMEMBER WHO YOUR FIGHTIN FOR
DON'T FALL ASLEEP 'CAUSE IF THEY CATCH YA THEY'LL TAG YA PRISONER OF WAR

Around the Savior’s lofty throne
Ten thousand times ten thousand sing;
They worship Him as God alone,
And crown Him—everlasting King.
Approach, ye saints! this God is yours;
’Tis Jesus fills the throne above:
Ye cannot want while God endures;
Ye cannot fail while God is love.
Jesus, Thou everlasting King!
To Thee the praise of Heaven belongs;
Yet, smile on us who fain would bring
The tribute of our humble songs.
Though sin defile our worship here,
We hope ere long Thy face to view;
And when our souls in Heaven appear,
We’ll praise Thy Name as angels do.

Around the throne of God
The host angelic throngs;
They spread their palms abroad,
And shout perpetual songs:
Him first they own, Him last and best;
God ever blest, and God alone.
Their golden crowns they fling
Before His throne of light,
And strike the rapturous string,
Unceasing, day and night:
“Earth, Heav’n, and sea, Thy praise declare;
For Thine they are, and Thine shall be.
“O holy, holy, Lord,
Creation’s sovereign King!
Thy majesty adored
Let all creation sing;
Who wast, and art, and art to be;
Nor time shall see Thy sway depart.
“Great are Thy works of praise,
O God of boundless might;
All just and true Thy ways,
Thou King of saints, in light:
Let all above, and all below,
Conspire to show Thy power and love.
“Who shall not fear Thee, Lord,
And magnify Thy Name?
Thy judgments, sent abroad,
Thy holiness proclaim:
Nations shall throng from every shore,
And all adore in one loud song."
While thus the powers on high
Their swelling raise,
Let earth and man reply,
And echo back the praise:
His glory own, first, last and best;
God ever blest, and God alone.

Around the throne of God a band
Of bright and glorious angels stand;
Sweet harps within their hands they hold,
And on their heads are crowns of gold.
Some wait around Him ready still
To sing His praise and do His will,
And some, when He commands them, go
To guard His servants here below.
Lord, give Thine angels every day
Command to guard us on our way,
And bid them every evening keep
Their watch around us while we sleep.
So shall no wicked thing draw near
To do us harm or cause us fear;
And we shall dwell, when life is past,
With angels round Thy throne at last.

Around the throne of God in Heaven,
Thousands of children stand,
Children whose sins are all forgiven,
A holy, happy band,
Singing, “Glory, glory,
Glory be to God on high."
In flowing robes of spotless white
See everyone arrayed;
Dwelling in everlasting light
And joys that never fade,
What brought them to the world above,
That Heaven so bright and fair,
Where all is peace, and joy, and love;
How came those children there,
Because the Savior shed His blood
To wash away their sin;
Bathed in that pure and precious flood,
Behold them white and clean,
On earth they sought the Savior’s grace,
On earth they loved His Name;
So now they see His blessed face,
And stand before the Lamb,

Why pour'st thou forth thine anxious plaint,
Despairing of relief,
As if the Lord o'erlooked thy cause,
And did not heed thy grief?
Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard,
That firm remains on high
The everlasting throne of Him
Who formed the earth and sky?
Art thou afraid his pow'r shall fail
When comes thy evil day?
And can an all-creating arm
Grow weary or decay?
Supreme in wisdom as in pow'r
The Rock of ages stands;
Though him thou canst not see,
nor trace The working of his hands.
He gives the conquest to the weak,
Supports the fainting heart;
And courage in the evil hour
His heav'nly aids impart.
Mere human pow'r shall fast decay,
And youthful vigor cease;
But they who wait upon the Lord,
In strength shall still increase.
They with unwearied feet shall tread
The path of life divine;
With growing ardor onward move,
With growing brightness shine.
On eagles' wings they mount, they soar,
Their wings are faith and love,
Till, past the cloudy regions here,
They rise to heav'n above.

Art thou weary, art thou languid,
Art thou sore distressed?
“Come to Me," saith One, “and coming,
Be at rest."
Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my Guide?
In His feet and hands are wound prints
And His side.
Hath He diadem, as monarch,
That His brow adorns?
Yes, a crown in very surety,
But of thorns.
If I find Him, if I follow,
What His guerdon here?
Many a sorrow, many a labor,
Many a tear.
If I still hold closely to Him,
What hath He at last?
Sorrow vanquished, labor ended,
Jordan passed.
If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay?
Not till earth and not till Heaven
Pass away.
Finding, following, keeping, struggling,
Is He sure to bless?
Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs,
Answer, Yes!

As a tree beside the water,
Has the Savior planted me;
All my fruit shall be in season,
I shall live eternally.
I shall not be moved,
I shall not be moved,
Anchored to the Rock of Ages,
I shall not be moved.
Though the tempest rage around me,
Through the storm my Lord I see,
Pointing upward to that haven,
Where my loved ones wait for me.
When by grief my heart is broken,
And the sunshine steals away,
Then His grace, in mercy given,
Changes darkness into day.
When at last I stand before Him,
Oh, what joy it will afford,
Just to see the sinner ransomed,
And behold my sovereign Lord.

A call for loyal soldiers
Comes to one and all;
Soldiers for the conflict,
Will you heed the call?
Will you answer quickly,
With a ready cheer,
Will you be enlisted
As a volunteer?
A volunteer for Jesus,
A soldier true!
Others have enlisted,
Why not you?
Jesus is the Captain,
We will never fear,
Will you be enlisted
As a volunteer?
Yes, Jesus calls for soldiers
Who are filled with pow’r,
Soldiers who will serve Him
Ev’ry day and hour;
He will not forsake you,
He is ever near;
Will you be enlisted
As a volunteer?
He calls you, for He loves you
With a heart most kind,
He Whose heart was broken,
Broken for mankind;
Now, just now, He calls you,
Calls in accents clear,
Will you be enlisted
As a volunteer?
And when the war is over,
And the vict’ry won,
When the true and faithful
Gather one by one,
He will crown with glory
All who there appear;
Will you be enlisted
As a volunteer?

As above the darkest storm cloud
Shines the sun, serenely bright
Waiting to restore to nature
All the glory of his light,
So, behind each cloud of sorrow,
So, in each affliction, stands,
Hid, an angel, with a blessing
From the Father in his hand.
As without the tempest, pouring
O’er the earth the welcome rain,
All were but a fruitless desert,
Barren sand for ripen’ng grain,
So if ne’er a cloud of sadness
Veiled the sunshine of the soul,
If affliction’s waves were never
Suffered o’er the heart to roll.
Love and faith might fail forever
To bring forth their fruits of peace;
Heaven’s good seed of truth would perish
In a thorny wilderness.
So, with cloud and storm and tempest
Grows our earthly summer dim,
That the rebel heart, our Father
Thus may win to turn to Him.

As birds their infant brood protect,
And spread their wings to shelter them,
Thus saith the Lord to His elect,
“So will I guard Jerusalem."
And what then is Jerusalem,
This darling object of His cares?
Where is its worth in God’s esteem?
Who built it? Who inhabits there?
Jehovah founded it in blood,
The blood of His incarnate Son;
There dwell the saints, once foes to God
The sinners whom He calls His own.
There, though besieged on every side,
Yet much beloved and guarded well,
From age to age they have defied
The utmost force of earth and hell.
Let earth repent, and hell despair,
This city has a sure defense;
Her name is called, “The Lord is there,"
And who has power to drive Him hence?

AS DAVID DID IN JEHOVAH'S SIGHT
I WILL DANCE WITH ALL MY MIGHT
BEFORE THE KING OF KINGS
AS MIRIAM DID WITH THE TAMBOURINE
I WILL CLAP MY HANDS AND SING
BEFORE THE KING OF KINGS
WE CAN COME BEFORE HIM
AND WORSHIP HIM TODAY
WE CAN NOW ADORE HIM
JESUS MADE THE WAY
AS JUDAH DID ON THE BATTLEGROUND
WE WILL MAKE A JOYFUL SOUND
BEFORE THE KING OF KINGS
AS JOSHUA DID AT JERICHO
WE WILL SHOUT AND DEFEAT THE FOE
BEFORE THE KING OF KINGS

As each happy Christmas
Dawns on earth again,
Comes the holy Christ Child
To the hearts of men.
Enters with His blessing
Into every home,
Guides and guards our footsteps,
As we go and come.
All unknown, beside me,
He will ever stand,
And will safely lead me
With His own right hand.

You make my joy complete
as I abide in You
You fill my every need
as I abide in You
I will remain in You for all of my days
You will shelter me as I give you praise
I will sing of your love
I will bring all of my love
You answer every prayer
as I abide in You
I feel your love and care
as I abide in You

As I journey thro’ the land, singing as I go,
Pointing souls to Calvary—to the crimson flow,
Many arrows pierce my soul from without, within;
But my Lord leads me on, thro’ Him I must win.
O I want to see Him, look upon His face,
There to sing forever of His saving grace;
On the streets of glory let me lift my voice,
Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.
When in service for my Lord dark may be the night,
But I’ll cling more close to Him, He will give me light;
Satan’s snares may vex my soul, turn my tho’ts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead, leads whate’er betide.
When in valleys low I look tow’rd the mountain height,
And behold my Savior there, leading in the fight,
With a tender hand outstretched tow’rd the valley low,
Guiding me, I can see, as I onward go.
When before me billows rise form the mighty deep,
Then my Lord directs my bark; He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on thro’ this world below;
He’s a real Friend to me, O I love Him so.

As I lay down in peace,
upon my bed to sleep
God's Spirit covers over me
as I lay down in peace
Safe and set apart,
with gladness in my heart
Trusting in God's love for me,
resting in His Word
As I lay down in peace,
upon my bed to sleep
God's Spirit covers over me
as I lay down in peace
God's Spirit covers over me
as I lay down in peace

As it fell out upon one day,
Rich Dives made a feast,
And he invited all his friends,
And gentry of the best.
Then Lazarus laid him down and down
And down at Dives’ door:
“Some meat and drink, brother, Diverus,
Bestow upon the poor."
“Thou’rt none of my brothers, Lazarus,
That liest begging at my door;
No meat, nor drink will I give thee,
Nor bestow upon the poor."
Then Lazarus laid him down and down,
All under Dives’ wall:
“Some meat, some drink, brother Diverus,
For hunger starve I shall."
“Thou’rt none of my brothers, Lazarus,
That liest begging at my gate;
No meat, no drink will I give thee,
For Jesus Christ His sake."
Then Dives sent out his hungry dogs,
To bite him as he lay;
They hadn’t the power to bite one bite,
But licked his sores away.
Then Dives sent to his merry men,
To worry poor Lazarus away;
They’d not the power to strike one stroke,
But flung their whips away.
As it fell out upon one day,
Poor Lazarus sickened and died;
There came two angels out of heaven,
His soul therein to guide.
“Rise up! rise up! brother Lazarus,
And go along with me;
For you’ve a place prepared in heaven,
To sit on an angel’s knee."
As it fell out upon one day,
Rich Dives sickened and died;
There came two serpents out of hell,
His soul therein to guide.
“Rise up! rise up! brother Diverus,
And come along with me;
There is a place provided in hell
For wicked men like thee."
Then Dives looked up with his eyes
And saw poor Lazarus blest;
“Give me one drop of water, brother Lazarus,
To quench my flaming thirst."
“O, was I now but alive again
The space of one half hour!
O, that I had my peace again
Then the devil should have no power."

As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
at night on a stone for a pillow he lay;
he saw in a vision a ladder so high,
that its foot was on earth and its top in the sky:
 Alleluia to Jesus, who died on the tree
and has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,
and has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.
The ladder is long, it is strong and well-made,
has stood hundreds of years and is not yet decayed;
many millions have climbed it and reached Zion's hill,
many millions by faith now are climbing it still.
Come, let us ascend! All may climb it who will,
for the angels of Jacob are guarding it still;
and remember, each step that by faith we pass o'er,
many prophets and martyrs have trod it before.
And when we arrive at the haven of rest,
we shall hear the glad words, "Come to me all the blest,
here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss."
Who would not want to climb such a ladder as this.

As Jonah, issuing from his three days’ tomb,
At length was cast, uninjured, on the earth;
So, from the virgin’s unpolluted womb
Th’incarnate Word, That dwelt there, had His birth:
For He, Who knew no taint of mortal stain,
Willed that His mother spotless should remain.
Christ comes, incarnate God, amongst us now,
Begotten of the Father ere the day:
And He, to Whom the sinless legions bow,
Lies cradled, ’midst unconscious beasts on hay:
And, by His homely swaddling-bands girt in,
Looses the many fetters of our sin.
Now the new Child of Adam’s race draws nigh,
To us, the faithful, giv’n: This, this is He
That shall the Father of eternity,
The Angel of the Mighty Counsel, be:
This the eternal God, by Whose strong hands
The fabric of the world supported stands.

As light, O Christ, Thou cam’st to earth;
In Thee I live, in Thee I shall arise;
Thou art my joy, Thou my new birth,
To blessed life Thou openest mine eyes.
For me Thou to the cross didst go,
For me Thou gav’st Thy blood to flow.
For me, in dark Gethsemane
Alone Thou, Christ, with sin and death didst fight;
Alone with God didst plead for me,
That I in Thee might see the blessed light.
From all my heart, while I may live,
Eternal thanks to Thee I’ll give.

As long as I have breath, I will praise You Lord
As long as I can sing, I will sing Your praise
Wherever You lead me, I will follow You
As long as I have breath, I will praise You Lord 
As long as I have breath, I will praise You Lord
As long as I can sing, I will sing Your praise
Wherever You lead me, I will follow You
As long as I have breath, I will praise You Lord 
As long as I have breath, I will praise You Lord
As long as I have breath, I will praise You Lord
As long as I have breath, I will praise You Lord

It doesn't matter if I'm all alone
As long as I'm with Jesus
It doesn't matter if I'm weak or strong
As long as I'm with Jesus
Young or old, high or low
Wherever I am and wherever I go
It doesn't matter to me, 
As long as I'm with Jesus
In this life of trouble
In this world of sorrow
Somehow I wonder how I'll make it through the day
And how I'm going to face tomorrow
But Jesus loves me this I know
For the Bible tells me so
What else can I need
What else can I want to know

As man and woman we were made
That love be found and life begun,
So praise the Lord Who made us two,
And praise the Lord when two are one;
Praise for the love that comes to life
Through child or parent, husband, wife.
Now Jesus lived and gave His love
To make our life and loving new;
So celebrate with Him today
And drink the joy He offers you;
That makes the simple moment shine
And changes water into wine.
And Jesus died to live again,
So praise the love that, come what may,
Can bring the dawn and clear the skies,
And waits to wipe all tears away;
And let us hope for what shall be,
Believing where we cannot see.
Then spread the table, clear the hall,
And celebrate till day is done;
Let peace go deep between us all
And joy be shared by everyone;
Laugh and make merry with your friends,
And praise the love that never ends!

As men seek for hidden treasure,
As for rain thirsts the drying sod,
As the hart pants after water,
So my heart pants after God.
I seek not for worldly pleasure,
I pray not for earthly store;
My whole soul goes after Jesus—
I am seeking nothing more.
Oh, to be holy, holy, holy,
Like my Savior every day,
To be filled with all His fullness,
’Tis for this I pray and pray.

As near the wished for port we draw
We lift our hearts in praise to Thee,
Almighty Father, loving Lord,
Our Pilot on the troubled sea.
By Thy good care in peace we come,
From fire and foe securely kept,
And after tempest, at Thy word,
The waves have laid them down and slept.
As Thou hast giv’n us outward calm,
So, Lord, within us may there be
A peace divine, a peace in Him,
Through Whom alone we live to Thee.
Give us more light, direct our course,
Cleanse us from guile, our hearts renew;
Let not dark clouds of sin shut out
The star of Jesus from our view.
And then, our long life voyage o’er,
And past the perils of the sea,
Receive us on the blissful shore,
To everlasting rest with Thee.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom Heav’n and earth adore,
Be glory as it was of old,
Is now, and shall be evermore.

As now the sun’s declining rays
At eventide descend,
So life’s brief day is sinking down
To its appointed end.
Lord, on the cross Thine arms were stretched,
To draw Thy people nigh;
O grant us then that cross to love,
And in those arms to die.
All glory to the Father be,
All glory to the Son,
All glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,
While endless ages run.

As now Thy children lowly kneel,
And all for mercy pray,
O Father, make us truly feel
The solemn words we say.
Teach us to hate the power of sin,
Which parts our souls from Thee;
Help us to make our life within
What Thou wilt love to see.
Teach us to trust the Lamb of God,
Who takes our sins away;
Help us to choose the path He trod,
And so Thy will obey.
Teach us to keep Thy holy laws
Because we trust Thy love;
Help us to rise, when Jesus draws
To better joys above.
O teach us more our sins to fear
And more Thy Word to love:
Help us on earth the cross to bear
And win the crown above.

As oft, with worn and weary feet,
We tread earth's rugged valley o'er,
The thought, how comforting and sweet:
Christ trod this very path before!
Our wants and weaknesses He knows,
From life's first dawning to its close.
Does sickness, feebleness or pain
Or sorrow in our path appear?
The recollection will remain,
More deeply did He suffer here:
His life, how truly sad and brief,
Filled up with suffering and with grief.
If Satan tempt our hearts to stray
And whisper evil things within,
So did he, in the desert way,
Assail our Lord with thoughts of sin,
When worn and in a feeble hour
The tempter came with all his power.
Just such as I, this earth He trod,
With every human ill but sin;
And though indeed the very God,
As I am now so He has been.
My God, my Savior, look on me,
With pity, love and sympathy.

As on the Cross the Savior Hung
And wept, and bled, and died,
He poured salvation on a wretch
That languished at his side.
His crimes with inward grief and shame
The penitent confessed
Then turned his dying eyes to Christ,
And thus his prayer addressed:
"Jesus, thou Son and heir of heav'n!
Thou spotless Lamb of God!
I see thee bathed in sweat and tears
And welt'ring in thy blood
"Yet quickly from these scenes of woe,
In triumph thou shalt rise--
Burst through the gloomy shades of death,
And shine above the skies.
"Amid the glories of that world,
Dear Saviou, think on me,
and in the vict'ries of thy death
Let me a sharer be."
His prayer the dying Jesus hears,
And instantly replies
"To-day thy parting soul shall be
With me in Paradise."

As pants the hart for cooling streams,
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee
And Thy refreshing grace.
For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine;
O, when shall I behold Thy face,
Thou majesty divine?
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still; and thou shalt sing
The praise of Him Who is thy God,
Thy health’s eternal spring.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom we adore,
Be glory as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.

As powers of good so wonderfully hide us,
we face the future boldly, come what may;
at dawn or dusk our God is still beside us,
to whom we trust, completely, each new day.
Yet still old torments cause consternation;
through days of fear and grief we have despaired.
O, give our tortured souls, Lord, your salvation:
the healing you have promised and prepared.
Then offer us the cup of desolation,
brimfull of bitterness, and we will stand
and drink with thanks, in spite of trepidation,
from such a dearly loved and gracious hand.
Yet should you bring us back to share the gladness
of this bright world, your sunshine breaking through,
we would remember times of pain and sadness
and offer up the whole of life to you.
As evening falls, the candles we have lighted
will point us through the darkness to your light;
we long to be with loved ones, reunited;
we know your love outshines the darkest night.
As silence deepens, let us hear the 
that harmonizes earth's discordant days,
poured out from the unseen that lies before us:
your children's soaring song of endless praise.
By powers of good so faithfully surrounded,
secure and comforted in spite of fear,
we live each day with you Lord, unconfounded,
and go with you to meet the coming year.

As royal banners are unfurled,
the cross displays its mystery:
the Maker of our flesh, in flesh,
impaled and hanging helplessly.
Already deeply wounded: see
his side now riven by a spear,
and all our sins are swept away
by blood and water flowing there.
See everything the prophets wrote
fulfilled in its totality,
and tell the nations of the world
our God is reigning from a tree.
This tree, ablaze with royal light
and with the blood-red robe it wears,
is hallowed and embellished
by the weight of holiness it bears.
Stretched like a balance here, his arms
have gauged the price of wickedness;
but, hanging here, his love outweighs
hell's unforgiving bitterness.
The Savior, victim, sacrifice,
is, through his dying, glorified;
his life is overcome by death
and leaps up, sweeping death aside.
We hail the cross, faith's one true hope:
God's passion set in time and space,
by which our guilt is blotted out,
engulfed in such stupendous grace.

As saints of old their first fruits brought
of orchard, flock, and field
to God the giver all good,
the source of bounteous yield;
so we today first fruits would bring:
the wealth of this good land,
of farm and market, shop and home,
of mind, and heart, and hand.
A world in need now summons us
to labor, love, and give;
to make our life an offering
that others too may live.
The Church of Christ is calling us
to make the dream come true:
a world redeemed, your kingdom come,
all life in Christ made new.
In gratitude and humble trust
we bring our best today,
to serve your cause and share your love
with all humanity.
O God, who gave yourself to us
in Jesus Christ your Son,
teach us to give ourselves each day
until life's work is done.

As shadows cast by cloud and sun
Flit o’er the summer grass,
So, in Thy sight, Almighty One,
Earth’s generations pass.
And as the years, an endless host,
Come swiftly pressing on,
The brightest names that earth can boast
Just glisten and are gone.
Yet doth the star of Bethlehem shed
A luster pure and sweet;
And still it leads, as once it led,
To the Messiah’s feet.
O Father, may that holy star
Grow every year more bright,
And send its glorious beams afar
To fill the world with light.

As the bird flies home to its parent nest,
When the hunter seeks his prey,
O child of God, to thy Father haste,
From the tempter’s snare away.
Under His wings thy defense shall be,
He with His feathers shall cover thee,
Cover thee, cover thee,
He with His feathers will cover thee.
When the winds are cold, and the days are long,
And thy soul from care would hide,
Fly back, fly back, to thy Father then,
And beneath His wings abide.
Oh, the tranquil joy of that dear retreat,
Where the Savior bids thee rest,
With steadfast hope, and a trusting faith,
In His love secure and blest.
’Tis the Lord thy God that to thee has said,
He will guide thee with His eye;
In all thy need, like the weary dove,
To Thy only refuge fly.

As the bridegroom to his chosen,
As the king unto his realm,
As keep unto the castle,
As the pilot to the helm,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.
As the fountain in the garden,
As the candle in the dark,
As the treasure in the coffer,
As the manna in the ark,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.
As the ruby in the setting,
As the honey in the comb,
As the light within the lantern,
As the father in the home,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.
As the sunshine in the heavens,
As the image in the glass,
As the fruits upon the fig tree,
As the dew upon the grass,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.

As the shadows of the night round are falling,
I am thinking of that day by and by;
When the trumpet of the Lord shall be calling,
As the day breaks o'er the hills.
I'll go singing, I'll go shouting on my journey home,
Till the day breaks, till the day breaks;
There'll be singing, there'll be shouting, when we all get home,
When the day breaks o'er the hills.
When we gather home at last there'll be singing,
Such as angels round the throne never heard;
For the song of souls redeemed shall go ringing,
As the day breaks o'er the hills.
I shall rise to be with Jesus forever,
I shall meet the ones who passed on before;
We shall meet to part no more, never, never,
When the day breaks o'er the 

As the dewy shades of even
Gather o'er the balmy air;
Listen, gentle Queen of Heaven,
Listen to our vesper pray'r.
Holy Mother! near me hover
Free my tho'ts from aught defiled;
With thy wings of mercy cover,
Keep from sin thy helpless child.
Thine own sinless heart was broken,
Sorrow's sword had pierced its core;
Holy Mother! by that token,
Now thy pity I implore.
Queen of heaven guard and guide me,
Save my soul from dark despair;
In thy tender bosom hide me,
Take me, Mother, to thy care.

As the sun doth daily rise,
Brightening all the morning skies,
So to Thee with one accord
Lift we up our hearts, O Lord.
Day by day provide us food,
For from Thee come all things good;
Strength unto our souls afford
From Thy living bread, O Lord.
Be our guard in sin and strife;
Be the leader of our life;
Lest from Thee we stray abroad,
Stay our wayward feet, O Lord.
Quickened by the Spirit’s grace
All Thy holy will to trace
While we daily search Thy Word,
Wisdom true impart, O Lord.
Praise we, with the heavenly host,
Father, Son and Holy Ghost;
Thee would we with one accord
Praise and magnify, O Lord.

As the trees in the woods lift their branches to the sky
So the people of the Lord raise their hands
To their good Creator, to the Author of Life
To the Lord, to the Maker, to the Lamb

As the birds in the air lift their voices to the sky
So the people of the Lord raise their song
To their good Creator, to the Author of Life
To the Lord, to the Maker, to the Lamb ( 2x)

As thirst the hart for water brooks,
So thirsts my soul, O God, for Thee;
It seeks for God, and ever looks,
And longs the living God to see,
And longs the living God to see.
Far from the courts of God, my tears
Have been my food by night and day,
While constantly with bitter sneers,
Where is thy God? the scoffers say,
Where is thy God? the scoffers say.
With grief I think of days gone by,
When oft I trod the hallowed way
To Zion, praising God on high
With throngs who kept the holy day,
With throngs who kept the holy day.
O why art thou cast down, my soul,
And why so troubled shouldst thou be?
Hope thou in God, and Him extol,
Who gives His saving help to me,
Who gives His saving help to me.

As Thou, O Lord, hast made me strong
To overcome my mighty foe,
So now to fight against the wrong
And conquer in Thy Name I go.
From strife Thou wilt deliver me,
And make the nations own my sway;
Strange peoples, when my power they see,
Shall come with trembling and obey.
Jehovah lives, and blest is He,
My Rock, my Refuge and Defense,
My Savior Who delivers me,
And will the wicked recompense.
For grace and mercy ever near,
For foes subdued and victories won,
All nations of the earth shall hear
My praise for what the Lord has done.
To David, His anointed King,
And to his sons upon his throne,
The Lord will great salvation bring
And ever make His mercy known.

As water to the thirsty,
as beauty to the eyes,
as strength that follows weakness,
as truth instead of lies,
as songtime and springtime
and summertime to be,
so is my Lord,
my living Lord,
so is my Lord to me.
Like calm in place of clamor,
like peace that follows pain,
like meeting after parting,
like sunshine after rain,
like moonlight and starlight
and sunlight on the sea,
so is my Lord,
my living Lord,
so is my Lord to me.
As sleep that follows fever,
as gold instead of grey,
as freedom after bondage,
as sunrise to the day,
as home to the traveler
and all we long to see,
so is my Lord,
my living Lord,
so is my Lord to me.

As we gather at your table,
as we listen to your word,
help us know, O God, your presence;
let our hearts and minds be stirred.
Nourish us with sacred story
till we claim it as our own;
teach us through this holy banquet
how to make Love's victory known.
Turn our worship into witness
in the sacrament of life;
send us forth to love and serve you,
bringing peace where there is strife.
Give us, Christ, your great compassion
to forgive as you forgave;
may we still behold your image
in the world you died to save.
Gracious Spirit, help us summon
other guests to share that feast
where triumphant Love will welcome
those who had been last and least.
There no more will envy blind us,
nor will pride our peace destroy,
as we join with saints and angels
to

Jesus draw me close
Closer Lord to You
Let the world around me fade away
Jesus draw me close
Closer Lord to You
For I desire to worship and obey
As we seek your face, may we know your heart
Feel your presence, acceptance
As we seek your face
At your feet we fall, sovereign Lord
We cry holy, ho- ly, 
At Your feet we fall
Jesus draw me close
Closer Lord to You
Let the world around me fade away
Jesus draw me close
Closer Lord to You
For I desire to worship and obey

As we sing to you
May your presence fill this room
And as we worship you
May our hearts be turned towards you
To know you, to know you oh my Lord
To seek your holy face
As we worship you, as we worship you
(Hal----le----lu----jah)
May we glorify your name
As we worship you, as we worship you 
(Hal----le----lu----jah)
May our hearts be filled with your praise
(We praise your name)

As we worship You
Let all the world come and see
How the mercy we've received from You
Can set them free
As we worship You
Let all this joy that fills our hearts
Bring a hunger and a hope to those
Who've strayed so far
As we bow in adoration
And stand in reverent awe
Show Your majesty and glory
Let Your anointing fall
As we declare Your name Lord Jesus
As the only name who saves
May the pow'r of Your salvation
Fill each heart we pray
As we worship You
Let all the nations hear our song
The song of Jesus and His blood
That proved His love for all
As we worship You
May all the lost and broken come
May they hear Your still small voice
Call out their names each one
TAG:
As we worship You (x4)

As when the Hebrew prophet raised
The brazen serpent high,
The wounded looked and straight were cured,
The people ceased to die.
So from the Savior on the cross
A healing virtue flows;
Who looks to Him with lively faith
Is saved from endless woes.
For God gave up His Son to death,
So generous was His love,
That all the faithful might enjoy
Eternal life above.
Not to condemn the sons of men
The Son of God appeared;
No weapons in His hand are seen,
Nor voice of terror heard.
He came to raise our fallen state,
And our lost hopes restore;
Faith leads us to the mercy seat,
And bids us fear no more.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s Watts’ original version:
So did the Hebrew prophet raise
The brazen serpent high,
The wounded felt immediate ease,
The camp forbore to die.
“Look upward in the dying hour,
And live," the prophet cries;
But Christ performs a nobler cure,
When Faith lifts up her eyes.
High on the cross the Savior hung,
High in the heav’ns he reigns:
Here sinners by th’ old serpent stung
Look, and forget their pains.
When God’s own Son is lifted up,
A dying world revives;
The Jew beholds the glorious hope,
Th’expiring Gentile lives.

As with gladness, men of old
Did the guiding star behold
As with joy they hailed its light
Leading onward, beaming bright
So, most glorious Lord, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.
As with joyful steps they sped
To that lowly manger bed
There to bend the knee before
Him Whom Heaven and earth adore;
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.
As they offered gifts most rare
At that manger rude and bare;
So may we with holy joy,
Pure and free from sin’s alloy,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.
Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
In the heavenly country bright,
Need they no created light;
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
Thou its Sun which goes not down;
There forever may we sing
Alleluias to our King!

As your family, Lord, see us here,
As your family, Lord, see us here,
As your family, Lord, see us here,
O Lord, see us here.
At your table, Lord, we are fed;
At your table, Lord, we are fed;
At your table, Lord, we are fed;
O Lord, feed us here.
Fill our spirits, Lord, with your love,
Fill our spirits, Lord, with your love,
Fill our spirits, Lord, with your love,
O Lord, give your love.
Make us faithful, Lord, to your will,
Make us faithful, Lord, to your will,
Make us faithful, Lord, to your will,
O Lord, to your will.
As your family, Lord, see us here,
As your family, Lord, see us here,
As your family, Lord, see us here,
O Lord, see us here.

Ascend Thy throne, almighty King,
And spread Thy glories all abroad:
Let Thine own arm salvation bring,
And be Thou known the gracious God.
Let millions bow before Thy seat,
Let humble mourners seek Thy face;
Bring daring rebels to Thy feet,
Subdued by Thy victorious grace.
O let the kingdoms of the world
Become the kingdoms of the Lord;
Let saints and angels praise Thy Name,
Be Thou through Heaven and earth adored.

Ascended Christ, who gained
the glory that we sing,
anointed and ordained
our prophet, priest, and king:
by many tongues
the church displays
your power and praise
in all her songs.
No titles, thrones, or powers
can ever rival yours;
no passing mood of ours
can turn aside your laws:
you reign above
each other name
of worth or fame,
the Lord of love.
Now from the Father's side
you make your people new;
since for our sins you died
our lives belong to you:
from our distress
you set us free
for purity
and holiness.
You call us to belong
within one body here;
in weakness we are strong
and all your gifts we share:
in you alone
we are complete
and at your feet
with joy bow down.
All strength is in your hand,
all power to you is given;
all wisdom to command
in earth and hell and heaven:
beyond all words
creation sings
the King of kings
and Lord of lords.

Verse
Je-sus' work on earth was done;
He had ful-filled God's plan.
Cru-ci-fied, then he a-rose
All for the sake of man.
He taught them for for-ty days 
Things that they all should know, 
Then as-cend-ed back to hea-ven.
He did go.
Up in the sky
To God on high.
"Je-sus will come a-gain" 
Said an-gels nigh!

Ascribe to the Lord, o mighty ones,
Ascribe to the Lord, glory and strength, 
He will give peace unto His people
He will give strength unto the weak
The voice of the Lord is o'er mighty waters
The voice of God thunders, the wilderness shakes
The voice of God melts the hearts of the mighty
His temple will sing, "Glory and Strength"
The voice of the Lord will call down the mountains,
The voice of God shouts, the forests lay bare,
The voice of God breaks the cords of oppression,
His temple will sing, "Glory and Strength"
The Lord of hosts sings the song of deliverance,
O' sword of God rise and ravage the night,
To redeem the lost and bring back the prisoners
Your temple will sing, "Glory and Strength"

See the great promises, brother,
Are they so hard to believe?
How can you doubt the dear Savior?
Why don’t you ask and receive? 
Ask, my brother and sister,
For all you need believe;
Ask the bountiful Giver;
Ask and you shall receive.
Jesus has suffered so meekly,
Sorrowing hearts to relieve;
Trust Him with all of your burdens,
Comfort and strength receive.
If there’s a want in your bosom,
Father will fill it, believe;
Do you need knowledge and wisdom?
Ask and you shall receive.
Open the kingdom of heaven,
Jesus all bounty will give;
Here is the pledge of His promise,
Ask and you shall receive.

Ask and seek and knock real loud

Situations turning 'round
And you know you'll be receivin'
If you're trustin' and believin' 
In the dark of night
In my deep despair

Am I calling in vain?

Overcoming my hurt with this pain 
When you're feeling down
All your plans have failed
Only thorns for a crown
On the cross you're nailed 
You call but nobody seems to hear you
Are you calling in vain?

Overcoming your hurt with His pain

Spoken intro:
Matt: When the world was made life began.It was perfect and whole, but sin 
changed life to death.The Son came forward to return life to its blameless 
state.
Rick: "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life," He said, so He was sent to 
restore the work of His father, and life seemed to overcome.
James: But as He hung from the cross and His life ebbed away, He whispered, "It 
is finished." Death once again reigned.
Brian Fuller: Three days passed as life stood still.Then, life filled the void 
that death had token whole.Life arose victoriously and has been given to us.
Brian Lewis: Life has been restored to perfection through the One from whom it 
was so freely given.
Fading twilight, dusk is near
A star emerges bright and clear
Shining gently from on high
Is this my guardian angel guiding me tonight? 
Lost and hopeless, can't even stand
Then comes a stranger, a helping hand
There by your side in your time of need
Unforseen comfort, a bringer of God's holy peace 
Ask for angels (ask Him, ask Him for angels)
Guiding light (guiding light)
Ask for angels (ask Him, ask Him for angels)
Through the night (through the night)
Ask for angels (ask Him, ask Him for angels)
God provides (God provides)
And when you ask for angels
They are at your side 
Praying mother, sleepless child
Weary traveler, driving through the night
Unaware of darkness near by
For there is an angel keeping them in the light 
When it seems the world is closing in with all its might
When it seems you're all alone and must give up the fight
Just call upon the Lord and He is there to see you through
He'll send ten thousand angels strong, an army just for you 
And when you ask for angels
They are at your side 

“Ask for the showers of blessing,
Ye shall not seek Me in vain";
After the voice of confessing,
“Sound of abundance of rain."
Ask for the rain, ask not in vain;
“I will pour water on him that is thirsty,
And floods upon the dry ground."
“Bring all the ‘tithes’ to My storehouse,
Prove Me herewith," saith the Lord;
Windows of heaven shall open,
Wonderful blessings be poured.
“Mine all the gold and the silver,
Mine all the houses and lands;
Blood-bought are ye and your children,
See the nail-prints in My hands."

Ask ye what great thing I know,
That delights and stirs me so?
What the high reward I win?
Whose the Name I glory in?
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.
What is faith’s foundation strong?
What awakes my heart to song?
He Who bore my sinful load,
Purchased for me peace with God,
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.
Who is He that makes me wise
To discern where duty lies?
Who is He that makes me true
Duty, when discerned to do,
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.
Who defeats my fiercest foes?
Who consoles my saddest woes?
Who revives my fainting heart,
Healing all its hidden smart?
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.
Who is life in life to me?
Who the death of death will be?
Who will place me on His right,
With the countless hosts of light?
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.
This is that great thing I know;
This delights and stirs me so;
Faith in Him Who died to save,
Him Who triumphed over the grave:
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.

Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep,
From which none ever wakes to weep;
A calm and undisturbed repose,
Unbroken by the last of foes.
Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet,
To be for such a slumber meet,
With holy confidence to sing
That death has lost his venomed sting!
Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest,
Whose waking is supremely blessed;
No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour
That manifests the Savior’s power.
Asleep in Jesus! Oh, for me
May such a blessed refuge be!
Securely shall my ashes lie
And wait the summons from on high.
Asleep in Jesus! time nor space
Debars this precious “hiding place";
On Indian plains or Lapland snows
Believers find the same respose.
Asleep in Jesus! Far from thee
Thy kindred and their graves may be;
But there is still a blessed sleep,
From which none ever wakes to weep.

Assembled at Thy great command,
Before Thy face, dread King, we stand;
The voice that marshaled every star
Has called Thy people from afar.
We meet through distant lands to spread
The truth for which the martyrs bled;
Along the line, to either pole,
The anthem of Thy praise to roll.
Our prayers assist; accept our praise;
Our hopes revive; our courage raise;
Our counsels aid; to each impart
The single eye, the faithful heart.
Forth with Thy chosen heralds come;
Recall the wandering spirits home;
From Zion’s mount send forth the sound,
To spread the spacious earth around.

Assist thy servant Lord
The gospel to proclaim;
Let power and love attend the word,
And every breast inflame.
Bid unbelief depart;
With love his soul inflame;
Take full possession of his heart,
And glorify thy name.
May stubborn sinners bend
To thy divine control;
Constrain the wand'ring to attend.
And make the wounded whole.

Tell me not of the pleasures of sin,
For I now from its bondage am free,
And the joys of the One crucified
Have e
Shall I shrink from the thorns in the way,
When He lendeth me favor and breath,
When the thorns He hath borne on His brow,
When He tasted the sorrows of death? 
Though I walk ’mid the sorrows of life,
And the billows of sin sweep the sky,
I will trust in my Savior and Friend,
To His wide open arms I will fly.
Oh, I fear not the breakers of sin,
For my anchor is fastened above,
And the One who has gone on before
Has enraptured my soul with His love.
Though my path be in sadness and grief,
And the shadows grow dark on the lea,
And the last earthly friend prove untrue,
I will trust in the blood shed for me.
When around me the sea billows foam,
Let me hide till the storm passes by,
From the tempter’s allurement and charm,
In the Rock that is higher than I.

In the mountains of joy, in the valley of tears 
I will love you, I will trust you 
When the flame's burning bright, when I'm weary and dry 
I will love you, I will trust you 
You are my strength and you are my song giving me hope and guiding me on 
()
At all times I will sing of your greatness 
At all times I will sing of your love 
At all times I will sing of your faithfulness 
For your goodness remains and your love is the same at all times 
When your guidance is clear, when I can't see ahead 
I will love you, I will trust you 
In the summer of life, in the soul's darkest night 
I will love you, I will trust you 

At all times praise the Lord;
His promises are sure;
What if thou doubt? His steadfast Word
Unchanging shall endure.
Praise Him when skies are bright,
And gladness fills thy days;
Heav’n shames thee with its glorious light,
And calls thee to His praise.
Praise Him when clouds are dark;
True faith waits not to prove;
Tho’ hope no bright’ning gleam may mark,
His meaning still is love.
Praise Him when drear and lone
The shadows ’round thee fall,
No eye upon Thy sins but One—
Fear not, He pardons all.
Praise Him when home is sweet,
As tho’ we ne’er should part;
But pray—while kindred spirits meet—
Pray for a thoughtful heart.
Praise Him when far away
On mountain or on sea;
Each place is home to them who pray;
The Father guardeth thee.
Praise Him when joyful songs
The saints on earth unite,
In sacred , with the throngs
Of angels in the height.
At all times praise the Lord;
His promises are sure;
Fear not, doubt not; His steadfast Word
Unchanging shall endure.

At the Name of Jesus, every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him King of glory now;
’Tis the Father’s pleasure we should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.
Mighty and mysterious in the highest height,
God from everlasting, very light of light:
In the Father’s bosom with the spirit blest,
Love, in love eternal, rest, in perfect rest.
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight,
All the angel faces, all the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations, stars upon their way,
All the heavenly orders, in their great array.
Humbled for a season, to receive a name
From the lips of sinners unto whom He came,
Faithfully He bore it, spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious when from death He passed.
Bore it up triumphant with its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures, to the central height,
To the throne of Godhead, to the Father’s breast;
Filled it with the glory of that perfect rest.
Name Him, brothers, name Him, with love strong as death
But with awe and wonder, and with bated breath!
He is God the Savior, He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshipped, trusted and adored.
In your hearts enthrone Him; there let Him subdue
All that is not holy, all that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain in temptation’s hour;
Let His will enfold you in its light and power.
Brothers, this Lord Jesus shall return again,
With His Father’s glory, with His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.

Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.
By God’s Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.
Now I’ve given to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!
Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!

At Cana's wedding, long ago,
they knew his presence by this sign,
a virtue none but Christ could show,
to turn their water into wine:
And still on us his blessing be
as in the days of Galilee.
What if the way be far to go
and life at times a weary load?
Yet may our hearts within us glow
as theirs on that Emmaus road:
The risen Christen become our guest,
with him to walk, in him to rest.
O Lord of all our life below,
O risen Lord of realms above,
eternal joy be theirs to know,
united in the bond of love:
One in the faith, with one accord,
one with each other and the Lord.

At even, ere the sun was set,
The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;
O, with how many pains they met!
O, with what joy they went away!
Once more ’tis eventide, and we,
Oppressed with various ills, draw near;
What if Thyself we cannot see?
We know that Thou art ever near.
O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;
For some are sick, and some are sad;
And some have never loved Thee well,
And some have lost the love they had.
And some are pressed with worldly care
And some are tried with sinful doubt;
And some such grievous passions tear,
That only Thou canst cast them out.
And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,
For none are wholly free from sin;
And they who fain would serve Thee best
Are conscious most of wrong within.
O Savior Christ, Thou too art man;
Thou has been troubled, tempted, tried;
Thy kind but searching glance can scan
The very wounds that shame would hide.
Thy touch has still its ancient power.
No word from Thee can fruitless fall;
Hear, in this solemn evening hour,
And in Thy mercy heal us all.

At first I prayed for light:
Could I but see the way,
How gladly, swiftly would I walk
To everlasting day!
And next I prayed for strength:
That I might tread the road
With firm, unfaltering feet, and win
The heavens’ serene abode.
And then I prayed for faith:
Could I but trust my God,
I’d live infolded in His peace,
Though foes were all abroad.
But now I pray for love:
Deep love to God and man;
A living love that will not fail,
However dark His plan.
And light and strength and faith
Are opening everywhere!
God waited patiently until
I prayed the larger prayer.

At the Lamb’s high feast we sing,
Praise to our victorious King,
Who hath washed us in the tide
Flowing from his pierced side;
Praise we Him, Whose love divine
Gives His sacred blood for wine,
Gives His body for the feast,
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.
Where the Paschal blood is poured,
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel’s hosts triumphant go
Through the wave that drowns the foe.
Praise we Christ, Whose blood was shed,
Paschal Victim, paschal Bread;
With sincerity and love
Eat we Manna from above.
Mighty Victim from the sky,
Hell’s fierce powers beneath Thee lie;
Thou hast conquered in the fight,
Thou hast brought us life and light;
Now no more can death appall,
Now no more the grave enthrall;
Thou hast opened Paradise,
And in Thee Thy saints shall rise.
Paschal triumph, Easter joy,
Only sin can this destroy;
From sin’s death do Thou set free
Souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.
Hymns of glory and of praise,
Father, to Thee we raise;
Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,
Ever with the Spirit be.

At length there dawns the glorious day
By prophets long foretold,
At length the clearer grows
That shepherds heard of old.
The day of dawning brotherhood
Breaks on our eager eyes,
And human hatreds flee before
The radiant eastern skies.
For what are sund’ring strains of blood,
Or ancient caste and creed?
One claim unites all men in God
To serve each human need.
Then here together, brother men,
We pledge the Lord anew
Our loyal love, our stalwart faith,
Our service strong and true.
One common faith unites us all,
We seek one common goal;
One tender comfort broods upon
The struggling human soul.
To this clear call of brotherhood
Our hearts responsive ring
We join the glorious new crusade
Of our great Lord and King.

Oh, how oft amid our labor
Do we think of what will be
When the boat shall drop its anchor
In the haven o’er the sea!
And our hearts, with joy expanding,
From our trials look away,
When we all shall meet together,
At the breaking of the day!
At the breaking of the day,
When we anchor on the shore,
At the breaking of the day,
When the storms of life are o’er,
When our sorrow and our sighing,
Like a dream will pass away,
When we all shall meet together,
At the breaking of the day!
Oh, how oft amid the conflict
And the battle raging high,
With a faith as clear as noonday
We behold the vict’ry nigh,
And we know that with the righteous
We shall stand in bright array,
When we all shall meet together,
At the breaking of the day!
Endless praise to our Redeemer
For His all atoning love,
That prepares for us a mansion
And a crown of life above,
Where our eyes shall see the beauty
Of the flow’rs that ne’er decay,
When we all shall meet together,
At the breaking of the day!

Alas! and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I?
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, Thine—
And bathed in its own blood—
While the firm mark of wrath divine,
His Soul in anguish stood.
Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!
Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker died,
For man the creature’s sin.
Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears,
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt my eyes to tears.
But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give my self away
’Tis all that I can do.

At the cross her station keeping,
stood the mournful mother weeping, 
close to Jesus at the last,
Through her soul, of joy bereaved,
bowed with anguish, deeply grieved,
now at length the sword hath passed.
O, that blessed one, grief-laden,
blessed Mother, blessed Maiden,
Mother of the all-holy One;
O that silent, ceaseless mourning,
O those dim eyes, never turning
from that wondrous, suffering Son.
Who, on Christ's dear mother gazing,
in her trouble so amazing,
born of woman, would not weep?
Who, on Christ's dear Mother thinking,
such a cup of sorrow drinking,
would not share her sorrows deep?
For his people's sins, in anguish,
there she saw the victim languish,
bleed in torments, bleed and die.
Saw the Lord's anointed taken,
saw her Child in death forrsaken,
heard his last expiring cry.
In the passion of my Maker,
be my sinful soul partaker,
may I bear with her my part;
of his passion bear the token,
in a spirit bowed and broken
bear his death within my heart.
May his wounds both wound and heal me,
he enkindle, cleanse, and heal me,
be his cross my hope and stay.
May he, when the mountains quiver,
from that flame which burns for ever
shield me on the judgment day.
Jesus, may thy cross defend me,
and thy saving death befriend me,
cherished by thy deathless grace:
when to dust my dust returneth,
grant a soul that to thee yearneth
in thy paradise a place.

At the cross of Jesus bowing,
Here I find a safe retreat
From a world of care and trouble,
In His presence calm and sweet.
Sweet stillness of heaven around me I feel,
While low at the cross of my Jesus I kneel.
At the cross of Jesus bowing,
Here I count my blessings o’er;
Here I drink from life’s pure fountain,
Drink until I thirst no more.
At the cross of Jesus bowing,
Here I spend life’s sweetest hour;
Here I taste the joys of heaven,
Fill my heart with conq’ring pow’r.
At the cross of Jesus bowing,
Let me never from it part;
For His dying love has conquered
My rebellious, roving heart.
At the cross of Jesus bowing,
Here I own His way is best;
In the shelter of Mount Calv’ry,
Let me die in peace at last.

Mourner, wheresoever thou art,
At the cross there’s room!
Tell the burden of thy heart,
At the cross there’s room!
Tell it in thy Savior’s ear,
Cast away thine every fear,
Only speak, and He will hear;
At the cross there’s room!
Haste thee, wand’rer, tarry not,
At the cross there’s room!
Seek that consecrated spot;
At the cross there’s room!
Heavy laden, sore oppressed,
Love can soothe thy troubled breast;
In the Savior find thy rest;
At the cross there’s room!
Thoughtless sinner, come today;
At the cross there’s room!
Hark! the Bride and Spirit say,
At the cross there’s room!
Now a living fountain see,
Opened there for you and me,
Rich and poor, for bond and free,
At the cross there’s room!
Blessed thought! For every one
At the cross there’s room!
Love’s atoning work is done;
At the cross there’s room!
Streams of boundless mercy flow,
Free to all who thither go;
Oh, that all the world might know
At the cross there’s room!

There's a river some-where that's called Jordan,
And they say that it's deep and wide,
And they say that the king and beggar,
On that shore they will stand side by side.
()
At the crossing, of the Jordan,
Why should I be afraid? There'll be someone who loves me,
To guide me, 'cross the river,
To endless joys a-bove.
Though the river is dark and it's stormy,
It will pass like a dream in the night.
And my soul will a-wake in the morning,
In regions of endless de-light.
()
my friend Jesus will stand at the river,
And He'll beckon, "just come unto me."
Then the waters of Jordan will be parted,
And on dry ground I'll enter the sea.

At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords,
While they drank from golden vessels, as the Book of Truth records,
In the night, as they reveled in the royal palace hall,
They were seized with consternation—’twas the Hand upon the wall! 
’Tis the hand of God on the wall!
’Tis the hand of God on the wall!
Shall the record be “Found wanting!"
Or shall it be “Found trusting!"
While that hand is writing on the wall?
See the brave captive, Daniel, as he stood before the throne,
And rebuked the haughty monarch for his mighty deeds of wrong;
As he read out the writing—’twas the doom of one and all,
For the kingdom now was finished—said the Hand upon the wall!
See the faith, zeal and courage, that would dare to do the right,
Which the Spirit gave to Daniel—’twas the secret of his might,
In his home in Judea, or a captive in the hall,
He understood the writing of his God upon the wall!
So our deeds are recorded—there’s a Hand that’s writing now:
Sinner, give your heart to Jesus, to His royal mandates bow;
For the day is approaching—it must come to one and all,
When the sinners’ condemnation will be written on the wall!

At the feet of Jesus,
Listening to His word;
Learning wisdom’s lesson
From her loving Lord;
Mary, led by heav’nly grace,
Chose the meek disciple’s place.
At the feet of Jesus
Is the place for me,
There a humble learner
Would I choose to be.
At the feet of Jesus,
Pouring perfume rare,
Mary did her Savior
For the grave prepare;
And, from love the “good work" done,
She her Lord’s approval won.
At the feet of Jesus
Is the place for me,
There, in sweetest service
Would I ever be.
At the feet of Jesus,
In that morning hour,
Loving hearts, receiving
Resurrection power,
Haste with joy to preach the word;
“Christ is risen, praise the Lord!"
At the feet of Jesus,
Risen now for me,
I shall sing His praises
Through eternity.

I met Jesus at the foot of the cross
When I was bound by sin;
Jesus met me, cleansed my heart of its dross,
He gave sweet peace within.
I met Jesus at the foot of the cross,
I met Jesus at the foot of the cross;
All my sins were washed away;
Sin’s dark night turned into day
When I met Jesus at the foot of the cross.
I found pardon at the foot of the cross,
Forgiveness full and free;
Now I love Him only, all else is loss,
His grace availed for me.
I met Jesus when I needed Him most,
Despair possessed my soul;
I was under condemnation and lost,
When Jesus made me whole.

There is water from the Rock; Flowing from His Throne 
There is hope for all who linger there, 
and drink of heaven’s Own 
At the Fountain 
At the Fountain of His Love 
His forgiveness and His grace begin 
At the Fountain of His Love 
Everywhere that sin abides; 
Love aboundeth more 
And for the soul that’s tempest tossed; 
Love waits on the shore 
For every long and dreary night; Love will greet the day 
On the broken road, and weary path; 
Love will show the way 
And every stronghold of the dark; 
Love shall tear it down 
And every saint that will endure; 
He shall wear Love’s crown 

At the Lamb’s high feast we sing,
Praise to our victorious King,
Who hath washed us in the tide
Flowing from his pierced side;
Praise we Him, Whose love divine
Gives His sacred blood for wine,
Gives His body for the feast,
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.
Where the Paschal blood is poured,
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel’s hosts triumphant go
Through the wave that drowns the foe.
Praise we Christ, Whose blood was shed,
Paschal Victim, paschal Bread;
With sincerity and love
Eat we Manna from above.
Mighty Victim from the sky,
Hell’s fierce powers beneath Thee lie;
Thou hast conquered in the fight,
Thou hast brought us life and light;
Now no more can death appall,
Now no more the grave enthrall;
Thou hast opened Paradise,
And in Thee Thy saints shall rise.
Paschal triumph, Easter joy,
Only sin can this destroy;
From sin’s death do Thou set free
Souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.
Hymns of glory and of praise,
Father, to Thee we raise;
Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,
Ever with the Spirit be.

At the Name of Jesus, every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him King of glory now;
’Tis the Father’s pleasure we should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.
Mighty and mysterious in the highest height,
God from everlasting, very light of light:
In the Father’s bosom with the spirit blest,
Love, in love eternal, rest, in perfect rest.
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight,
All the angel faces, all the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations, stars upon their way,
All the heavenly orders, in their great array.
Humbled for a season, to receive a name
From the lips of sinners unto whom He came,
Faithfully He bore it, spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious when from death He passed.
Bore it up triumphant with its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures, to the central height,
To the throne of Godhead, to the Father’s breast;
Filled it with the glory of that perfect rest.
Name Him, brothers, name Him, with love strong as death
But with awe and wonder, and with bated breath!
He is God the Savior, He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshipped, trusted and adored.
In your hearts enthrone Him; there let Him subdue
All that is not holy, all that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain in temptation’s hour;
Let His will enfold you in its light and power.
Brothers, this Lord Jesus shall return again,
With His Father’s glory, with His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.

At Thy feet, O Christ, we lay
Thine own gift of this new day;
Doubt of what it holds in store
Makes us crave Thine aid the more;
Lest it prove a time of loss,
Mark, it Savior, with Thy Cross.
If it flow on calm and bright,
Be Thyself our chief Delight;
If it bring unknown distress,
Good is all that Thou canst bless;
Only, while its hours begin,
Pray we, keep them clear of sin.
We in part our weakness know
And in part discern our foe;
Well for us, before Thine eyes
All our danger open lies;
Turn not from us, while we plead
Thy compassions and our need.
Fain would we Thy Word embrace,
Live each moment on Thy grace,
All our selves to Thee consign,
Fold up all our wills in Thine,
Think, and speak, and do, and be
Simply that which pleases Thee.
Hear us, Lord, and that right soon;
Hear, and grant the choicest boon
That Thy love can e’er impart,
Loyal singleness of heart;
So shall this and all our days,
Christ and God, show forth Thy praise.

At Thy feet, our God and Father,
Who has blest us all our days,
We with grateful hearts would gather,
To begin this hour with praise:
Praise for light so brightly shining
On our steps from Heaven above;
Praise for mercies daily twining
Round us golden cords of love.
Jesus, for Thy love most tender,
On the cross for sinners shown,
We would praise Thee, and surrender
All our hearts to be Thine own:
With so blest a Friend provided,
We upon our way would go,
Sure of being safely guided,
Guarded well from every foe.
Every day will be the brighter
When Thy gracious face we see;
Every burden will be lighter
When we know it comes from Thee,
Spread Thy love’s broad banner o’er us,
Give us strength to serve and wait,
Till the glory breaks before us
Through the City’s open gate.

Author of faith, eternal Word,
Whose Spirit breathes the active flame;
Faith like its finisher and Lord,
Today as yesterday the same.
To Thee our humble hearts aspire,
And ask the gift unspeakable;
Increase in us the kindled fire,
In us the work of faith fulfill.
By faith we know Thee strong to save;
Save us, a present Savior Thou!
Whate’er we hope, by faith we have
Future and past subsisting now.
To him that in Thy Name believes
Eternal life with Thee is given;
Into Himself He all receives,
Pardon and holiness, and Heaven.
The things unknown to feeble sense,
Unseen by reason’s glimmering ray,
With strong commanding evidence
Their heavenly origin display.
Faith lends its realizing light,
The clouds disperse, the shadows fly;
Th’invisible appears in sight,
And God is seen by mortal eye.

Author of life divine,
Who hast a table spread,
Furnished with mystic wine
And everlasting bread,
Preserve the life Thyself hast given,
And feed and train us up for Heav’n.
Our needy souls sustain
With fresh supplies of love,
Till all Thy life we gain,
And all Thy fullness prove,
And, strengthened by Thy perfect grace,
Behold without a veil Thy face.

Ave Maria! blessed Maid!
Lily of Eden's fragrant shade!
Who can express the love
that nurtured thee, so pure and sweet,
making thy heart a shelter meet
for Jesus' holy Dove!
Ave Maria! Mother blest,
to whom, caressing and caressed,
clings the eternal Child;
favored beyond Archangels' dream,
when first on thee with tendered gleam
thy new-born Savior smiled.
Thou wept'st meek Maiden, Mother mild.,
thou wept'st upon thy sinless Child,
thy very heart was riven:
and yet, what mourning matron here
would deem thy sorrows bought too dear
by all on this side heaven!
A Son that never did amiss,
that never shamed his Mother's kiss,
nor crossed her fondest prayer:
e'en from the Tree he deigned to bow
for her his agonized brow,
her, his sole earthly care.
Ave Maria! thou whose name
all but adoring love may claim,
yet may we reach thy shrine;
for he, thy Son and Savior, vows
to crown all lowly lofty brows
with love and joy like thine.

Awake, and sing the song
Of Moses and the Lamb;
Wake, every heart and every tongue,
To praise the Savior’s Name.
Sing of His dying love;
Sing of His rising power;
Sing how He intercedes above
For those whose sins He bore.
Sing on your heavenly way,
Ye ransomed sinners, sing;
Sing on, rejoicing every day
In Christ, the eternal King.
Soon shall we hear Him say,
“Ye blessed children, come!"
Soon will He call us hence away,
To our eternal home.
There shall each raptured tongue
His endless praise proclaim;
And sweeter voices tune the song
Of Moses and the Lamb.

Awake, arise, lift up your voice,
let Easter music swell;
rejoice in Christ, again rejoice
and on his praises dwell.
Oh, with what gladness and surprise
the saints their Savior greet;
nor will they trust their ears and eyes
but by his hands and feet,
those hands of liberal love indeed
in infinite degree,
those feet still free to move and bleed
for millions and and for me.
His enemies had sealed the stone
as Pilate gave them leave,
lest dead and friendless and alone
he should their skill deceive.
O Dead arise! O Friendless stand
by seraphim adored!
O Solitude again command
your host from heaven restored!

Awake! Awake! the Master now is calling us,
Arise! Arise! And, trusting in His Word,
Go forth! Go forth! Proclaim the year of jubilee,
And take the cross, the blessed cross of Christ our Lord.
On, on, swell the ,
On, on, the morning star is shining o’er us;
On, on, while before us,
Our mighty, mighty Savior leads the way.
Glory, glory, hear the everlasting throng,
Shout “Hosanna!" while we boldly march along;
Faithful soldiers here below, only Jesus will we know;
Shouting “Free salvation!" o’er the world we go.
A cry for light from dying ones in heathen lands;
It comes, it comes across the ocean’s foam;
Then haste! Oh, haste to spread the words of truth abroad,
Forgetting not the starving poor at home, dear home.
O Church of God, extend thy kind, maternal arms,
To save the lost on mountains dark and cold;
Reach out thy hand with loving smile to rescue them,
And bring them to the shelter of the Savior’s fold.
Look up! Look up! The promised day is drawing near,
When all shall hail, shall hail the Savior King;
When peace and joy shall fold their wings in every clime,
And “Glory, hallelujah!" o’er the earth shall ring.

Awake! Awake! Fling off the night,
for God has sent a glorious light,
and we who live in Christ's new day
must works of darkness put away.
Awake and sing, with praises strong,
in psalm and hymn and spirit-song.
Let love our words and works renew
with all that's good and right and true.
Let in the light; all sin expose
to Christ, whose life no darkness knows.
Before the cross expectant kneel,
that Christ may judge, and judging, heal.
Then rise as children of the light.
Be neither proud, nor hide from sight.
Be careful how you live, and wise 
to sift the truth from cunning lies.
Through Christ give thanks to God, and say
to other sleepers on the way:
"Awake, and rise up from the dead
that Christ may shine on you instead!"

Awake! awake! O Christian,
the long dark night is past,
the Daystar is arising,
the dawn is near at last;
the lands so long enshrouded
in darkness deep and drear
are longing that the tidings
of God's love they may hear.
A cry comes o'er the mountains
and floats upon the breeze,
from tropic shores and islands,
and from the Arctic seas.
'Neath gleaming constellations,
the pole star in the north,
from Yukon's ice-bound borders,
the yearning cry comes forth.
From sea-girt Australasia,
where in the starry sky
the Southern Cross burns brightly,
again there comes the cry.
In valleys fair and smiling,
where Christian ne'er hath trod,
the weary hearts are sighing
for thee--the unknown God.
Where o'er the slopes of Persia
the fiery crescent gleams,
from distant dark Uganda,
and Niger's deadly streams,
from China's unloved daughters,
from flower-crowned Japan,
the cry is heard, "O tell us,
God's wondrous love to man."
From lips of suffering sisters,
'neath India's glowing sun,
from earth's dark, cruel places,
from many a weary one,
the cry is "Come and help us,
who grope as in the night,
our eyes are blind and sightless,
O show us the true light."
"O hear our cry, good Christian,
and in our sore distress
reveal to us the Savior,
who longs to love and bless;
and then with hearts uplifted,
and grateful voice we'll raise,
to Father, Son, and Spirit,
our joyful song of praise."

Awake, awake, O heart of mine!
Sing praise to God above;
Take up the song of endless years,
And sing redeeming love!
Redeemed by Him Who bore my sins,
When on the cross He died;
Redeemed and purchased with His blood,
Redeemed and sanctified.
Awake, awake, o heart of mine!
Sing praise, sing praise to God above;
Take up the song of endless years,
And sing redeeming love!
Redeemed by Him, my Lord and King,
Who saves me day by day;|
My life and all its ransomed powers
Could ne’er His love repay.
And yet His mercy condescends
My humble gift to own;
And through the riches of His grace,
He brings me near His throne.
O love, unchanging, love sublime!
Not all the hosts above
Can reach the height or sound the depth
Of God’s eternal love.
This wondrous love enfolds the world,
It fills the realms above;
’Tis boundless as eternity;
Oh, praise the God of love!

Awake, awake the sacred song,
To our incarnate Lord;
Let every heart and every tongue
Adore th’Eternal Word.
That awful Word, that sovereign Power,
By whom the worlds were made,
O happy morn, illustrious hour,
Was once in flesh arrayed.
Then shone almighty power and love,
In all their glorious forms,
When Jesus left His throne above,
To dwell with sinful worms.
To dwell with misery below,
The Savior left the skies,
And sunk to wretchedness and woe,
That worthless man might rise.

Awake, awake to love and work!
The lark is in the sky;
The fields are wet with diamond dew;
The worlds awake to cry
Their blessings on the Lord of life,
As He goes meekly by.
Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,
Shout with their shout of praise;
See how the giant sun soars up,
Great lord of years and days!
So let the love of Jesus come
And set thy soul ablaze.
To give and give, and give again,
What God hath given thee;
To spend thyself nor count the cost;
To serve right gloriously
The God Who gave all worlds that are,
And all that are to be.

Awake! for the trumpet is sounding!
Awake to its call, and obey!
The voice of our Leader cries, “Onward!"
Oh, let us no longer delay!
No truce while the foe is unconquered;
No laying the armor down!
No peace till the battle is ended,
And victory wins the crown!
Then gird on the sword of the Spirit,
With helmet, and breastplate, and shield;
And valiantly follow your Captain,
Determined you never will yield!
Then forward! O army of Zion,
With hearts that are loyal and brave!
Stand firm by the Cross and its banner;
And rest in the “Mighty to save"!

Awake, glad soul! awake! awake!
Thy Lord has risen long;
Go to His grave, and with thee take
Both tuneful heart and song.
Where life is waking all around,
Where love’s sweet voices sing,
The first bright blossom may be found
Of an eternal spring.
The shade and gloom of life are fled
This resurrection day;
Henceforth in Christ are no more dead,
The grave hath no more prey.
In Christ we live, in Christ we sleep,
In Christ we wake and rise,
And the sad tears death makes us weep,
He wipes from all our eyes.
And every bird and every tree,
And every opening flower,
Proclaim His glorious victory,
His resurrection power.
The folds are glad, the fields rejoice,
With vernal verdure spread,
The little hills lift up their voice
And shout that death is dead.
Then wake, glad heart! awake! awake
And seek Thy risen Lord;
Joy in His resurrection take,
And comfort in His Word.
And let thy life, through all its ways,
One long thanksgiving be:
Its theme of joy, its song of praise—
Christ died, and rose for me.

Awake, Jerusalem, awake!
No longer in thy sins lie down;
The garment of salvation take,
Thy beauty and thy strength put on.
Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight,
And hides the promise from thine eyes;
Arise, and struggle into light,
The great Deliverer calls: Arise!
Shake off the bands of sad despair;
Zion, assert thy liberty;
Look up, thy broken heart prepare,
And God shall set the captive free.
Vessels of mercy, sons of grace,
Be purge from every sinful stain,
Be like your Lord, His Word embrace,
Nor bear His hallowed Name in vain.

Awake, my heart, with gladness,
See what today is done;
Now, after gloom and sadness,
Comes forth the glorious Sun.
My Savior there was laid
Where our bed must be made
When to the realms of light
Our spirit wings its flight.
The foe in triumph shouted
When Christ lay in the tomb;
But, lo, he now is routed,
His boast is turned to gloom.
For Christ again is free;
In glorious victory
He Who is strong to save
Has triumphed o’er the grave.
This is a sight that gladdens;
What peace it doth impart!
Now nothing ever saddens
The joy within my heart.
No gloom shall ever shake,
No foe shall ever take,
The hope which God’s own Son
In love for me hath won.
Now hell, its prince, the devil
Of all their powers are shorn;
Now I am safe from evil,
And sin I laugh to scorn.
Grim Death with all his might
Cannot my soul affright;
He is a powerless form,
Howe’er he rave and storm.
The world against me rageth
Its fury I disdain;
Though bitter war it wageth
Its work is all in vain.
My heart from care is free,
No trouble troubles me.
Misfortune now is play
And night is bright as day.
Now I will cling forever
To Christ, my Savior true;
My Lord will leave me never,
Whate’er He passeth through.
He rends Death’s iron chain,
He breaks through sin and pain,
He shatters hell’s dark thrall,
I follow Him through all.
To halls of heavenly splendor
With Him I penetrate;
And trouble ne’er may hinder
Nor make me hesitate.
Let tempests rage at will,
My Savior shields me still;
He grants abiding peace
And bids all tumult cease.
He brings me to the portal
That leads to bliss untold,
Whereon this rhyme immortal
Is found in script of gold:
“Who there My cross hath shared
Finds here a crown prepared;
Who there with Me hath died
Shall here be glorified."

Awake, my soul, and with the sun
Thy daily stage of duty run;
Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise,
To pay thy morning sacrifice.
Thy precious time misspent, redeem,
Each present day thy last esteem,
Improve thy talent with due care;
For the great day thyself prepare.
By influence of the Light divine
Let thy own light to others shine.
Reflect all Heaven’s propitious ways
In ardent love, and cheerful praise.
In conversation be sincere;
Keep conscience as the noontide clear;
Think how all seeing God thy ways
And all thy secret thoughts surveys.
Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart,
And with the angels bear thy part,
Who all night long unwearied sing
High praise to the eternal King.
All praise to Thee, Who safe has kept
And hast refreshed me while I slept
Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake
I may of endless light partake.
Heav’n is, dear Lord, where’er Thou art,
O never then from me depart;
For to my soul ’tis hell to be
But for one moment void of Thee.
Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;
Disperse my sins as morning dew.
Guard my first springs of thought and will,
And with Thyself my spirit fill.
Direct, control, suggest, this day,
All I design, or do, or say,
That all my powers, with all their might,
In Thy sole glory may unite.
I would not wake nor rise again
And Heaven itself I would disdain,
Wert Thou not there to be enjoyed,
And I in hymns to be employed.
Heaven is, dear Lord, where’er Thou art;
O never then from me depart;
For to my soul ’tis hell to be
But for one moment without Thee.
Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue,
My glory wake and sing,
And celebrate the holy birth,
The birth of Israel’s King!
O happy night that brought forth light,
Which makes the blind to see,
The Dayspring from on high came down
To cheer and visit thee.
The careful shepherds with their flocks
Were watching for the morn,
But better news from Heav’n was brought;
Your Savior now is born!
In Bethlehem the Infant lies,
Within a place obscure,
Your Savior’s come, O sing God’s praise!
O sing His praise fore’er.

Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve,
And press with vigor on;
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
And an immortal crown,
And an immortal crown.
A cloud of witnesses around
Hold thee in full survey;
Forget the steps already trod,
And onward urge thy way,
And onward urge thy way.
’Tis God’s all animating voice
That calls thee from on high;
’Tis His own hand presents the prize
To thine aspiring eye.
Then wake, my soul, stretch every nerve,
And press with vigor on,
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
And an immortal crown.

Awake, my soul, to joyful lays,
And sing thy great Redeemer’s praise;
He justly claims a song from me -
His lovingkindness, O how free!
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,
His lovingkindness, O how free!
He saw me ruined in the fall,
Yet loved me notwithstanding all;
He saved me from my lost estate -
His lovingkindness, O how great!
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,
His lovingkindness, O how great!
Though numerous hosts of mighty foes,
Though earth and hell my way oppose,
He safely leads my soul along -
His lovingkindness, O how strong!
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,
His lovingkindness, O how strong!
When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gathered thick and thundered loud,
He near my soul has always stood -
His lovingkindness, O how good!
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,
His lovingkindness, O how good!
Often I feel my sinful heart
Prone from my Jesus to depart;
But though I have him oft forgot,
His lovingkindness changes not.
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,
His lovingkindness changes not.
Soon I shall pass the gloomy vale,
Soon all my mortal powers must fail;
O! may my last expiring breath
His lovingkindness sing in death.
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,
His lovingkindness sing in death.
Then let me mount and soar away
To the bright world of endless day;
And sing with raptures and surprise,
His lovingkindness in the skies.
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,
His lovingkindness in the skies.

Awake, my soul! to sound His praise,
Awake my harp to sing;
Join, all my pow’rs the song to raise,
And morning incense bring.
Among the people of his care,
And thro’ the nations round,
Glad sons of praise will I prepare,
And there his name resound.
Be Thou exalted, O my God!
Above the starry train;
Diffuse Thy heav’nly grace abroad,
And teach the world Thy reign.
So shall Thy chosen sons rejoice,
And throng Thy courts above;
While sinners hear Thy pard’ning voice,
And taste redeeming love.

Awake, my tongue, thy tribute bring
To Him Who gave Thee power to sing;
Praise Him Who is all praise above,
The source of wisdom and of love.
How vast is His knowledge, how profound!
A deep where all our thoughts are drowned;
The stars He numbers, and their names
He gives to all those heavenly flames.
Through each bright world above, behold
Ten thousand thousand charms unfold;
Earth, air, and mighty seas combine
To speak His wisdom all divine.
But in redemption, O what grace!
Its wonders, O what thought can trace!
Here, wisdom shines forever bright;
Praise Him, my soul, with sweet delight.

Awake, O Christian, from thy sleep,
And heed thy brother’s call!
He cries to thee across the deep,
Where darkest shadows falls.
From sin and guilt and wretchedness
He knows not where to flee;
Go tell him how the Lord can bless!
Thy brother calls to thee.
’Mid deepest gloom and darkest night
He lifts his helpless hands;
Can aught but Jesus give him light
Or break his cruel bands?
Then send, O send the Master’s Word
Across the wide blue sea,
Where Macedonia’s cry is heard!
Thy brother calls to thee.
O save the lost, the sinner turn!
To blind men send the light!
O let thy soul with ardor burn
To lead them to the right;
Then usher in that glorious day,
The kingdom yet to be,
When all shall own the Master’s sway!
Thy brother calls to thee.

Awake, O Lord, as in the time of old!
Come, Holy Spirit, in Thy power and might;
For lack of Thee our hearts are strangely cold,
Our minds but blindly groping towards the light.
Doubts are abroad: make Thou these doubts to cease!
Fears are within: set Thou these fears at rest!
Strife is among us: melt that strife to peace!
Change marches onward: may all change blest!
Make us to be what we profess to be;
Let prayer be prayer, and praise be heartfelt praise;
From unreality, O set us free,
And let our words be echoed by our ways.
Turn us, good Lord, and so shall we be turned:
Let every passion grieving Thee be stilled:
Then shall our race be won, our guerdon earned,
Our Master looked on, and our joy fulfilled.

Awake, O Zion’s daughter,
Awake from sorrow’s night;
Come forth in all thy beauty,
Arrayed in garments bright;
Why should thy vales be silent?
Why should thy harps be still,
When He, the Lord, is coming,
Thy soul with joy to fill?
Awake, awake, O Zion’s daughter,
Awake from sorrow’s night;
Come forth in all thy beauty,
Arrayed in garments bright.
Thou hast not been forsaken,
Tho’ long by foes oppressed;
Thy tears were not unheeded,
By Him who loves thee best;
Oh, look above the shadows
For Him who yet shall reign;
Look up with eyes expectant,
Thy trust is not in vain.
His arm thy foes shall conquer,
His power their strength shall bind,
And they shall fly in terror,
Like chaff before the wind,
While thou thyself triumphant,
Upon the earth shall stand,
The light of every nation,
The pride of every land.

Awake, our souls! away, our fears!
Let every trembling thought be gone!
Awake, and run the heavenly race,
And put a cheerful courage on.
True, ’tis a strait and thorny road,
And mortal spirits tire and faint;
But they forget the mighty God,
That feeds the strength of every saint.
O mighty God, Thy matchless power
Is ever new, and ever young;
And firm endures, while endless years
Their everlasting circles run.
From Thee, the ever flowing spring,
Our souls shall drink a fresh supply;
While such as trust their native strength
Shall melt away, and droop, and die.
Swift as the eagle cuts the air,
We’ll mount aloft to Thine abode;
On wings of love our souls shall fly,
Nor tire along the heavenly road.

Awake, thou careless world, awake!
That final judgment day will surely come;
What Heav’n hath fixed no time can shake,
Time never more shall sweep away thy doom.
Know what the Lord Himself hath spoken
Shall come at last and not delay:
Though Heav’n and earth shall pass away,
His steadfast Word can ne’er be broken.
Awake! thou careless world, awake!
For none can tell how soon our God may please
That suddenly that day should break,
No human wisdom fathoms depths like these:
O flee earth’s base delights and pride,
For as the bird is in the snare,
Or ever of its foe aware,
So comes that day so long denied.
Yet He in love delayeth long
That awful day, and grants the sinner space
To turn away from sin and wrong,
And mourning seek in time His love and grace.
He holdeth back that best of days
Until the righteous shall approve
Their faith and hope, their constant love;
So gentle us-ward are His ways!
And those found faithful then shall see
That glorious morning dawn in love and joy,
Their Savior comes to set them free,
Their Judge Himself shall all their bonds destroy;
He the true Joshua then shall bring
His people with a mighty hand
Into their promised fatherland,
Where songs of victory they shall sing.
Arise, and let us night and day
Watch for our Lord, and study o’er His Word,
And in the Spirit ever pray,
That we be ready when His call is heard;
Arise, and let us haste to meet
The Bridegroom standing at the door,
That with the angels evermore
We too may worship at His feet.

Awake, Thou Spirit, Who didst fire
The watchmen of the Church’s youth,
Who faced the foe’s envenomed ire,
Who witnessed day and night Thy truth,
Whose voices loud are ringing still
And bringing hosts to know Thy will.
Lord, let our earnest prayers be heard,
The prayer Thy Son hath bid us pray;
For lo, Thy children’s hearts are stirred
In every land in this our day
To cry with fervent soul to Thee,
Oh, help us, Lord! So let it be!
Oh, haste to help ere we are lost!
Send preachers forth, in spirit strong,
Armed with Thy Word, a dauntless host,
Bold to attack the rule of wrong;
Let them the earth for Thee reclaim,
Thy heritage, to know Thy Name.
And let Thy Word have speedy course,
Through every land be glorified,
Till all the heathen know its force
And fill Thy churches far and wide.
Oh, spread the conquest of Thy Word
And let Thy kingdom come, dear Lord!

Awaked by Sinai’s awful sound,
My soul in bonds of guilt I found,
And knew not where to go;
Eternal truth did loud proclaim,
“The sinner must be born again,
Or sink to endless woe."
Amazed I stood, but could not tell
Which way to shun the gates of hell,
For death and hell drew near;
I strove, indeed, but strove in vain;
“The sinner must be born again"
Still sounded in my ear.
When to the law I trembling fled,
It poured its curses on my head;
I no relief could find.
This fearful truth increased my pain;
“The sinner must be born again"
O’erwhelmed my tortured mind.
The saints I heard with rapture tell
How Jesus conquered death and hell,
And broke the fowler’s snare;
Yet when I found this truth remain,
“The sinner must be born again,"
I sank in deep despair.
But while I thus in anguish lay,
The gracious Savior passed this way,
And felt His pity move;
The sinner, by His justice slain,
Now by His grace is born again;
And sings redeeming love.

Awaked from sleep we fall
before thee, God of love,
and chant the praise the angels raise,
O God of might, above:
Holy, holy, holy! Thou art God adored!
In thy pitying mercy show us mercy, Lord.
As at thy call I rise,
shine on this mind and heart,
and touch my tongue, that I among
thy choir may take my part:
Holy, holy, holy! Thou art God adored!
In thy pitying mercy show us mercy, Lord.
The Judge will come with speed,
and each man's deeds be known,
our trembling cry shall rise on high
at midnight to thy throne:
Holy, holy, holy! King of Saints adored!
In the hour of judgment show us mercy, Lord.

I wake at dawn 
To a solitary song; 
Yet I know not where 
It comes from- 
I walk as if in dream, 
To the source of the stream; 
And I wash in the waters, 
Clear my mind from illusion- 
So I look within, 
To my spirit, to my hymn; 
For that is where 
I can find your blessing- 
And I smile, but I cry 
Cause' it's been too long; 
Since I've thanked for 
Giving this me this song- 

Awaken the song in me
Rouse my heart to love
Refreshing your song in me
Draw me now to love
Renew passion, restore vision
Awaken the song in me
To sing to you, to dance with you
It is good to be near you my God
To sing to you, to dance with you
It is good to be near you my God
I will sing to you
(repeat)

Away! away! not a moment to linger,
Haste we now with footstep free,
Where those who love in the vineyard to labor,
Wait for you and me.
To the Sunday school rejoicing we will go,
’Tis a place where all are happy here below.
Where the way of life we learn to know,
And seek our home above.
Away! away! where the angels are bending
Lightly o’er the house of prayer.
Glad hymns of praise to the Lord of the Sabbath,
Sweetly echo there.
Away! away! for the moments are flying,
Time for us will soon be o’er;
This holy day we will try to improve it,
Ere its light is o’er.
Away! away! not a moment to linger,
Haste we now with footsteps free,
Where those who love in the vineyard to labor,
Wait for you and me.

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,
And fit us for Heaven to live with Thee there.

Away upon the mountain top,
The breezes blow mild,
Where, Mary, sweet mother dear,
Is rock-ing her child.
She cradles Him so tenderly,
In arms snowy white,
Enfolds Him in her loving care
And sings through the night:
|: Diri diri, halelujah,
 Halelujah, halelujah! :|
The Baby wakes from slumber deep,
And looks to the sky.
Great peace shall come to all the earth
Thru God's gift from on high.
The angels sing this holy night,
"All praise to the King,
The Prince of Peace, the Son of God,
His birth we do sing."
|: Diri diri, halelujah,

Away with our fears!
The glad morning appears
When an heir of salvation was born!
From Jehovah I came,
For his glory I am,
And to him I with singing return.
I sing of thy grace,
From my earliest days
Ever near to allure and defend;
Hitherto thou hast been
My preserver from sin,
And I trust thou wilt save to the end.
O the infinite cares,
And temptations, and snares
Thy hand has conducted me through!
O the blessings bestowed
By a bountiful God,
And the mercies eternally new!
What a mercy is this,
What a heaven of bliss,
How unspeakably happy am I;
Gathered into the fold,
With thy people enrolled,
With thy people to live and to die.
All honour and praise
To the Father of grace,
To the Spirit, and Son, I return;
The business pursue
He has made me to do,
And rejoice that I ever was born.
In a rapture of joy
My life I employ
The God of my life to proclaim;
'Tis worth living for, this,
To administer bliss
And salvation in Jesus's name.
My remnant of days
I spend in his praise,
Who died the whole world to redeem:
Be they many or few,
My days are his due,
And they all are devoted to him.

Away with our fears,
Our troubles and tears:
The Spirit is come,
The witness of Jesus returned to his home.
The pledge of our Lord
To his heaven restored
Is sent from the sky,
And tells us our Head is exalted on high.
Our Advocate there
By his blood and his prayer
The gift has obtained,
For us he has prayed, and the Comforter gained.
Our glorified Head
His Spirit has shed,
With his people to stay,
And never again will he take him away.
Our heavenly guide
With us shall abide,
His comforts impart,
And set up his kingdom of love in the heart.
The heart that believes
His kingdom receives,
His power and his peace,
His life, and his joy's everlasting increase.

Away with our sorrow and fear!
We soon shall recover our home,
The city of saints shall appear,
The day of eternity come:
From earth we shall quickly remove,
And mount to our native abode,
The house of our Father above,
The palace of angels and God.
Our mourning is all at an end,
When, raised by the life-giving Word,
We see the new city descend,
Adorned as a bride for her Lord;
The city so holy and clean,
No sorrow can breathe in the air;
No gloom of affliction or sin,
No shadow of evil is there.
By faith we already behold
That lovely Jerusalem here;
Her walls are of jasper and gold,
As crystal her buildings are clear;
Immovably founded in grace,
She stands as she ever hath stood,
And brightly her Builder displays,
And flames with the glory of God.
No need of the sun in that day,
Which never is followed by night,
Where Jesus’ beauties display
A pure and a permanent light:
The Lamb is their light and their sun,
And lo! by reflection they shine,
With Jesus ineffably one,
And bright in effulgence divine!
The saints in His presence receive
Their great and eternal reward;
In Jesus, in Heaven they live,
They reign in the smile of their Lord:
The flame of angelical love
Is kindled at Jesus’ face;
And all the enjoyment above
Consists in the rapturous gaze.

Awesome is the sight of your holiness
Majestic is your purity
Your righteousness shines
Brighter than the sun
On me, on me.
Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord of hosts
Glory, glory, glory
to Your matchless name
Worthy, worthy, worthy
is the lamb that was slain, that was slain.
(repeat)
that was slain.

As I come into Your presence,
Past the gates of praise,
Into Your sanctuary
'Till we're standing face to face.
I look upon Your countenance,
And the fullness of Your grace,
I can only bow down and say;
You are awesome in this place, Mighty God;
You are awesome in this place, Abba Father!
You are worthy of all praise;
To you my life I raise,
You are awesome in this place, Mighty God.

Awesome power, boundless grace
None can fathom all Your ways
Truth and love are found in Your heart alone
Righteousness, around Your throne 
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord Most High
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord Most High 
Awesome power, boundless grace
None can fathom all Your ways
Truth and love are found in Your heart alone
Righteousness, around Your throne 
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord Most High
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord Most High 
Awesome power! 

Awhile in spirit, Lord, to Thee
Into the desert we would flee;
Awhile upon the barren steep
Our fast with Thee in spirit keep.
Awhile from Thy temptation learn
The daily snares of sin to spurn,
And in our hearts to feel and own
Man liveth not by bread alone.
O Thou once tempted like as we,
Thou knowest our infirmity;
Be Thou our Helper in the strife,
Be Thou our true, our inward Life.
And while, at Thy command we pray,
“Give us our bread from day to day,"
May we with Thee, O Christ, be fed,
Thou Word of God, Thou living Bread.

The advent of our God
Our prayers must now employ,
And we must meet Him on His road
With hymns of holy joy.
The everlasting Son
Incarnate deigns to be;
Himself a servant’s form puts on
To set His people free.
Daughter of Zion, rise
To meet thy lowly King,
Nor let thy faithless heart despise
The peace He comes to bring.
As Judge, on clouds of light,
He soon will come again,
And all His scattered saints unite
With Him in Heaven to reign.
Before the dawning day
Let sin’s dark deeds be gone;
The old man all be put away,
The new man all put on.
All glory to the Son
Who comes to set us free,
With Father, Spirit, ever One,
Through all eternity.

The ancient law departs,
And all its terrors cease;
For Jesus makes with faithful hearts
A covenant of peace.
The Light of Light divine,
True brightness undefiled,
He bears for us the shame of sin,
A holy, spotless Child.
His infant body now
Begins our pains to feel;
Those precious drops of blood that flow
For death the victim seal.
Today the Name is Thine,
At which we bend the knee;
They call Thee Jesus, Child divine!
Our Jesus deign to be.

The angel Gabriel from Heaven came,
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame;
“All hail," said he, “thou lowly maiden Mary,
Most highly favored lady," Gloria!
“For know a blessed mother thou shalt be,
All generations laud and honor thee,
Thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold,
Most highly favored lady," Gloria!
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head,
“To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,
“My soul shall laud and magnify His holy Name."
Most highly favored lady, Gloria!
Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born
In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn,
And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say—
“Most highly favored lady," Gloria!

Rolling downward, through the midnight,
Comes a glorious burst of heav’nly song;
’Tis a full of sweetness—
And the singers are an angel throng.
“Glory! glory in the highest!
On the earth goodwill and peace to men!"
Down the ages send the echo;
Let the glad earth shout again!
Wond’ring shepherds see the glory,
Hear the word the shining ones declare;
At the manger fall in worship,
While the music fills the quiv’ring air.
Christ the Savior, God’s Anointed,
Comes to earth our fearful debt to pay—
Man of sorrows, and rejected,
Lamb of God, that takes our sin away.

Ask what thou wilt, believing heart,
The answering time will come;
Pray and believe—that is thy part,
The answering time will come.
The answering time will come;
The answering time will come.
Tho’ dark the way, still trust and pray,
The answering time will come.
Ask in the name of Christ thy Lord,
The answering time will come;
Rest on the promise of His Word,
The answering time will come.
God’s Word is sure; it cannot fail,
The answering time will come;
The prayer of faith shall yet prevail,
The answering time will come.
God will not mock believing prayer,
The answering time will come;
He knows the burden thou dost bear,
The answering time will come.

The morning breaks, ’tis bright and clear,
The shadows of the night are flying swift away;
A stirring cry salutes the ear:
Jesus is coming soon.
The song of jubilee,
It sweeps o’er land and sea;
With thousand voices strong
The speeds along—
One word of hope and cheer:
The kingdom now is near,
Jesus is coming soon,
Jesus is coming soon!
By form and creed are millions bound,
But God hath sent the Word to loose the iron band—
Deliv’rance dawns with this glad sound:
Jesus is coming soon.
Salvation nears—the saints arise,
And from the sleep of death the slumb’ring nations wake;
We too shall mount the starry skies.
Jesus is coming soon.
Our glorious King is coming soon—
It may be darkest night, it may be morn or noon;
In glory then His saints will reign.
Jesus is coming soon.
Awake, ye nations, from the dead,
With everlasting joy let praise your tongues employ;
By this sweet hope be comforted;
Jesus is coming soon.
All praise and glory to His Name!
The King of kings is He, earth’s Sov’reign yet to be;
Let all the saints aloud proclaim,
Jesus is coming soon.

A day, a day of glory!
A day that ends our woe!
A day that tells of triumph
Against our vanquished foe!
Yield, summer’s brightest sunrise,
To this December morn:
Lift up your gates, ye princes,
And let the Child be born!
With Gloria in excelsis
Archangels tell their mirth:
With Kyrie elëyson
Men answer upon earth:
And angels swell the triumph,
And mortals raise the horn,
Lift up your gates, ye princes,
And let the Child be born.
He comes, His throne the manger;
He comes, His shrine the stall;
The ox and ass His courtiers,
Who made and governs all:
The “House of Bread" His birth-place,
The Prince of wine and corn:
Lift up your gates, ye princes,
And let the Child be born.
Then bar the gates, that henceforth
None thus may passage win,
Because the Prince of Israel
Alone hath enered in:
The earth, the sky, the ocean
His glorious way adorn:
Lift up your gates, ye princes,
And let the Child be born.

A debtor to mercy alone, of covenant mercy I sing;
Nor fear, with Thy righteousness on, my person and off’ring to bring.
The terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do;
My Savior’s obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view.
The work which His goodness began, the arm of His strength will complete;
His promise is Yea and Amen, and never was forfeited yet.
Things future, nor things that are now, nor all things below or above,
Can make Him His purpose forgo, or sever my soul from His love.
My name from the palms of His hands eternity will not erase;
Impressed on His heart it remains, in marks of indelible grace.
Yes, I to the end shall endure, as sure as the earnest is giv’n;
More happy, but not more secure, the glorified spirits in Heav’n.

Daily, daily, sing the praises
Of the city God hath made;
In the beauteous fields of Eden
Its foundation stones are laid.
O that I had wings of angels,
Here to spread and heavenward fly!
I would seek the gates of Zion,
Far beyond the starry sky.
All the walls of that dear city
Are of bright and burnished gold;
It is matchless in its beauty,
And its treasures are untold.
In the midst of that dear city
Christ is reigning on His seat,
And the angels swing their censers
In a ring about His feet.
From the throne a river issues,
Clear as crystal, passing bright,
And it traverses the city
Like a sudden beam of light.
There the forests ever blossom,
Like our orchards here in May;
There the gardens never wither,
But eternally are gay.
There the meadows green and dewy
Shine with lilies wondrous fair;
Thousand, thousand, are the colors
Of the waving flowers there.
There the forests ever blossom,
Like our orchards here in May;
There the gardens never wither,
But eternally are gay.
There the wind is sweetly fragrant,
And is laden with the song
Of the seraphs, and the elders,
And the great redeemed throng.
O I would my ears were open
Here to catch that happy strain!
O I would my eyes some vision
Of that Eden would attain!

On the road to Damascus I was hung on the ropes of success
When You stripped away the mask of life
They had placed upon the face of death
And I wanna thank You Lord
More than all of my words can say (I give my life)
I give my life to sing Your praise
And all those fortunes I hoarded
They were the well from which my poverty sprang
Oh they led me to no greater glory and they left me with no less shame
I say I wanna give You glory Lord and I do
But everything that I could ever find to offer comes from You
But if my darkness can praise Your light, You give me breath
And I'll give my life to sing Your praise
On the road to Damascus
I was hung on the ropes of success
When You stripped away the mask of life
They had placed upon the face of death
And I wanna thank You Lord
More than all of my words can say (I give my life)
I give my life to sing Your praise (and beyond this I would not beg)
For anything except of grace (to give my life to sing Your praise)
And beyond this I would not beg (for anything except of grace)
To give my life to sing Your praise (and beyond this I would not beg)
For anything except of grace (to give my life to sing Your praise)
And beyond this I would not beg (for anything except of grace)
To give my life, I give my life
I give my life to sing Your praise

Dance with me oh Lover of my soul, to the song of all songs

Oh, the Holy Ghost will set your feet a-dancing
The Holy Ghost will thrill you through and through
The Holy Ghost will set your feet a-dancing
And set your heart a-dancing too
David danced before the Lord
He danced with all his might
His heart was filled with Holy joy
His spirit was so light
Michal through the window looked
To criticise did start
She didn’t know that David
Had got a dancing heart
David danced before the Lord
To magnify His name
In God’s almighty presence
He felt no sense of shame
The oil of gladness flowed that day
It quickened every part
He hadn’t only dancing feet
He had a dancing heart
Out of Egypt long ago
The Israelites were fed
By a mighty miracle
They all were kept and fed
Through the Red Sea they were brought
The waters stood apart
And God have sister Miriam
A dance down in her heart
There was a celebration
Upon the Red Sea shore
Timbrels rand, desert sands
Became a dancing floor
The people sang and praised God there
And put a dance of love and joy
A-deep down in their hearts
The prodigal was far away
Wandering out in sin
But he came back to father’s house
And father took him in
He put a robe upon his son
The merriment did start
The prodigal got dancing shoes
To match his dancing heart
The father’s house with music rang
To welcome home the son
Wine was flowing full and free
All misery was gone
The elder brother looking on
Complained it wasn’t fair
He hadn’t got a dancing heart
Like all the other’s there
Now many saints are cold and bound
By unbelief today
They want the blessings of the Lord
But worry what men say
O, let the Lord have full control
From dead traditions part
And He will set you free within
You’ll have a dancing heart
Now in the Bible we can read
That in the latter days
Men would leave their first love
And turn to carnal ways
But trueborn saints of Jesus
For the Bridegroom set apart
Are waiting for His coming
With a joyful, dancing heart

There's path with darkness there's a path with light
Old Satan's dark powers are hungry for confusion
King Angels of mercy are waiting there to greet you
And they meet at the old crossroads
Unsatisfied ever greedy for more
Standing on the shores of ever lasting light
The Angels are calling if your spirit will hearken
If you look to your heart at the spirit there a blooming
They're saying come and join us across the shining water
All is forgiven; lay down your weary load
If it's bright and shining sin can harm you no more
Our lanterns of love will guide us though the night
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing with the Angels
Just like old Daniel in the Lion's den
The door will be open and the feast spread out before you
Dancing with the Angels .while the Lion's roar.

I heard about a man one day who wasted not his time away.
He prayed to God every morning noon and night.
He cared not for the things of Baals.He trusted one who never fails.
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night.
Oh, Daniel served the living God while here upon this earth he trod.
He prayed to God every morning noon and night.
He cared not for the king's decree.He trusted God who set him free.
And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night.
They cast him in the lion's den because he would not honor men, 
He prayed to God every morning noon and night.
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God sent all them safely out.
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night.
Now brother, let us watch and pray like Daniel did from day to day.
He prayed to God every morning noon and night.
We too can gladly daring do.The things of God he'll take us through.
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night.

Standing by a purpose true,
Heeding God’s command,
Honor them, the faithful few!
All hail to Daniel’s band! 
Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to stand alone!
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known.
Many mighty men are lost
Daring not to stand,
Who for God had been a host
By joining Daniel’s band.
Many giants, great and tall,
Stalking through the land,
Headlong to the earth would fall,
If met by Daniel’s band.
Hold the Gospel banner high!
On to vict’ry grand!
Satan and his hosts defy,
And shout for Daniel’s band.

Take your stand with the Son of God,
O be faithful to His name;
Plant your feet on the Word of God,
It shall ever be the same.
Dare to stand alone for Christ,
Claim the blood He sacrificed;
Lift the name of Jesus high,
Press onward to the sky.
We are marching toward our goal,
All the world before us lies;
With our Captain we shall endure,
Till we gain the heav'nly prize.
Join us, Christian, and take your stand,
Daily feast upon His Word;
Face the foe with your sword in hand,
Till the vict'ry shout is heard.

Dark and Thorny Is the Desert
Thro' which pilgrims make their way;
But beyond this vale of sorrow
Lie the realms of endless day
Dear young soldiers, do not murmur
At the troubles of the way 
Meet the tempest fight with courage
Never faint, but watch and pray.
Jesus, Jesus, will defend you;
Trust in Him and Him alone
He has shed His blood to save you,
And will bring you to His throne.
There, on flow'ry fields of pleasure,
And the hills of endless rest,
Joy, and peace, and love shall ever
Reign and triumph in your breast.
But methinks a sweeter concert
Makes the crystal arches ring,
And a song is heard in Zion
Which the angles can not sing.
Who can paint these sons of glory,
Ransomed souls that dwell on high,
Who with golden harps forever
Sound redemption through the sky?
There, upon the golden pavement,
See the ransomed march along!
While the splendid courts of glory
Sweetly echo with their song.
Hail! You happy, happy spirits!
Welcome to the blissful plain!
Glory, honor, and salvation!
Reign, sweet Jesus! Ever reign!

Dark is the night, and cold the wind is blowing,
Nearer and nearer comes the breakers’ roar;
Where shall I go, or whither fly for refuge?
Hide me, my Father, till the storm is o’er.
With His loving hand to guide, let the clouds above me roll,
And the billows in their fury dash around me.
I can brave the wildest storm, with His glory in my soul,
I can sing amidst the tempest—Praise the Lord!
Dark is the night, but cheering is the promise,
He will go with me o’er the troubled wave;
Safe He will lead me through the pathless waters,
Jesus, the mighty One, and strong to save.
Dark is the night, but lo! the day is breaking,
Onward my bark, unfurl thy every sail,
Now at the helm I see my Father standing,
Soon will my anchor drop within the veil.

What good can come of this?
My desperation runs so deep
Oh I can not even speak
I find myself doubting You (doubting You)
I’m blinded by my pain
Fear grips my heart with no relief (no relief), and all I know is grief
I did not ask for this, so I cry out to God
Are You really there, or do You even care?
Have You turned Your back on me?
In my darkest hour, You revealed Your power and heard my desperate cry
You shone Your love around, Now blessings they abound
When I was weak You showed Your awesome power
In my darkest hour, You revealed Your power
Is there no other way?
(Father) Father I know this cross is Mine
It is not My will but Thine
I feel so all alone, so I stretch out My hands
This I know, this is the price that must be paid
Oh the life that must be laid
Will they believe in Me?
So I cry out to You, I know You’re still there
And I know You care
Soon they will be free
Though He died upon that tree, He lives like You and me
Death could not keep Him in the ground
Through the tears and through the pain, God brings new life
Like the sun shines through the rain, the rain
For in my darkest hour, You revealed Your power and heard my desperate cry (my 
cry)
And reached to dry my eye
In our darkest hour, You revealed Your power
And heard our desperate cry, and reached to dry our eye
You shone your love around, now blessings they abound
When I was weak (when we were weak) You showed Your awesome power
In my darkest hour
When I’m weak You show Your awesome power
In my darkest hour, You revealed Your power

Darkly rose the guilty morning,
When, the King of glory scorning,
Raged the fierce Jerusalem;
See the Christ, His cross upbearing,
See Him stricken, spit on, wearing
The thorn-plated diadem.
Not the crowd whose cries assailed Him,
Nor the hands that rudely nailed Him,
Slew Him on the cursed tree;
Ours the sin from Heav’n that called Him,
Ours the sin whose burden galled Him
In the sad Gethsemane.
For our sins, of glory emptied,
He was fasting, lone, and tempted,
He was slain on Calvary;
Yet He for His murderers pleaded;
Lord, by us that prayer is needed,
We have pierced, yet trust in Thee.
In our wealth and tribulation,
By Thy precious cross and passion,
By Thy blood and agony,
By Thy glorious resurrection,
By Thy Holy Ghost’s protection,
Make us Thine eternally.

Daughter of Zion, from the dust
Exalt thy fallen head;
Again in thy Redeemer trust;
He calls thee from the dead.
Awake, awake, put on thy strength,
Thy beautiful array;
The day of freedom dawns at length
The Lord’s appointed day.
Rebuild thy walls, thy bounds enlarge,
And send thy heralds forth;
Say to the South, “Give up thy charge!"
And “Keep not back, O North!"
They come, they come; thine exiled bands,
Where’er they rest or roam,
Have heard thy voice in distant lands,
And hasten to their home.
Thus, though the universe shall burn,
And God His works destroy,
With songs thy ransomed shall return,
And everlasting joy.

David rejoiced in God his strength,
Raised to the throne by special grace;
But Christ the Son appears at length,
Fulfills the triumph and the praise.
How great is the Messiah’s joy
In the salvation of Thy hand!
Lord, Thou hast raised His kingdom high,
And giv’n the world to His command.
Thy goodness grants whate’er He will,
Nor doth the least request withhold;
Blessings of love prevent Him still,
And crowns of glory, not of gold.
Honor and majesty divine
Around His sacred temples shine;
Blessed with the favor of Thy face,
And length of everlasting days.
Thine hand shall find out all His foes;
And as a fiery oven glows
With raging heat and living coals,
So shall Thy wrath devour their souls.

Day after day I sought the Lord,
And waited patiently;
Until He bent down from His throne,
And hearkened to my cry.
He drew me from the fearful pit,
And from the miry clay;
He placed my feet upon a rock,
And led me in His way.
He taught my soul a new-made song,
A song of holy praise,
All they who see these things, with fear
Their hopes to God shall raise.
Most blessed is the man whose hope
Upon the Lord relies;
Who follows not the proud, nor those
That turn aside to lies.
O Lord, what wonders hast Thou wrought,
All number far above!
Thy thoughts to us-ward overflow
With mercy, grace, and love.
Show forth Thy mercy, gracious Lord;
O take it not away!
Thy loving kindness and Thy truth,
Let them be still my stay.
For countless sorrows hem me round;
And my iniquities
So hold me fast, and drag me down,
I cannot raise my eyes.
My hairs in number they surpass;
Hence is my heart dismayed;
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to rescue me!
O hasten to my aid.
Let those who seek Thee faithfully
In peace and joy abide;
Let those who love Thy grace still say,
“The Lord be magnified."
Poor am I, and in need; yet God
Care of my soul doth take.
Thou art my help; my Savior Thou;
Lord, no long tarrying make.

Day by day, and with each passing moment,
Strength I find, to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,
I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.
He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure
Gives unto each day what He deems best—
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;
The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,"
This the pledge to me He made.
Help me then in every tribulation
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
Ever to take, as from a father’s hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.

Day by day the manna fell;
O to learn this lesson well!
Still by constant mercy fed,
Give me Lord, my daily bread.
“Day by day," the promise reads,
Daily strength for daily needs;
Cast foreboding fears away;
Take the manna of today.
Lord! my times are in Thy hand;
All my sanguine hopes have planned,
To Thy wisdom I resign,
And would make Thy purpose mine.
Thou my daily task shalt give;
Day by day to Thee I live;
So shall added years fulfill,
Not my own, my Father’s will.
Fond ambition, whisper not;
Happy is my humble lot.
Anxious, busy cares away;
I’m provided for today.
Oh, to live exempt from care
By the energy of prayer:
Strong in faith, with mind subdued,
Yet elate with gratitude!

Tell me why you're crying, my son
I know you're frightened, like everyone
Is it the thunder in the distance you fear?
Will it help if I stay very near?
I am here.
And if you take my hand, my son
All will be well when the day is done
And if you take my hand my son
All will be well when the day is done
Day is done, day is done, day is done
Day is done.
You ask me why I'm sighing, my son
You shall inhereit what mankind has done
In a world filled with sorrow and woe
If you ask me why this is so - 
I really don't know
Tell me why you're smiling, my son,
Is there a secret you can tell everyone?
Do you know more than those who are as wise?
Can you see what we all must disguise?
Through your loving eyes.

Day is dying in the west;
Heav’n is touching earth with rest;
Wait and worship while the night
Sets the evening lamps alight
Through all the sky.
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
Heav’n and earth are full of Thee!
Heav’n and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord most high!
Lord of life, beneath the dome
Of the universe, Thy home,
Gather us who seek Thy face
To the fold of Thy embrace,
For Thou art nigh.
While the deepening shadows fall,
Heart of love enfolding all,
Through the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face,
Our hearts ascend.
When forever from our sight
Pass the stars, the day, the night,
Lord of angels, on our eyes
Let eternal morning rise
And shadows end.

Day of God, thou blessed day,
At thy dawn the grave gave way
To the power of Him within,
Who had, sinless, bled for sin.
Thine the radiance to illume
First, for man, the dismal tomb,
When its bars their weakness owned,
There revealing death dethroned.
Then the Sun of righteousness
Rose, a darkened world to bless,
Bringing up from mortal night
Immortality and light.
Day of glory, day of power,
Sacred be thine every hour:
Emblem, earnest, of the rest
That remaineth for the blest.

Day of judgment! Day of wonders!
Hark! the trumpet’s awful sound,
Louder than a thousand thunders,
Shakes the vast creation round!
How the summons wilt the sinner’s heart confound! 
See the Judge, our nature wearing,
Clothed in majesty divine!
You who long for His appearing
Then shall say, “This God is mine!"
Gracious Savior, own me in that day for Thine!
At His call the dead awaken,
Rise to life from earth and sea;
All the powers of nature shaken
By His look, prepares to flee.
Careless sinner, what will then become of thee!
Horrors, past imagination,
Will surprise your trembling heart,
When you hear your condemnation,
“Hence, accursed wretch, depart!
Thou, with Satan and his angels, have thy part!"
Satan, who now tries to please you,
Lest you timely warning take,
When that word is past, will seize you,
Plunge you in the burning lake:
Think, poor sinner, thy eternal all’s at stake.
But to those who have confessed,
Loved and served the Lord below,
He will say, “Come near, ye blessed,
See the kingdom I bestow;
You forever shall My love and glory know."
Under sorrows and reproaches,
May this thought your courage raise!
Swiftly God’s great day approaches,
Sighs shall then be changed to praise.
We shall triumph when the world is in a blaze.

The day of redemption hath come with a song—
The song of redemption from sin so strong.
The angels first chanted it over a hill;
As Christmas returneth it echoes still.
Hail! Hail! day of redemption!
Hark the angel rings!
Hail! Hail! day of redemption!
Bow before the King of kings!
Redemption most wonderful! Gift from the sky,
Redeemer most gentle, so low to lie!
O herald so glorious sent from above,
To speak to the shepherds of God’s great love.
O marvel of tenderness! Marvel of light!
The King from the glory, so wondrous bright!
Is resting all quietly, pillowed on hay,
And gone is earth’s darkness! Behold! ’tis day!

Day of wrath, O day of mourning!
See fulfilled the prophet’s warning,
Heaven and earth in ashes burning.
Oh, what fear man’s bosom rendeth
When from Heav’n the Judge descendeth
On Whose sentence all dependeth!
Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,
Through earth’s sepulchers it ringeth,
All before the throne it bringeth.
Death is struck and nature quaking;
All creation is awaking,
To its Judge an answer making.
Lo, the book, exactly worded,
Wherein all hath been recorded;
Thence shall judgment be awarded.
When the Judge His seat attaineth
And each hidden deed arraigneth,
Nothing unavenged remaineth.
What shall I, frail man, be pleading?
Who for me be interceding
When the just are mercy needing?
King of majesty tremendous,
Who dost free salvation send us,
Fount of pity, then befriend us.
Think, good Jesus, my salvation
Caused Thy wondrous incarnation;
Leave me not to reprobation!
Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,
On the cross of suffering bought me;
Shall such grace be vainly brought me?
Righteous Judge, for sin’s pollution
Grant Thy gift of absolution
Ere that day of retribution!
Guilty, now I pour my moaning,
All my shame with anguish owning:
Spare, O God, Thy suppliant groaning!
From that sinful woman shriven,
From the dying thief forgiven,
Thou to me a hope hast given.
Worthless are my prayers and sighing;
Yet, good Lord, in grace complying,
Rescue me from fires undying.
With Thy favored sheep, oh, place me!
Nor among the goats abase me,
But to Thy right hand upraise me.
While the wicked are confounded,
Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,
Call me, with Thy saints surrounded.
Low I kneel with heart submission,
See, like ashes, my contrition;
Help me in my last condition!
Day of sorrow, day of weeping,
When, in dust no longer sleeping,
Man awakes in Thy dread keeping!
This additional verse may be used with tunes of a different meter:
To the rest Thou didst prepare me
On Thy cross; O Christ, upbear me!
Spare, O God, in mercy spare me!

Daystar on high, bright harbinger of gladness,
piercing the clouds of ignorance and error,
thou hast dispersed our night of sin and sadness;
death has no terror.
Darkness is past, joy cometh in the morning;
hope springs anew for sinners without number:
Sleepers, awake! a brighter day is dawning;
shake off your slumber.
Alleluia!
Prophets of old spake darkly of this wonder,
psalmist and saints have handed on the story;
now he is risen, bursting bonds asunder,
risen to glory.
Earth's tyrants quail; the mighty make obeisance:
he hath preferred the innocent and lowly:
mercy and truth shine round about his presence:
his name is holy.
Alleluia!
Victor he comes in majesty, revealing
promise of life and liberty to mortals;
heaven and earth, with hymns of triumph pealing,
throw wide their portals.
Praise him, ye nations, hearts and voices blending:
raise high your song; the Conqueror advances:
praise him with cymbals, lute and harp attending,
praise him with dances.
Alleluia!
Hail him the Monarch, Ruler of creation;
prince and powers, bow your heads before him,
this is the Lord, the God of our salvation;
let us adore him.
Lord God of hosts, great Deity supernal,
be thou our strength, by thee our steps be guided,
Father and Son and Spirit co-eternal,
One undivided.
Alleluia!

Days and moments quickly flying
Blend the living with the dead;
Soon our bodies will be lying
Each within its narrow bed.
Soon our souls to God Who gave them
Will have sped their rapid flight:
Able now by grace to save them,
O that, while we can, we might!
Jesus, infinite Redeemer,
Maker of this mighty frame,
Teach, O teach us to remember
What we are, and whence we came.
Whence we came and whither wending,
Soon we must through darkness go,
To inherit bliss unending,
Or eternity of woe.
Jesus, merciful Redeemer,
Rouse dead souls to hear Thy voice;
Wake, O wake each idle dreamer
Now to make the eternal choice.
Soon before the Judge all glorious
We with all the dead shall stand:
Savior, over death victorious,
Place us then on Thy right hand.

Lead: None
These are the days of Elijah
Declaring the Word of the Lord
And these are the days of your servant, Moses
Righteousness being restored
And though these are days of great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword
Still we are the voice in the desert crying
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord"
Behold, He comes
Riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun
At the trumpet call
Lift your voice
It's the year of Jubilee
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes
These are the days of Ezekiel
The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of your servant, David
Rebuilding a temple of praise
And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are as white in the world
And we are the laborers in your vineyard
Declaring the Word of the Lord
Lift your voice
It's the year of Jubilee
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes

Dayspring of eternity!
Hide no more Thy radiant dawning!
Light from light’s exhaustless sea,
Shine on us afresh this morning!
And dispel with glorious might
All our night.
Let Thy mercies’ morning dew
Rouse our conscience from its blindness:
Gladden life’s dry plains anew
With the rivers of Thy kindness;
Water daily us Thy flock
From the rock.
Let the glow of love destroy
Cold obedience faintly given,
Wake our hearts to love and joy
With the flushing eastern heaven;
Let us truly rise ere yet
Life hath set.
Through this dark and tearful place
Never be Thy light denied us.
O Thou glorious Sun of grace,
To yon world of gladness guide us,
When to joys that never end
We ascend!
Ah! Thou Dayspring from on high
Grant that at Thy next appearing
We who in the graves do lie
May arise, Thy summons hearing,
And rejoice in our new life,
Far from strife.
Light us to those heavenly spheres,
Sun of grace, in glory shrouded;
Lead us through this vale of tears
To the land whose days unclouded,
Purest joy, and perfect peace
Never cease.

Dear Brother, Mama left us this morning
Death's angels took her a- way
She's gone to meet Daddy up there in heaven
But we'll meet again some day.[C7]
She left this world with a smile on her face
Whisp'ring the Saviour's name
Dear Brother, Mama left us this morning
For the city where is no pain.
As I stood by her bedside, those last few moments
I lived my childhood again
I thought of you Brother and of the old homestead
And my tears they fell like rain.

Dear Christian people all, rejoice,
Each soul with joy upraising.
Pour forth a song with heart and voice,
With love and gladness singing.
Give thanks to God, our Lord above,
Thanks for His miracle of love!
Dearly He hath redeemed us.
He spoke to His beloved Son
With infinite compassion:
“Go hence, my heart’s most precious One,
Be to the lost Salvation;
Death, his relentless tyrant, stay,
And bear him from his sins away
With Thee to live forever!"
The Son came, saying: “Cling to Me,
Thy sorrows now are ending;
Freely I give Myself to thee,
Thy life with Mine defending;
For I am thine and thou art Mine,
And where I am there thou shalt shine,
The foe shall never reach us."
“To heaven again I rise from hence,
High to my Father soaring,
The Master there to be, and thence
My Spirit on thee pouring;
In every grief to comfort thee,
And teach thee more and more of Me,
Into all truth still guiding."
“What I have done and taught on earth,
Do Thou, and teach, none dreading;
That so God’s kingdom may go forth,
And His high praise be spreading;
And guard thee from the words of men,
Lest the great joy be lost again:
This my last charge I leave thee."

Dear Christians, one and all, rejoice,
With exultation springing,
And, with united heart and voice
And holy rapture singing,
Proclaim the wonders God hath done,
How His right arm the victory won;
Right dearly it hath cost Him.
Fast bound in Satan's chains I lay,
Death brooded darkly o'er me,
Sin was my torment night and day,
In sin my mother bore me;
Yea, deep and deeper still I fell,
Life had become a living hell,
So firmly sin possessed me.
My own good works availed me naught,
No merit they attaining;
Free will against God's judgment fought,
Dead to all good remaining.
My fears increased till sheer despair
Left naught but death to be my share;
The pangs of hell I suffered.
But God beheld my wretched state
Before the world's foundation,
And, mindful of His mercies great,
He planned my soul's salvation.
A father's heart He turned to me,
Sought my redemption fervently:
He gave His dearest Treasure.
He spoke to His beloved Son:
'Tis time to have compassion.
Then go, bright Jewel of My crown,
And bring to man salvation;
From sin and sorrow set him free,
Slay bitter death for him that he
May live with Thee forever.
This Son obeyed His Father's will,
Was born of virgin mother,
And God's good pleasure to fulfill,
He came to be my Brother.
No garb of pomp or power He wore,
A servant's form, like mine, He bore,
To lead the devil captive.
7.To me He spake: Hold fast to Me,
I am thy Rock and Castle;
Thy Ransom I Myself will be,
For thee I strive and wrestle;
For I am with thee, I am thine,
And evermore thou shalt be Mine;
The Foe shall not divide us.
The Foe shall shed My precious blood,
Me of My life bereaving.
All this I suffer for thy good;
Be steadfast and believing.
Life shall from death the victory win,
My innocence shall bear thy sin;
So art thou blest forever.
Now to My Father I depart,
The Holy Spirit sending
And, heavenly wisdom to impart,
My help to thee extending.
He shall in trouble comfort thee,
Teach thee to know and follow Me,
And in all truth shall guide thee.
1What I have done and taught, teach thou,
My ways forsake thou never;
So shall My kingdom flourish now
And God be praised forever.
Take heed lest men with base alloy
The heavenly treasure should destroy;
This counsel I bequeath thee.

Dear Father, Whom we cannot see,
We know that Thou art near;
With longing hearts we turn to Thee,
And ask that Thou wilt set us free
From war and hate and fear.
Dear Father, King of love and peace,
We know that Thou art strong;
Make conflicts everywhere to cease,
Let mercy everywhere increase,
And kindness conquer wrong.
Dear Father, Lord of sea and land,
We know that Thou art wise;
O make the nations understand
That only by Thy guiding hand
Can lasting peace arise.

Dear God, our Father, at Thy knees confessing
Our sins and follies, close in Thine embrace,
Children forgiven, happy in Thy blessing,
Deepen our spirits to receive Thy grace.
Not for more beauty would our eyes entreat Thee,
Flooded with beauty, beauty everywhere;
Only for keener vision that may greet Thee,
In all Thy vestures of the earth and air.
The stars and rainbows are Thy wondrous wearing,
Sunlight and shadow moving on the hills;
Holy the meadow where Thy feet are faring,
Holy the brooklet that Thy laughter fills.
Not for more love our craving hearts implore Thee,
But for more power to love until they glow
Like hearths of comfort, eager to restore Thee,
Hidden in human wretchedness and woe.
In souls most sullen Thou art softly dreaming
Of saints and heroes wrought from Thy divine
Pity and patience, still the lost redeeming,
Deepen our spirits for love like Thine.

Dear Is the Spot Where Christians Sleep
And sweet the strains their spirits pour;
O, why should we in anguish weep?
They are not lost, but gone before.
Secure from every mortal care,
By sin and sorrow vexed no more,
Eternal happiness they share,
Who are not lost, but gone before.
To Zion's peaceful courts above,
In faith triumphant may we soar,
Embracing in the arms of love
The friends not lost, but gone before.
To Jordan's bank, whene'er we come,
And hear the swelling waters roar,
Jesus, convey us safely home, 
To friends not lost, but gone before.

Dear Jesus, canst Thou help me?
My soul is full of woe;
My heart is almost breaking,
I’ve nowhere else to go.
I’ve nowhere else to go,
Dear Jesus, but to Thee,
And so I lift my voice and cry,
Have mercy, Lord on me.
Have mercy, Lord, on me.
Have mercy, Lord on me
And so I lift my voice and cry,
Have mercy, Lord on me.
I feel I am a sinner,
And this my only plea,
The sweet and blessed assurance,
That Thou hast died for me.
I’ve heard there is a fountain,
Where cleansing waters flow;
My sins though red like crimson,
May now be white as snow.
Thy blood doth fill that fountain,
Thy blood so pure and free;
That blood availed for others,
And now avails for me.
Dear Jesus, loving Savior;
Thou precious dying Lamb,
Where here my faith is pleading;
Now take me as I am.

Dear little One! how sweet Thou art,
Thine eyes so bright they shine,
So bright they almost seem to speak
When Mary's looks meet thing.
How faint and feeble is thy cry,
Like plaint of harmless dove,
When Thou dost murmur in thy sleep
Of sorrow and of love.
When Mary bids Thee sleep Thou sleep'st,
Thou wakest when she calls;
Thou art content upon her lap,
Or in the rugged stalls.
Simplest of Babes! with what a grace,
Thou dost Thy mother's will,
Thine infant fashions all betray
The God-head's hidden skill.
When Joseph takes Thee in his arms,
And smooths Thy little cheek,
Thou lookest up into his face
So helpless and so meek.
Yes! Thou art what Thou seem'st to be,
A thing of smiles and tears;
Yet Thou art God, and heav'n and earth,
Adore Thee with their fears.

Low in a manger, dear little Stranger,
Jesus, the wonderful Savior, was born.
There was none to receive Him, none to believe Him,
None but the angels were watching that morn.
Dear little Stranger, slept in a manger,
No downy pillow under His head;
But with the poor He slumbered secure,
The dear little Babe in His bed.
Angels descending, over Him bending,
Chanted a tender and silent ;
Then a wonderful story told of His glory,
Unto the shepherds on Bethlehem’s plain.
Dear little Stranger, born in a manger,
Maker and Monarch, and Savior of all;
I will love You forever! Grieve You? No, never!
You did for me make Your bed in a stall.

Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
Forgive our foolish ways;
Reclothe us in our rightful mind,
In purer lives Thy service find,
In deeper reverence, praise.
In simple trust like theirs who heard,
Beside the Syrian sea,
The gracious calling of the Lord,
Let us, like them, without a word,
Rise up and follow Thee.
O Sabbath rest by Galilee,
O calm of hills above,
Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee
The silence of eternity,
Interpreted by love!
With that deep hush subduing all
Our words and works that drown
The tender whisper of Thy call,
As noiseless let Thy blessing fall
As fell Thy manna down.
Drop Thy still dews of quietness,
Till all our strivings cease;
Take from our souls the strain and stress,
And let our ordered lives confess
The beauty of Thy peace.
Breathe through the heats of our desire
Thy coolness and Thy balm;
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
O still, small voice of calm.

Dear Lord and Master mine,
Thy happy servant see;
My Conqueror, with what joy divine
Thy captive clings to Thee!
I love Thy yoke to wear,
To feel Thy gracious bands;
Sweetly restrained by Thy care
And happy in Thy hands.
No bar would I remove,
No bond would I unbind;
Within the limits of Thy love
Full liberty I find.
I would not walk alone,
But still with Thee, my God;
At every step my blindness own,
And ask of Thee the road.
Dear Lord and Master mine,
Still keep Thy servant true;
My Guardian and my Guide divine
Bring, bring Thy pilgrim through.
My Conqueror and my King,
Still keep me in Thy train;
And with Thee Thy glad captive bring
When Thou return’st to reign.

Dear Lord, we long to see your face,
to know you risen from the grave,
but we have missed the joy and grace
of seeing you, as others have;
yet in your company we'll wait,
and we shall see you, soon or late.
Dear Friend, we do not know the way,
nor clearly see the path ahead;
so often, therefore, we delay
and doubt your power to raise the dead;
yet we with you will firmly stay--
you are the truth, the life, the way.
We find it hard, Lord, to believe.
Long habit makes us want to prove:
to see, to touch, and thus perceive
the truth and person whom we love;
yet when in fellowship we meet,
you come yourself, each one to greet.
You come to us, our God, our Lord.
You do not show your hands and side,
but give, instead, your best reward
as in your promise we abide.
By faith we know and grow and wait
to see and praise you, soon or late.

Dear Lord, who dwellest with us now
In sad humanity,
Give us beneath the cross to bow
Which men have laid on Thee.
When hunger calls to us for bread
With childhood’s piteous plea,
Make us to know what Thou hast said
Of those who give to Thee.
When stranger knocketh at our door
For cheer and sympathy,
Our hearts would warmest greetings pour,
That we may welcome Thee.
When sick and sore distressed appeal
In man’s infirmity,
We’d haste the broken heart to heal
That we may comfort Thee.
When captive lives in mortal pains
Are clamoring to be free,
We’d strike away the heavy chains
That we may succor Thee.

Dear Lord, on this Thy servant’s day,
Who left for Thee the gold and mart,
Who heard Thee whisper, “Come away,"
And followed with a single heart,
Give us, amid earth’s weary moil,
And wealth for which men cark and care,
’Mid fortune’s pride, and need’s wild toil,
And broken hearts in purple rare,
Give us Thy grace to rise above
The glare of this world’s smelting fires;
Let God’s great love put out the love
Of gold, and gain, and low desires.
Still, like a breath from scented lime
Borne into rooms where sick men faint,
His voice comes floating through all time,
Thine own evangelist and saint.
Still sweetly rings the Gospel strain
Of golden store that knows not rust:
The love of Christ is more than gain,
And heavenly crowns than yellow dust.

Dear Master, in Thy way
Our willing feet shall tread;
What joy Thy mandate to obey,
Our great and glorious Head.
The closing waters hid
Our former world, and we,
Seeking through death our Savior’s side,
Rejoice to die with Thee.
And as we rise again,
Be this confession giv’n,
That we have ris’n with Christ to reign
The Lord of earth and Heav’n.
So would we die to live,
And live no more to die;
Our risen lives, O Christ, receive
And seal them in the sky.

Dear Redeemer, Keep Me Free
Precious Jesus, Jesus, free in thee,
From all evil every hour,
By thy Spirit's, Spirit's healing power.
Savior, hear, draw me near,
Keep me in thy tender care,
Safe from every chilling blast,
Then I'll rest in, rest in thee at last.
O, the comfort and the joy,
Of thy presence, presence, nor alloy!
Then to thee how sweet to sing!
Dearly blessed, blessed Lord and King.
Yea, with contrite heart each day
Sing thy praise in, praise in richest lay;
And when life on earth is done,
May I dwell with, dwell with thee at home,
There to join th'angelic throng,
And the blood-washed, blood-washed saints in song,
And in richest diadem,
Singing, "Glory, glory, and Amen;
"Glory to the great I AM,
Highest honor, honor to the Lamb;
Halleluia and amen,
Praises, glory, glory, yea, amen."

Hark, hark the song, gliding along,
Borne on the summer breeze, far, far away;
Dear Sabbath home, once more we come,
Hailing with glad delight this happy day;
Eyes beaming brightly, hearts bounding lightly,
Now we sing our merry, merry lay.
Dear Sabbath home, once more we come,
Hailing with glad delight this happy day.
Green shady bowers, sweet blushing flowers,
Come with the summer time, blooming anew;
Morn’s gentle ray, golden and gay,
Shines on the lily-bells sparkling with dew;
Beauty is calling, music is falling,
Now again earth wakes her joyful lay.
Hark, hark the song, floating along,
Borne to the sunny land fadeless and fair;
Savior and King, gladly we bring
Praise for Thy precious love, Thy tender care;
Gathered before Thee, young hearts adore Thee,
Savior, hear, O hear our happy lay.

Dear Savior, from Thy throne above,
Where countless children bow,
Oh, let Thy loving eye behold
And bless us children now.
Our hearts in tuneful numbers wake,
Our tongues with rapture sing,
All glory, honor, praise to Thee,
Redeemer, Lord and King!
Thy mercy led us thro’ the year
That sweetly passed away,
And thro’ Thy grace we gather now
To hail our festive day.
Oh, may we learn in early youth
Thy holy Word to prize,
The lamp that guides our feet to Heav’n,
Our home beyond the skies.
Oh, happy thought, if, faithful here,
We work and watch and pray,
We’ll spend with Thee in Heav’n at last
An endless happy day.

Dear Savior, if these lambs should stray,
From Thy secure enclosure’s bound,
And, lured by worldly joys away,
Among the thoughtless crowd be found,
Remember still that they are Thine,
That Thy dear sacred Name they bear,
Think that the seal of love divine
The sign of covenant grace they wear.
In all their erring, sinful years,
Oh, let them ne’er forgotten be;
Remember all the prayers and tears
Which made them consecrate to Thee.
And when these lips no more can pray,
These eyes can weep for them no more,
Turn Thou their feet from folly’s way,
The wanderers to Thy fold restore.

Dear Savior, stretch Thy loving arms
Above the stormy sea,
Where, tossed ’mid dark and angry waves,
The mariner calls to Thee.
Upon that fierce and angry main
My poor weak bark doth ride,
O what am I ’mid such strong foes
Without Thee by my side?
O as Thou didst on Galilee
The waters calm at will,
When torrents raised by evil breath
The sinking ship did fill:
So now in my storm shaken soul
Awake with strength divine,
And whisper ‘peace’ to warring winds,
And let Thy glory shine.
Be Thou my Pilot through the mists
And storms that darkly rise,
As o’er life’s vast and dangerous sea
My frail bark lightly flies.
With Thee my soul securely rests
From evil’s blight restored;
And isles of green and fragrant seas
Bring peace and sweet reward.

Dear Saviour, Thou art mine,
How sweet the thought to me!
Let me And lift my heart to Thee.
Mine! mine! mine!
I know Thou art mine;
Saviour, dear Saviour,
I know Thou art mine.
Thou art the sinner's Friend,
So I Thy friendship claim,
A sinner saved by grace
When Thy sweet message came.
My hardened heart was touched;
Thy pard'ning voice I heard;
And joy and peace came in
While list'ning to Thy Word.
So let me sing Thy praise,
So let me call Thee mine;
I cannot doubt Thy Word,
I know that I am Thine.

Dear Shepherd of Thy people, hear;
Thy presence now display;
As Thou hast given a place for prayer,
So give us hearts to pray.
O Lord, our languid souls inspire,
For here, we trust, thou art!
Send down a coal of heav’nly fire,
To warm each waiting heart.
Show us some token of Thy love,
Our fainting hope to raise;
And pour Thy blessings from above,
That we may render praise.
Within these walls let holy peace
And love and concord dwell;
Here give the troubled conscience ease,
The wounded spirit heal.
The feeling heart, the melting eye,
The humble mind bestow;
And shine upon us from on high,
To make our graces grow!
May we in faith receive Thy Word,
In faith present our prayers;
And, in the presence of our Lord,
Unbosom all our cares.
And may the Gospel’s joyful sound
Enforced by mighty grace,
Awaken many sinners round,
To come and fill the place.

Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are the sheep of His fold;
Dear is the love that He gives them,
Dearer than silver or gold.
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are His “other" lost sheep;
Over the mountains He follows,
Over the waters so deep.
Out in the desert they wander,
Hungry and helpless and cold;
Off to the rescue He hastens,
Bringing them back to the fold.
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are the lambs of His fold;
Some from the pastures are straying,
Hungry and helpless and cold.
See, the good Shepherd is seeking,
Seeking the lambs that are lost;
Bringing them in with rejoicing,
Saved at such infinite cost.
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are the “ninety and nine";
Dear are the sheep that have wandered,
Out in the desert to pine.
Hark! He is earnestly calling,
Tenderly pleading today;
“Will you not seek for My lost ones,
Off from My shelter astray?"
Green are the pastures inviting,
Sweet are the waters and “still";
Lord, we will answer Thee gladly,
“Yes, blessed Master, we will!
Make us Thy true under-shepherds,
Give us a love that is deep;
Send us out into the desert,
Seeking Thy wandering sheep."

Dearest Jesu, we are here,
At Thy call, Thy presence owning;
Pleading now in holy fear
That Thy sacrifice atoning;
Word incarnate, much in wonder
On this mystery deep we ponder.
Under forms of bread and wine
Simple hearts in faith adore Thee:
Born of Mary, Son divine,
Low we bow the knee before Thee
Opening heart alike and coffer,
Body, soul, to Thee we offer.
Jesu, strong to save—the same
Yesterday, today, for ever—
Make us fear and love Thy Name,
Serving Thee with best endeavor;
In this life, O ne’er forsake us,
But to bliss hereafter take us.

Dearest Jesus, draw Thou near me,
Let Thy Spirit dwell with mine;
Open now my ear to hear Thee,
Take my heart and seal it Thine;
Keep me, lead me on my way,
Thee to follow and obey,
E’er to do Thy will and fear Thee,
And rejoice to know and hear Thee.
Underneath Thy wings abiding,
In Thy Church, O Savior dear,
Let me dwell, in Thee confiding,
Hold me in Thy faith and fear;
Take away from me each thought
That with wickedness is fraught,
Tempting me to disobey Thee,
Root it out, O Lord, I pray Thee.
Thou, earth’s greatest joy and gladness,
And salvation, full and free,
Let Thy presence cheer my sadness,
And prepare my soul for Thee!
In the hour when I depart,
Touch my spirit, lips and heart,
With Thy Word assure, uphold me
Till the heav’nly gates enfold me.

Dearest of all the names above,
My Jesus, and my God,
Who can resist Thy heav’nly love,
Or trifle with Thy blood?
’Tis by the merits of Thy death
The Father smiles again;
’Tis by Thine interceding breath
The Spirit dwells with men.
Till God in human flesh I see,
My thoughts no comfort find;
The holy, just, and sacred Three
Are terrors to my mind.
But if Immanuel’s face appear,
My hope, my joy begins;
His Name forbids my slavish fear,
His grace removes my sins.
While Jews on their own law rely,
And Greeks of wisdom boast,
I love th’incarnate mystery
And there I fix my trust.

Dearest Savior, help thy servant
To proclaim thy wondrous love!
Pour thy grace upon this people,
That thy truth they may approve;
Bless, O bless them, Bless O bless them
From thy shining courts above.
Now thy gracious word invites them
To partake the gospel feast;
Let thy Spirit sweetly draw them 
Every soul be Jesus guest!
O receive us, O receive us.
Let us find the promised rest.

Low in the grave He sleeps,
Cold in the tomb,
Now o’er my Savior sweeps
Death’s sable gloom.
Hark! I hear an angel voice:
“He is not here, He’s risen." 
Glory! glory! shout the joyful strain!
Christ is risen, evermore to reign!
Hallelujah! shout with every breath!
Christ has triumphed over death.
Closed are His pilgrim toils,
Suffering one,
Death now around Him coils
God’s only Son.
Hark! I hear an angel voice:
“He is not here, He’s risen." 
Just as the dawn is seen,
With anxious feet
Comes Mary Magdalene
With spices sweet.
Hark! I hear an angel voice:
“He is not here, He’s risen." 
Jesus has conquered death,
Shout the glad strain!
Burst He its mighty bars,
Risen to reign.
Hark! I hear an angel voice:
“He is not here, He’s risen.".

Death hath no terrors for the blood bought one,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
The boasted vict’ry of the grave is gone,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Jesus rose from the dead,
Rose triumphant as He said,
Snatched the vict’ry from the grave,
Rose again our souls to save—
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Our souls die daily to the world and sin,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the Spirit’s power as He dwells within,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
We seek a city far beyond this vale,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Where joys celestial never, never fail,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
We’ll then press forward to the heav’nly land,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Nor mind the troubles met on ev’ry hand,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
We’ll rise some day just as our Savior rose,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Till then shall death be but a calm repose,
O glory hallelujah to the Lamb!

Sadly we sing and with tremulous breath 
As we stand by the mystical stream
In the valley and by the dark river of death
And yet 'tis no more than a dream.
Only a dream, only a dream
Of glory beyond the dark stream
How peaceful the slumber, how happy the waking
Where death is only a dream.
Why should we weep when the weary ones rest
In the bosom of Jesus supreme
In the mansions of glory prepared for the blest
For death is no more than a dream.
Naught in the river the Saints shall appall
Tho' it frightfully dismal may seem
In the arms of our Savior no ill can befall
They find it no more than a dream.
Over the turbid and on rushing tide
Doth the light of eternity gleam
And the ransomed the darkness and storm shall out ride
To wake with glad smiles from their dream.

Deceit and falsehood I abhor,
But love Thy law, Thy truth revealed;
My steadfast hope is in Thy Word;
Thou art my Refuge and my Shield;
The paths of sin I have not trod,
But kept the precepts of my God.
According to Thy gracious Word
Uphold me, Lord, deliver me;
O do not let me be ashamed
Of patient hope and trust in Thee;
O hold Thou me, and I shall stand
And ever follow Thy command.
The froward Thou hast set at naught
Who vainly wander from the right;
The wicked Thou dost count as dross;
Thy just decrees are my delight;
For fear of Thee I stand in awe
And reverence Thy most holy law.

If pathless forests meet my view,
I will not doubt or fear;
What has been done that I can do,
My way shall be made clear.
I’ve decided, Lord, that I will follow Thee,
Anywhere, anywhere,
Over the land or over the sea,
It matters not where it may be,
For I’ve decided, Lord, to follow Thee,
Anywhere.
No trackless plain my faith can dim,
Despite its vast domain;
But with my faith made strong in Him,
I’ll sing my glad .
No sea too deep nor wide for me,
With faith shall I embark;
For He Who walked on Galilee
Will safely guide my bark.
So anywhere and everywhere
In pleasure, woe or pain;
My cross alone I do not bear,
Nor do I trust in vain.

Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness,
Leave the gloomy haunts of sadness;
Come into the daylight’s splendor,
There with joy thy praises render
Unto Christ Whose grace unbounded
Hath this wondrous banquet founded.
Higher o’er all the heav’ns He reigneth,
Yet to dwell with thee He deigneth.
Hasten as a bride to meet Him
And with loving reverence greet Him;
For with words of life immortal
Now He knocketh at thy portal.
Haste to ope the gates before Him,
Saying, while thou dost adore Him,
Suffer, Lord, that I receive Thee,
And I nevermore will leave Thee.
He who craves a precious treasure
Neither cost nor pain will measure;
But the priceless gifts of heaven
God to us hath freely given.
Though the wealth of earth were offered,
Naught would buy the gifts here offered:
Christ’s true body, for thee riven,
And His blood, for thee once given.
Ah, how hungers all my spirit
For the love I do not merit!
Oft have I, with sighs fast thronging,
Thought upon this food with longing,
In the battle well nigh worsted,
For this cup of life have thirsted,
For the Friend Who here invites us
And to God Himself unites us.
In my heart I find ascending
Holy awe, with rapture blending,
As this mystery I ponder,
Filling all my soul with wonder,
Bearing witness at this hour
Of the greatness of God’s power;
Far beyond all human telling
Is the power within Him dwelling.
Human reason, though it ponder,
Cannot fathom this great wonder
That Christ’s body e’er remaineth
Though it countless souls sustaineth
And that He His blood is giving
With the wine we are receiving.
These great mysteries unsounded
Are by God alone expounded.
Sun, Who all my life dost brighten,
Light, Who dost my soul enlighten;
Joy the best that any knoweth;
Fount, whence all my being floweth;
At Thy feet I cry, my Maker,
Let me be a fit partaker
Of this blessed food from heaven,
For our good, Thy glory, given.
Lord, by love and mercy driven
Thou hast left Thy throne in heaven
On the cross for me to languish
And to die in bitter anguish,
To forego all joy and gladness
And to shed Thy blood in sadness.
By this blood redeemed and living,
Lord, I praise Thee with thanksgiving.
Jesus, Bread of Life, I pray Thee,
Let me gladly here obey Thee.
By Thy love I am invited,
Be Thy love with love requited;
From this supper let me measure,
Lord, how vast and deep love’s treasure.
Through the gifts Thou here dost give me
As Thy guest in heaven receive me.

When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
That means all the world to me.
Now tonight the old home place is lonely
Since Mother has been called away
And I know I can never more see her
Til we meet on that decoration day
When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
That means all the world to me.
I remember the night the angels called her
To live on that beautiful shore
And it left us so lonely here without her
It can never be home anymore.
When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
That means all the world to me.
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
That means all the world to me.

We're dedicated to the Lord
We sing His praises and we teach His word
If you're wond'ring what we're trying to say
We're dedicated, dedicated to stay
Jesus came and suffered, He died to set us free
That we could see what love is and live eternally
He is our King and Savior, He cleansed us from our sin
And by our dedication we show our love for Him
Jesus, supreme example, we'll find no better friend
So we should be dedicated and strive to live like Him
He is the greatest servant, He washed disciples feet
And by His dedication our lives can be complete
We're dedicated to the Lord (

Deem not that they are blest alone
Whose days a peaceful tenor keep;
Th’anointed Son of God makes known
A blessing for the eyes that weep.
The light of smiles shall fill again
The lids that overflow with tears;
And weary hours of woe and pain
Are promises of happier years.
There is a day of sunny rest
For every dark and troubled night;
And grief shall bide an evening guest,
But joy shall come with early light.
Nor let the good man’s trust depart,
Though life its common gifts deny,
Though with a pierced and broken heart,
And spurned of men, he goes to die.
For God has marked each sorrowing day,
And numbered every secret tear;
And heaven’s long age of bliss shall pay
For all His children suffer here.

Deep and deeper fell the shadows,
Nearer seemed the golden strand,
And my trusting heart was waiting,
Passive in my Savior’s hands;
O how brightly o’er my spirit
Came a radiance from afar,
Like the blush of early morning,
Like the rising of a star.
I was waiting, calmly waiting,
Not a fear was in my breast;
I had trusted my Redeemer,
And in Him was now my rest.
Nearer seemed the shining portals,
But the Master said to me,
?There are sheaves that must be garnered
Ere the reaping dawns for thee;
Yet I know that thou wert weary,
And I bade thy heart repose
By a healing stream that murmurs
Where the Rose of Sharon grows.?
In the silent hours of midnight,
When my waking thoughts take wings,
O the tranquil peace He gives me,
And the hallowed songs He brings!
He has crowned me with His blessing,
And I now by faith can say,
I am going forth with vigor,
Still rejoicing on my way.

Deep and grand in tones sublime,
Hear the passing bells of time,
Ring the dirge of moments dead,
Golden hours whose joys are fled—
Still those bells of time we hear,
Tolling, tolling: Hark! the word:
Eternity!
Eternity!
Eternity!
In the rosy morning fair,
In the sultry noonday glare,
In the dewy evening bright,
In the silent hush of night—
Still those bells of time we hear,
Tolling, tolling, loud and clear:
When with breaking heart we bend,
O’er a tried and faithful friend,
When the parting hour draws nigh,
And we catch the last “goodbye"—
Still those bells of time we hear,
Tolling, tolling, loud and clear:
Precious word! if safe we stand
On the Christian’s borderland
Trusting Him, Whose loving smile
Lights and cheers us all the while—
Bells of time with joy we hear,
Tolling, tolling, sweet and clear:

Into the heart of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go,
Seeking to know the reason
Why He should love me so,
Why He should stoop to lift me
Up from the miry clay,
Saving my soul, making me whole,
Though I had wandered away.
Into the will of Jesus,
Deeper and deeper I go,
Praying for grace to follow,
Seeking His way to know;
Bowing in full surrender
Low at His blessed feet,
Bidding Him take, break me and make,
Till I am molded, complete.
Into the cross of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go,
Following through the garden,
Facing the dreaded foe;
Drinking the cup of sorrow,
Sobbing with broken heart,
“O Savior, help! Dear Savior, help!
Grace for my weakness impart."
Into the joy of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go,
Rising, with soul enraptured,
Far from the world below.
Joy in the place of sorrow,
Peace in the midst of pain,
Jesus will give, Jesus will give;
He will uphold and sustain.
Into the love of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go,
Praising the One Who brought me
Out of my sin and woe;
And through eternal ages
Gratefully I shall sing,
“O how He loved! O how He loved!
Jesus, my Lord and my King!.

Deeper deeper in the love of Jesus
Daily let me go
Higher, higher in the school of wisdom
More of grace to know
Ch: O deep.er yet I pray
And higher every day
And wiser blessed Lord
In Thy precious Holy word
Deeper, deeper, blessed Holy Spirit
Take me deeper still
Till my life is holly spent in Jesus
And His perfect will
Deeper, deeper though it cost hard trails
Deeper let me go
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus
Let me fruitful grow
Deeper, higher, every day in Jesus
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conq'ror, and His own image
Perfected at last.

There is a longing only You can fill
A raging tempest only You can still
My soul is thirsty Lord to know You
As I’m known
Drink from the river that flows
Before Your throne
Take me deeper, deeper in love with You
Jesus hold me close in Your embrace
Take me deeper
Deeper than I’ve ever been before
I just want to love You more and more
How I long to be deeper in love
Sunrise to sunrise I will seek Your face
Drawn by the Spirit
To the promise of Your grace
My heart has found in You
A hope that will abide
Here in Your presence forever satisfied

In the blood from the cross,
I have been washed from sin;
But to be free from dross,
Still I would enter in.
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.
Day by day, hour by hour,
Blessings are sent to me;
But for more of His power,
Ever my prayer shall be.
Near to Christ I would live,
Following Him each day;
What I ask He will give;
So then with faith I pray.
Now I have peace, sweet peace,
While in this world of sin;
But to pray I’ll not cease
Till I am pure within.

Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher in the school of wisdom,
More of grace to know.
O deeper yet, I pray,
And higher every day,
And wiser, blessed Lord,
In Thy precious, holy Word.
Deeper, deeper, blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.
Deeper, deeper! though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.
Deeper, higher, every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqu’ror, and in His own image
Perfected at last.
Deeper, deeper in the faith of Jesus,
Holy faith and true;
In His pow’r and soul exulting wisdom
Let me peace pursue.

Defend us, Lord, from every ill;
Strengthen our hearts to do Thy will;
In all we plan and all we do,
Still keep us to Thy service true.
O let us hear the inspiring word
Which they of old at Horeb heard;
Breathe to our hearts the high command,
“Go onward and possess the land!"
Thou Who are light, shine on each soul!
Thou Who are truth, each mind control!
Open our eyes and make us see
The path which leads to Heaven and Thee!

Words: Bob Allsup and Gary Ferguson 

Delay not, delay not, O sinner, draw near.
The waters of life are now flowing for thee;
No price is demanded, the Savior is here;
Redemption is purchased, salvation is free.
Delay not, delay not, why longer abuse
The love and compassion of Jesus thy God?
A fountain is open, how canst thou refuse
To wash and be cleansed in His pardoning blood?
Delay not, delay not, the Spirit of grace,
Long grieved and resisted, may take His sad flight,
And leave thee in darkness to finish thy race,
To sink in the gloom of eternity’s night.
Delay not, delay not, the hour is at hand,
The earth shall dissolve, and the heavens shall fade;
The dead, small and great, in the judgment shall stand;
What helper, then, sinner, shall lend thee his aid.

Deliver me from evil, preserve me, Lord, from wrong;
Against the foes that gather be Thou my Helper strong;
From those who plot to hurt me and spread the treacherous snare,
Preserve me, Lord, and keep me safeguarded in Thy care.
O Lord, I have confessed Thee to be my God alone;
O hear my supplication, and be Thy mercy shown;
O God the Lord, my Savior, my Shield amid the strife,
Let not the wicked triumph who plot against my life.
Let evil smite the evil, and cause their overthrow;
The needy and afflicted the Lord will help, I know;
Thy saints, redeemed from evil, their thanks to Thee shall give;
The righteous and the upright shall in Thy presence live.

I saw a wayworn traveler, in tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad;
His back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone,
Yet he shouted as he journeyed, “Deliverance will come!"
Then palms of victory, crowns of glory,
Palms of victory I shall wear.
The summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow,
His garments worn and dusty, his step seemed very slow;
But he kept pressing onward, for he was wending home,
Still shouting as he journeyed, “Deliverance will come!"
The songsters in the arbor that stood beside the way
Attracted his attention, inviting his delay:
His watchword being “Onward!" he stopped his ears and ran,
Still shouting as he journeyed, “Deliverance will come!"
I saw him in the evening; the sun was bending low;
He’d overtopped the mountain, and reached the vale below:
He saw the Golden City—his everlasting home—
And shouted loud, “Hosanna! Deliverance will come!"
While gazing on that city, just o’er the narrow flood,
A band of holy angels came from the throne of God;
They bore him on their pinions safe o’er the dashing foam,
And joined him in his triumph: Deliverance had come!
I heard the song of triumph they sang upon that shore,
Saying, “Jesus has redeemed us to suffer nevermore!"
Then casting his eyes backward on the race which he had run,
He shouted loud, “Hosanna! Deliverance has come!"

Lord he thought he'd make a man
Dem bones gonna rise again
Took a little water, took a little sand
Dem bones goona rise again 
I know it, know it,
Indeed I know it -
Brother, I know it, Whee!
Dem bones gonna rise again.
Put him in that garden fair
Dem bones gonna rise again
Saw him mighty lonely there
Dem bones gonna rise again
Took a rib from Adam's side
Dem bones gonna rise again
Made Miss Eve to be his bride.
Dem bones gonna rise again.
Put them in that garden fair
Dem bones gonna rise again
Saw them mighty happy there.
Dem bones gonna rise again
Apples, peaches, pears and such
Dem bones gonna rise again
But one fruit you must not touch.
Dem bones gonna rise again
Round that tree old Satan slunk
Dem bones gonna rise again
At Miss Eve his eye he wunk.
Dem bones gonna rise again
My that fruit looks mighty fine
Dem bones gonna rise again
Take a bite, the Lord won't mind.
Dem bones gonna rise again
So she took a pick and she took a pull
Dem bones gonna rise again
Then she filled her apron full.
Dem bones gonna rise again
Next day when the Lord came round
Dem bones gonna rise again
Saw those cores all over the ground.
Dem bones gonna rise again
1Adam, Adam, where art thou?
Dem bones gonna rise again
Here I am Lord, coming now!
Dem bones gonna rise again
1Adam who these cores did leave?
Dem bones gonna rise again
Wasn't me Lord, must a been Eve.
Dem bones gonna rise again
1Adam you must leave this place
Dem bones gonna rise again
Earn your bread by the sweat of your face.
Dem bones gonna rise again
1So he took a pick and he took a plow
Dem bones gonna rise again
And that's why we're all singing now.
Dem bones gonna rise again
1This is the end, there ain't no more
Dem bones gonna rise again
Eve got the apple, Adam got the core.
Dem bones gonna rise again
1Moral of the story be
Dem bones gonna rise again
Don't leave your cores for the Lord to see.
Dem bones gonna rise again

On the golden streets of heaven all men hope to walk some day,
Yet so many are not willing to accept the living way;
But while others build on good works, or opinions if they may,
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
I'm depending on the blood.
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Saviour,
I've been washed in the crimson flood;
Tho' the world may say there is hope some other way,
I'm depending on the blood.
Some will tell us that God's mercy is their only hope and plea,
That a soul He could not punish throughout all eternity;
But I read that my dear Saviour died for sinners just like me,
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
I'm depending on the blood.
As we look back thro' the ages where the kings and prophets trod,
We may see their altars reeking with the sacrifice and blood;
But those types were only pointing to the Paschal Lamb of God,
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
I'm depending on the blood.
'Tis the burden of that over on the streets of light,
That the blood from Calv'ry's mountain has washed all their garments white;
So I'll shout along life's pathway till I reach that land so bright:
"Hallelujah! hallelujah!
I'm depending on the blood.".

Depth of mercy! Can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear,
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?
I have long withstood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face,
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.
I have spilt His precious blood,
Trampled on the Son of God,
Filled with pangs unspeakable,
I, who yet am not in hell!
I my Master have denied,
I afresh have crucified,
And profaned His hallowed Name,
Put Him to an open shame.
Whence to me this waste of love?
Ask my Advocate above!
See the cause in Jesus’ face,
Now before the throne of grace.
Jesus, answer from above,
Is not all Thy nature love?
Wilt Thou not the wrong forget,
Permit me to kiss Thy feet?
If I rightly read Thy heart,
If Thou all compassion art,
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,
Pardon and accept me now.
Jesus speaks, and pleads His blood!
He disarms the wrath of God;
Now my Father’s mercies move,
Justice lingers into love.
Kindled His relentings are,
Me He now delights to spare,
Cries, “How shall I give thee up?"
Lets the lifted thunder drop.
Lo! I still walk on the ground:
Lo! an Advocate is found:
“Hasten not to cut Him down,
Let this barren soul alone."
There for me the Savior stands,
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands.
God is love! I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps and loves me still.
Pity from Thine eye let fall,
By a look my soul recall;
Now the stone to flesh convert,
Cast a look, and break my heart.
Now incline me to repent,
Let me now my sins lament,
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

When I am taken from this world of sadness,
With what joy I'll seek the skies!
Jesus I'll hasten to thine arms with gladness,
Heav'n is all I seek or prize.
Blest abode, fair Sion loved and cherished,
When earthly joys have faded and perished,
Oh let me Thy splendors behold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold;
Then let me taste thy joys untold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold.
Quickly depart! oh cruel momments hasten!
Shall mine exile ne'er have end?
When shall these sorrows cease my heart to chasten?
Jesus soon Thy summons send.
Blest abode, fair Sion loved and cherished,
When earthly joys have faded and perished,
Oh let me Thy splendors behold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold;
Then let me taste thy joys untold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold.
Heaven has no sadness, sorrow or sighing,
There I'll mourn and weep no more;
There is no grief, no sickness or dying
On that bright unfading shore.
Blest abode, fair Sion loved and cherished,
When earthly joys have faded and perished,
Oh let me Thy splendors behold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold;
Then let me taste thy joys untold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold.
Ever more I hear their angel voices pealing,
From my soul soft echoes rise;
Brightly around me dreams of bliss are stealing
Of my home beyond the skies.
Blest abode, fair Sion loved and cherished,
When earthly joys have faded and perished,
Oh let me Thy splendors behold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold;
Then let me taste thy joys untold,
Then let me taste thy joys untold.

Jesus, you are the light of every nation
King of your creation and you reign
Jesus, you hold the kingdoms and the powers
The glory in this hour and you reign
Jesus, Prince of Peace
Your kingdom will never cease
Desire of the nations
Our great expectation
Lord, come fill this house with your glory
Desire of the nations
Our heart's invitation
Come fill this house with your glory
The kingdoms of this world are becoming 
The kingdoms of our Lord

You are boundless mercy
You are endless grace
You are sweet forgiveness
Ceaseless faithfulness
Washing over me
You are sovereign Father
You are healing King
You are tender Savior
Righteous offering
Poured out for me
And I surrender to you
Lord I'm yielding all I am to you
You have captivated me
And I come to give my devotion

As each long day rolls by and falls behind me
In the lonely night there's a peacefulness I've found
Though I'm weary even then when I rise to start again
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown.
I have wasted all that life has laid before me
I have watched as all the green fields turned to brown
But I shall not disavow all these ties that bind me now
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown
Shining down some day I know
Brighter than all their streets of gold
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down
And the sorrows I have known 
I'll see them all be overthrown
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown.
With the passing of the years I will grow stronger
Just as sure as this old world keeps spinning round
Then the closer I will be to my Sweetest Victory
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown

While walking out one ev'ning, not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away before we held our show
I heard the Bethal's mission band they sang with all their might
I gave my heart to Jesus and I left the show that night.
The day will soon be over and digging will be done
No more gems to be gathered now so let us all press on
When Jesus comes to claim us all and says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining but no longer in the rough.
One day my precious comrades, you too were lost in sin
And others sought to rescue but 'twas Jesus took you in
And when you're tired and tempted too and scoffed by sin's rebuff
Don't turn away in anger you're a diamond in the rough.
While reading through the Bible, what wondrous sites I see
I read of Peter, James and John, by the sea of Galilee
And Jesus, when He found them there He found them very tough
And they were precious diamonds that He gathered in the rough.

Did Christ o’er sinners weep,
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
Burst forth from every eye.
The Son of God in tears
The wondering angels see:
Be thou astonished, O my soul;
He shed those tears for thee.
He wept that we might weep;
Each sin demands a tear;
In heaven alone no sin is found,
And there’s no weeping there.

Did Christ the Great Example Lead
For all His humble train,
In washing the disciples' feet,
And wiping them again?
And did my Lord and Master say,
"If I have washed your feet,
Ye also ought to watch and pray,
And wash each other's feet?"
O blessed Jesus, at thy board
I have thy children met;
The bread I've broke, the wine I've poured
We've washed each other's feet
In imitation of my Lord,
Who blood for me did sweat,
I yield unto His sacred word
And wash the pilgrim's feet.
Yes, blessed Jesus, I like thee.
Would Christians often meet;
The least of all the flock would be.
And wash His children's feet.

Ere you left your room this morning,
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ our Savior,
Did you sue for loving favor,
As a shield today?
O how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Don’t forget to pray.
When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit,
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay?
When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way?
When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates of day?

Forty days forty nights when the rain kept fallin’,
The wicked climb the tree, and for help kept a callin’,
For they heard the waters wailin’,
Didn’t it rain, rain,
Didn’t it rain!
Tell me Noah didn’t it rain!
Some climb the mountain, some climb the hill,
Some started sailin’ an’ a rowin’ with a will;
Some tried swimming an’ I guess they’re swimmin’ still.
For they heard the waters roarin’!
Didn’t it rain, rain,
Didn’t it rain!
Tell me Noah didn’t it rain!

Two paths to choose mine or His
Will I follow or will I stray?

(Without You) Without You I’m inadequate and powerless to succeed
Callin’ out for Your wisdom, for the moving of Your hand
Asking You for Your guidance and the courage to take a stand
That’s how Daniel faced the lions, and Moses split that sea
That’s how I’ll make a difference, by the Spirit of God in me

How can I make a difference?

Ding dong! Merrily on high, in Heav’n the bells are ringing,
Ding dong! Verily the sky is riv’n with angel singing.
Gloria, hosannah in the highest!
E’en so here below, below, let steeple bells be swungen,
And io, io, io, by priest and people sungen.
Gloria, hosannah in the highest!
Pray ye dutifully, prime your matin chime, ye ringers;
May ye beautifully rime your evetime song, ye singers.
Gloria, hosannah in the highest!

Disciples of all nations,
The Lord calls us to make,
Baptizing new believers
And making idols shake.
He shows us the examples,
Of how we should respond,
In Scripture stories glorious
Of servants now long gone.
Like Samuel in the temple,
When came the midnight call,
Obedient to his master,
He hurried down the hall.
Not fully understanding,
Ignoring any fears,
He gave courageous answer,
“Speak, Lord, Your servant hears."
Like Gideon of Manasseh,
We think ourselves too small,
But God the Lord is with us,
A tower that cannot fall.
We need no mighty army,
No weapons made of man;
Watch God supply the helpers,
And then reveal the plan.
As Abraham gave Isaac,
As parents so may we
Be asked to give our children
For service full and free.
If asked, then, do not falter,
But send them on their way
To spread the wondrous tidings,
That night may turn to day.
As Moses stood in Egypt,
And God gave words to speak,
So will He give us boldness,
Though we be frail and weak.
His Spirit will empower us
To reach the sinner’s heart
And bring the lost to Jesus,
As destined from the start.
Like Samson consecrated,
If we stay true to God,
He gives us strength and power,
The Spirit’s mighty rod.
But if we fall away, then,
Our weakness will return;
So pray, stay loyal, faithful,
And God His might will lend.
Like Paul, there may be suffering,
And heavy the demands,
But heed not the rejection,
And hold to His commands.
“Teach all that I have taught you,
As witnesses be true;
Tell all the world My Gospel,
And I will be with you."

Dismiss me not Thy service, Lord,
But train me for Thy will;
For even I, in fields so broad,
Some duties may fulfill;
And I will ask for no reward,
Except to serve Thee still.
How many serve, how many more
May to the service come;
To tend the vines, the grapes to store,
Thou dost appoint for some;
Thou hast Thy young men at the war,
Thy little ones at home.
All works are good, and each is best
As most it pleases Thee;
Each worker pleases, when the rest
He serves in charity;
And neither man nor work unblest
Wilt Thou permit to be.
Our Master all the work hath done
He asks of us today;
Sharing his service, every one
Share too His Sonship may:
Lord, I would serve and be a son;
Dismiss me not, I pray.

Disposer supreme, and Judge of the earth,
Who choosest for Thine the weak and the poor;
To frail earthen vessels and things of no worth
Entrusting Thy riches which aye shall endure.
Those vessels soon fail, though full of Thy light,
And at Thy decree, are broken and gone;
Thence brightly appeareth Thy truth in its might,
As through the clouds riven the lightnings have shone.
Like clouds they are borne to do Thy great will,
And swift as the winds about the world go;
The Word with His wisdom their spirits doth fill,
They thunder, they lighten, the waters o’erflow.
Their sound goeth forth, “Christ Jesus the Lord";
Then Satan doth fear, his citadels fall;
As when the dread trumpets went worth at Thy Word,
And one long blast shattered the Canaanite’s wall.
O loud be their trump, and stirring their sound,
To rouse us, O Lord, from slumber of sin;
The lights Thou hast kindled in darkness around,
O may they illumine our spirits within.
All honor and praise, dominion and might,
To God, Three in One, eternally be;
Who round us hath shed His own marvelous light,
And called us from darkness His glory to see.

As it fell out upon one day,
Rich Dives made a feast,
And he invited all his friends,
And gentry of the best.
Then Lazarus laid him down and down
And down at Dives’ door:
“Some meat and drink, brother, Diverus,
Bestow upon the poor."
“Thou’rt none of my brothers, Lazarus,
That liest begging at my door;
No meat, nor drink will I give thee,
Nor bestow upon the poor."
Then Lazarus laid him down and down,
All under Dives’ wall:
“Some meat, some drink, brother Diverus,
For hunger starve I shall."
“Thou’rt none of my brothers, Lazarus,
That liest begging at my gate;
No meat, no drink will I give thee,
For Jesus Christ His sake."
Then Dives sent out his hungry dogs,
To bite him as he lay;
They hadn’t the power to bite one bite,
But licked his sores away.
Then Dives sent to his merry men,
To worry poor Lazarus away;
They’d not the power to strike one stroke,
But flung their whips away.
As it fell out upon one day,
Poor Lazarus sickened and died;
There came two angels out of heaven,
His soul therein to guide.
“Rise up! rise up! brother Lazarus,
And go along with me;
For you’ve a place prepared in heaven,
To sit on an angel’s knee."
As it fell out upon one day,
Rich Dives sickened and died;
There came two serpents out of hell,
His soul therein to guide.
“Rise up! rise up! brother Diverus,
And come along with me;
There is a place provided in hell
For wicked men like thee."
Then Dives looked up with his eyes
And saw poor Lazarus blest;
“Give me one drop of water, brother Lazarus,
To quench my flaming thirst."
“O, was I now but alive again
The space of one half hour!
O, that I had my peace again
Then the devil should have no power."

Onward go the sunbeams,
Shining all the day;
Looking down upon us,
Now they seem to say:
Let your smile be cheerful,
Ever warm and bright,
Make the hearts around you
Happy with its light.
Marching on together,
Thro’ this fleeting world below,
Helping one another
Onward as we go;
Think of what a blessing,
God the Father gave to man,
Try and do for others
All the good you can;
Let your smile be cheerful,
Ever warm and bright,
Make the hearts around you
Happy with its light.
Hearts and hands to Jesus,
Gladly we will give,
In the path of duty,
Walking while we live;
Cheering on the sad ones,
Lifting those that fall,
Shining like the sunbeams,
Doing good to all.
With a loving spirit,
While the days are bright,
Let us work rejoicing,
Till the dewy night;
Grateful for the blessings
Jesus brought to man,
Let us do for others
All the good we can.

Sometimes my little heart can’t understand
What’s in Your will what’s in Your plan
So many times I’m tempted to ask You why
But I can never forget it for long
Lord what You do could not be wrong
So I believe You even when I must cry
Do I trust You Lord does the robin sing
Do I trust You Lord does it rain in Spring
You can see my heart You can read my mind
And You’ve got to know I would rather die
Than to lose my faith in the One I love
Do I trust You Lord?
Do I trust You?
I know the answers I’ve given them all
But suddenly now I feel so small
Shaken down to the cavity in my soul
I know the doctrine and theology
But right now they don’t mean much to me
This time there’s only one thing I’ve got to know
Do I trust You Lord does the river flow
Do I trust You Lord does the North wind blow
You can see my heart You can read my mind
And You’ve got to know I would rather die
Than to lose my faith in the One I love
Do I trust You Lord
Do I trust you
I will trust You Lord when I don’t know why
I will trust You Lord ‘til the day I die
I will trust You Lord when I’m blind with pain
You were God before and You’ll never change
I will trust You, I will trust You Lord
I will trust You Lord
I will trust You, I will trust You Lord
I will trust You Lord
I will trust You, I will trust You Lord
I will trust You Lord

Do no sinful action,
Speak no angry word;
Ye belong to Jesus,
Children of the Lord.
Christ is kind and gentle,
Christ is pure and true;
And His little children
Must be holy, too.
There’s a wicked spirit
Watching round you still,
And he tries to tempt you
To all harm and ill.
But ye must not hear him,
Though ’tis hard for you
To resist the evil,
And the good to do.
For ye promised truly,
In your infant days,
To renounce him wholly,
And forsake his ways.
Ye are newborn Christians,
Ye must learn to fight
With the bad within you,
And to do the right.
Christ is your own Master,
He is good and true,
And His little children
Must be holy, too.

Robert C.Guy 
Do not be afraid, for I am with you
Do not be afraid, declares the Lord
Do not be afraid, for I am with you
And will rescue you forever more 
Moses led his band to the promised land
Everyone was scared that there'd be a fight
So they sent some men to see if they would win
If they were to challenge the Canaanites
Ten of the men were afraid of that land
Thinking they would be better off dead
Caleb and Joshua had different thoughts
And this is what they said, they said...
Jeremiah floored himself before the Lord
God had told him that he was set apart
He would be God's hand, a prophet to the land
He should do all that the Lord commands
Jeremiah said, "I am only a boy
And I don't even konw the right words"
The Lord reached down and touched his mouth
And this is what he heard
I can't see far ahead of me
Dark storms cloud my view
Take courage and you will see
Give it to God and he will rescue you
And will rescue you forever
And will rescue you forever
And will resuce you forevermore
Evermore

Do not be surprised at the suffering you bear;
It’s not something strange, so you must not despair.
Rejoice that you share with Christ and His sufferings know;
When He comes in glory, your joy will o’erflow.
If God should will that you suffer ill,
Commit yourself gladly His will to fulfill.
If you are insulted because of Christ’s Name,
You’re blessed, for God’s Spirit on you will remain.
Your suffering should never be for what deserves blame;
But if for your faith you’re hurt, be not ashamed.
God’s judgment will start with His own family.
What then will the outcome for godless men be?
In spite of your suffering, do good to all men;
For God will be faithful to you to the end.

Do not I love Thee, O my Lord?
Behold my heart and see;
And turn each cursed idol out,
That dares to rival Thee.
Do not I love Thee, O my Lord?
Then let me nothing love;
Dead be my heart to every joy,
When Jesus cannot move.
Is not Thy Name melodious still
To mine attentive ear?
Doth not each pulse with pleasure bound
My Savior’s voice to hear?
Hast Thou a lamb in all Thy flock
I would disdain to feed?
Hast Thou a foe, before whose face
I fear Thy cause to plead?
Would not mine ardent spirit vie
With angels round the throne,
To execute Thy sacred will,
And make Thy glory known?
Would not my heart pour forth its blood
In honor of Thy Name?
And challenge the cold hand of death
To damp th’immortal flame?
Thou know’st I love Thee, dearest Lord,
But O, I long to soar
Far from the sphere of mortal joys,
And learn to love Thee more!

Do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do,
Do not wait to shed your light afar,
To the many duties ever near you now be true,
Brighten the corner where you are.
Brighten the corner where you are!
Brighten the corner where you are!
Someone far from harbor you may guide across the bar;
Brighten the corner where you are!
Just above are clouded skies that you may help to clear,
Let not narrow self your way debar;
Though into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer,
Brighten the corner where you are.
Here for all your talent you may surely find a need,
Here reflect the bright and Morning Star;
Even from your humble hand the Bread of Life may feed,
Brighten the corner where you are.

Do not worry for your life,
What you’ll eat or drink or wear;
Is not life much more important 
Than these things that cause you care?
See the birds—they sow and reap not,
Nor in barns do store away.
Yet your heav’nly Father feeds them;
Have you not more worth than they?
And why worry about clothing?
See the lilies’ glad array;
Solomon in all his splendor
Never dressed as fine as they.
This is how God clothes the grasses,
Though their life is but a day.
Will He not much more meet your needs?
Let your faith not fade away.
So I tell you, do not worry,
Asking what you’ll eat or drink.
Nor be anxious about clothing—
These are things that all men seek.
And your Father knows you need them;
Worry won’t command His power.
Which of you by constant fretting
Adds to life a single hour?
Seek first, then, your Father’s kingdom
And His righteousness on high.
All these things will then be given;
God will not neglect your cry.
So fret not about tomorrow;
God directs the future, too.
Though each day will bring its troubles,
Trust in Him—He’ll see you through.

Just can't keep on living like we're living
Pushing to the limits, yeah
I know that He gave His life for me
Set all our spirits free
So I wanna do right, wanna do right, I've gotta do right
I never dreamed that I could be holding you
Well He's making my dreams come true
So I wanna do right, wanna do right
I wanna do right
Oh, you got to do right (echo throughout: do right, do right)
Yes you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light
Yes you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light (Lord I wanna do right)
Listen to me people (Lord I wanna do right)
(Lord I wanna do right, yeah, yeah)
I used to say love was just a game we played
Now I see it in a different way
So I wanna do right (wanna do right), I gotta do right (got to do right)
And I never knew that I could be holding you
Well He's making my dreams come true
So I wanna do right, wanna do right
I wanna do right (got to, got to do right)
Well we just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
We just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
We just can't keep on pushin' to the limit
We just can't keep on (pushin')
Just can't keep on livin' like we're livin' (pushin')
We just can't keep on pushin' to the limit (pushin')
We just can't keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on (pushin')
Oh, you got to do right (echo throughout: do right, do right)
Yes you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light
Yes you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light
Yes you gotta do right
You've got to, you've got to
Do right, do right

Our Lord and His disciples at table were as one,
And Jesus thought of the morrow, His work here nearly done.
With one last night together, they knew not what would be,
But Jesus had one final word:
“Do This; Remember Me!"
Thanksgiving to the Father, an ancient feast made new.
Christ said, “This is My body, My body giv’n for you."
The holy bread was broken and shared with Jesus’ plea
That His words not be forgotten:
“Do This; Remember Me!"
He took the cup of blessing, the blood of Jesus shed
That all might know forgiveness, received when Jesus bled.
Salvation now available to all on bended knee
Who repent and follow His command:
“Do This; Remember Me!"
Yes, Christ’s command continues to all who serve His Name
To go and make disciples, that all would sing His fame.
And gathered at one table His holy church shall see
Our Master is still calling:
“Do This; Remember Me!"

To the Syrian camp at twilight,
Hungry, thirsty, bleeding, sore,
Came four leprous men of Israel;
Found they there abundant store—
Gold and silver, food and raiment,
“We must go the message tell,
’Tis a day of joyful tidings,
Waiting here, we do not well." 
’Tis the day of full salvation,
Go, the joyful message tell;
While we wait the millions perish,
And we do not well.
Do we well, my precious brethren?
While they starve and die for bread,
We, with heaven’s richest blessings,
Are so bountifully fed;
If we tarry till the morning,
Mischief shall our souls befall—
Go and tell earth’s dying millions,
There is bread enough for all.
India’s lost ones still are crying,
From that sin-benighted land;
Hear those wails from darkest China,
And from Egypt’s sunlit strand;
While a soul remains in darkness,
And in idleness we dwell,
Selfishly the truth enjoying,
Brethren, dear, we do not well.
While a few have crossed the ocean,
Leaving all for Jesus’ name,
There is room for many others—
Go, the gospel news proclaim!
Those who roam in sin’s dominion
Can be rescued yet from hell,
While a moment’s left to save them;
If we wait, we do not well.
If we labor on for Jesus,
And to every dying one
Tell the glad and joyful tidings,
Till life’s fleeting day is done,
When we stand before the judgment,
While our hearts with rapture swell,
We shall hear the Savior saying,
“Ye have done exceeding well." 

Do what it says, have faith
Look into the Word and go through with it
Do what it says, have faith
Your actions speak louder than words 
Is it good when he boasts of faith 
And does nothing
Can such faith save him?
He sees the sick and the poor and then he does nothing
Faith by itself is dead
He says be well, keep warm and fed
And does nothing
Doesn't even give them bread
His actions speak louder than his words 
She's alone after 50 years
And you do something
To comfort her distress
He's so young and now he's on his own
And you do something
You live a life that God accepts
The world tries pullin' and you hold back
Then you do nothing
Pure and faultless is what God sees
Don't forget the words you have heard 
You believe there is a God (even demons believe)
Faith without deeds is nothin'
A man's faith and actions must work hand in hand (to make his faith complete)
Justified by what he does and not by faith alone 
Do what it says, have faith (read the word)
Look into the Word and go through with it
Do what it says, have faith (read the word)
Your actions speak louder than words 
Do what it says, have faith (have faith, have faith)
Look into the Word and go through with it
Do what it says, have faith (have faith, have faith)
Your actions speak louder than words

You do what you gotta do, oh what you gotta do
You do what you gotta do, oh what you gotta do
Sometimes we have to suffer trials (You do what you gotta do)
And it often may last for awhile (You do what you gotta do)
Hold on child and He'll see you through
Sometimes it just comes down to doin' what you gotta do
Someone may even curse your name (You do what you gotta do)
They'll come looking for someone to blame (You do what you gotta do)
Walk on child, all the way through
They can't take the truth from you, doin' what you gotta do

Do ye, O men, speak righteousness
And upright judgment mete?
Nay, in your hearts is wickedness,
And in your hands deceit,
And in your hands deceit.
The wicked, from their earliest days,
In sin are gone astray,
With froward heart, in foolish pride,
From wisdom turned away,
From wisdom turned away.
The God of vengeance will destroy
The wicked from His sight;
The Lord will bring to naught their power
And scatter all their might,
And scatter all their might.
The good shall triumph and rejoice,
And this shall be confessed:
On earth the God of justice reigns,
And righteousness is blest,
And righteousness is blest.

Narrative:
In those last days I tried so hard, once again, to show the people my Father’s 
way.My compassion for them ran so deep."Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often I 
have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under 
her wings, but you were not willing." I even spoke in parables of the kingdom of 
God so that they might understand.But they would not hear.This is why I spoke 
to them in parables.Though seeing they do not see, though hearing they do not 
hear or understand.In them is fulfilled the prophesy of Isaiah, “you will be 
ever hearing but never understanding, you will be ever seeing but never 
perceiving." For this people’s heart has become calloused.They hardly hear with 
their ears, and they have closed their eyes.Otherwise they might see with their 
eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would 
heal them.Sometimes I wondered if anyone had ever really heard or truly seen.
The handful of men that followed me faithfully, had they really heard, could 
they really know and believe? During the last night we spent together, I tried 
so hard to help them understand.
Do you believe in me
And in the words I say
And in Him who sent me from above
Do you believe in my love
I’ve tried so many ways to show you my love
And show you who I am
Sometimes I wonder if you’ve ever learned
Or if you understand
Do you believe in me (do you believe in me)
And in the words I say (and in the words I say)
And in Him who sent me from above (sent me from above)
Do you believe in my love (do you believe in my love)
This is my body that is broken for you
Never forget what I’ve done
This is my blood that is shed for you
This is what makes us one
Do you believe in me
And in the words I say (do you believe)
And in Him who sent me from above (in Him who sent me from above)
Do you believe in my love

Do you fear the foe will in the conflict win?
Is it dark without you—darker still within?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in.
Let a little sunshine in,
Let a little sunshine in;
Clear the darkened windows,
Open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in.
Does your faith grow fainter in the cause you love?
Are your prayers unanswered by your God above?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in.
Would you go rejoicing in the upward way,
Knowing naught of darkness, dwelling in the day?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in.

Do you hear them coming, brother,
Thronging up the steeps of light,
Clad in glorious shining garments,
Blood washed, garments pure and white?
’Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
’Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.
Do you hear the stirring anthems,
Filling all the earth and sky,
’Tis a grand, victorious army,
Lift its banner up on high!
Never fear the clouds of sorrow,
Never fear the storms of sin.
We shall triumph on the morrow,
Even now our joys begin.
Wave the banner, shout His praises,
For our victory is nigh!
We shall join our conqu’ring Savior,
We shall reign with Him on high!

Said the night wind to the little lamb, 
"Do you see what I see? 
Way up in the sky, little lamb, 
Do you see what I see? 
A star, a star, dancing in the night 
With a tail as big as a kite, 
With a tail as big as a kite." 
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, 
"Do you hear what I hear? 
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy, 
Do you hear what I hear? 
A song, a song high above the trees 
With a voice as big as the the sea, 
With a voice as big as the the sea." 
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king, 
"Do you know what I know? 
In your palace warm, mighty king, 
Do you know what I know? 
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold-- 
Let us bring him silver and gold, 
Let us bring him silver and gold." 
Said the king to the people everywhere, 
"Listen to what I say! 
Pray for peace, people, everywhere, 
Listen to what I say! 
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night 
He will bring us goodness and light, 
He will bring us goodness and light." 

Do you know how many stars
There are shining in the sky?
Do you know how many clouds
Every day go floating by?
God, the Lord, their number knoweth,
For each one His care He showeth,
Of the bright and boundless host,
Of the bright and boundless host.
Do you know how many birdies
In the sunshine sing each day?
Do you know how many fishes
In the sparkling water play?
God, the Lord, Who dwells in Heaven,
Name and life to each has given,
In His love they live and move,
In His love they live and move.
Do you know how many children
Go to little beds at night,
And without a care or sorrow
Wake again with morning light?
God in Heav’n each name can tell,
Know us, too, and loves us well,
He’s our best and dearest Friend,
He’s our best and dearest Friend.

Do you know Jesus,
Our Lord, our Savior,
Jesus the Son of God?
Have you ever seen Him,
Or shared of His favor?
Jesus the Son of God.
O sweet Wonder!
O sweet Wonder!
Jesus the Son of God;
How I adore Thee!
O how I love Thee!
Jesus the Son of God.
God gave Him, a ransom,
Our souls to recover;
Jesus the Son of God.
His blood made us worthy
His Spirit to hover;
Jesus the Son of God.
O who would reject Him,
Despise or forsake Him,
Jesus the Son of God?
O who ever sought Him,
And He would not take Him?
Jesus the Son of God.
If you will accept Him
And trust and believe Him,
Jesus the Son of God,
Your soul will exalt Him,
And never will leave Him;
Jesus the Son of God.
Then some day from heaven,
On clouds of bright glory,
Jesus the Son of God
Will come for His jewels,
Most precious and holy,
Jesus the Son of God.

Have you a heart that's weary
Tending a load of care?
Are you a soul that's seeking
Rest from the burden you bear?
Do you know (do you know) my Jesus?
Do you know (do you know) my friend?
Have you heard (have you heard) He loves you?
And that He will abide til the end (til the end)?
Who knows your disappointments?
Who hears each time you cry?
Who understands your heartaches?
Who dries the tears from your eyes?

Do you know the song that the angels sang
On that night in the long ago,
When the heavens above with their music rang
Till it echoed in the earth below?
All glory in the highest,
Peace on earth, goodwill to men,
Glory in the highest,
Peace, goodwill to men;
Glory in the highest,
Glory in the highest,
Peace on earth, goodwill to men.
Do you know the song that the shepherds heard
As they watched o’er their flocks by night,
When the skies bent down, and their hearts were stirred
By the voices of the angels bright?
Do you know the story that the wise men learned
As they journeyed from the east afar,
O’er a pathway plain, for there nightly burned
In their sight a glorious guiding star?

Do you know the song that the angels sang

Do you love the Lord?
Are you taking the time to be reading His Word?
Do you trust and obey each and every day?
Do you love the Lord?
It's not for your brother; it's not kids at school,
It's not for others to say.
Decide for yourself live the golden rule,
Only you can choose the way.
It's not for your mom and it's not for your dad,
It's not for your Sunday school class
Decide for yourself to be good, never bad,
Making your decision last.
Do you love the Lord?

Do you love the world, in its pomp and show?
In its course of sin will you onward go?
Is the pride of life more than heav’n above?
Will you lose your soul for the sins you love? 
Do you love the world? Will you selfish be,
When the Lord provides everything for thee?
Can you still refuse? Will you come and bow?
Give your heart and life to His service now? 
Do you love the world, its applause and fame?
Soon ’twill end in sorrow, remorse, and shame;
Jesus bids you come and redeem your soul
From its awful doom, ere the judgments roll.
Do you love the world? Is it dear to thee?
Can it help thy soul in eternity?
Will you choose its way more than godly fear,
Sealing thus your doom, when the Lord is near? 
Do you love the world more than Christ who died?
How the blood flowed free from His pierced side!
When it cost His life to prepare that place,
Will you die in sin, and refuse His grace? 

Do you see the Hebrew captive kneeling,
At morning, noon and night, to pray?
In his chamber he remembers Zion,
Though in exile far away.
Are your windows open toward Jerusalem,
Though as captives here, a “little while" we stay?
For the coming of the King in His glory
Are you watching day by day?
Do not fear to tread the fiery furnace,
Nor shrink the lion’s den to share;
For the God of Daniel will deliver,
He will send His angel there.
Children of the living God, take courage,
Your great deliverance sweetly sing.
Set your faces toward the hill of Zion,
Thence to hail your coming King.

Ere you left your room this morning,
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ our Savior,
Did you sue for loving favor,
As a shield today? 
Oh, how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Don’t forget to pray.
When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit,
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay? 
When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way? 
When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates of day? 

Do you want to live in glory
Oh dear friend, forevermore
Do you want a life eternal
Somewhere on that golden shore
Many times I sat there crying
As a friend was passing on
But all those times he gave me comfort
And the strength to carry on
From this world of pain and sorrow
To that golden promised land
There I'll go now Lord tomorrow
I know God will hold my hand
As my time on earth grow shorter
I'll not fear that last long day
For a better home awaits me
And sweet Jesus leads the way

You know I've got so many problems
And lately I've been feelin' kinda down
I hear Your the one I should talk to
I hear Your the best healer around
Doctor Jesus, will you help me?
Make me better, make me whole
Doctor Jesus Lord I need you
To mend my heart and save my soul
There's so many out there who need you
Do you think you could work me in
You see I'm in the worst of conditions
But mostly I just need me a friend
TO 

Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth or song,
As the burdens press, and the cares distress
And the way grows weary and long?
Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,
I know my Savior cares.
Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?
Does Jesus care when I’ve tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong;
When for my deep grief there is no relief,
Though my tears flow all the night long?
Does Jesus care when I’ve said “goodbye"
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks,
Is it aught to Him? Does He see?

And with fury lash life’s sea;
There’s peace within my soul tonight.
For my Savior dwells with me.
He will bring the peace and comfort,
Sailor, on a stormy sea;
Do you hope to reach the haven?
Does thy Savior pilot thee?
How sad to drift alone,
Tossed by every passing wave!
There is a Pilot, sin sick soul;
Christ alone thy bark can save.
A voice says, “Peace, be still,"
And sweet rest comes into life;
No longer left to fight alone,
He will guide thee through the strife.

You know I've got so many problems
And lately I've been feelin' kinda down
I hear Your the one I should talk to
I hear Your the best healer around
Doctor Jesus, will you help me?
Make me better, make me whole

TO 

Of all the things to do to a friend 
You hurt them by your tongue.
Relationships will fatally end 
Without a knife or gun.
Waitin' till you 're back behind them, 
Then you put them down 
How could you be talkin' 'bout them 
When they're not around? 
Don't be talkin' 'bout friends when they're not around
Don't be cuttin' their hearts and puttin' them down.
Don't be temptin' the Lord and makin' Him frown,
Don't be talkin' 'bout your friends when they're not around.
How all the gossip falls on our ears
It doesn't make much sense,
How we can cause the innocent tears, 
Not helping their defense.
Listening, we all should fear it, 
Listening is wrong.
If there were no one to hear it
It could not go on.
Too many friendships have been broken
By just a simple, careless word spoken.
Don't be talkin' down, throwin' down, cuttin' down friends
Why not treat them more like friends (when they're not around)?
Don't be saying lots of things, overlook the hurt it brings
Don't be talkin' bout your friends (when they're not around).

Don't cry 
Listen to the raindrops fallin'
Gently calling you to sleep
Can't you hear the raindrops fallin'
Soon you'll be in a land of dreams 
See the shadows moving on the wall (shadows on the wall)
They're only angels in disguise (angels in disguise)
There's no need to fear at all (don't fear, don't fear, don't fear, don't fear)
You're being watched by heavenly eyes (heavenly eyes) 
Don't cry (cry)
I'll always be here
Don't cry (cry)
I'll always be near

There's always a better day
Don't cry
Tomorrow's just a prayer away 
Do you feel my arms wrapped around you (arms around your shoulder)
I never want to let you go (never let you go)
There will be a day when I'll need to
I thank the Lord He's in control 
(If it rains all) If it rains all night, and it rains all day (if it)
(If it) It'll be okay (if it rains, it will be okay)
If it rains all day (if it rains all day), and it rains all night (if it rains

Everything will be all right (please don't cry) 
Don't cry (cry)

Fear not my child; the storm you hear
Will pass on through the night
The beauty of tomorrow
Will always shed new light 
Dark clouds will soon just melt away 
To bring a brighter day
So don't you fear; you're not alone
God hears you when you pray 
So I close my eyes to sleep at night
As my Father gently says
"The winds and rains your soul can't harm
So trust in Me and don't fear the storm" 
I'll shelter you and keep you safe
When rain falls on your head
I'll send My guardian angels there
To stand around your bed 
I remember Daddy telling me
That rain comes now and then
But my heav'nly Father watches me
Through nights of storms and winds 
I'll stay right here (stay right here) asleep in bed (asleep in bed)
Where it's safe and warm
The winds and rains (winds and rains) my soul can't harm (soul can't harm)
I'll trust in You and not fear the storm 
Dark clouds will soon just melt away
To bring a brighter day
So don't you fear; you're not alone
God hears you when you pray 
Interlude 
Don't fear the storm

Don't Cry 

Don’t forget the Sabbath,
The Lord our God hath blest,
Of all the week the brightest,
Of all the week the best;
It brings repose from labor,
It tells of joy divine,
Its beams of light descending,
With heav’nly beauty shine.
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
Blessed Sabbath day,
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
Blessed Sabbath day.
Keep the Sabbath holy,
And worship Him today,
Who said to His disciples,
“I am the living Way";
And if we meekly follow
Our Savior here below,
He’ll give us of the fountain
Whose streams eternal flow.
Day of sacred pleasure!
Its golden hours we’ll spend
In thankful hymns to Jesus,
The children’s dearest Friend;
O gentle, loving, Savor,
How good and kind Thou art,
How precious is Thy promise
To dwell in every heart!

If you really want to feel this way
Talk to Jesus you know everyday
You know He is a friend of mine
He's been known to even heal the blind
Just trust in Him some people say
But I know He is the only way 
Don't hesitate (hesitate, hesitate)
The day is today
Don't be afraid (don't be afraid)
Of a little change (just a little change)
Just have some faith (have some faith, have some faith)
Don't hesitate 
Why don't you give your heart to Jesus now
One day you may even wear a crown
You know we're looking for that one fine day
When we all may hear Him say
Welcome home my child come on in
Once you are forgiven of your sin 
Reach out and touch the man who died for you
Then every thing will come into view
God is alive I know you've heard it before
But if you feel Him, you know for sure
Come on and walk into the watery grave
You know immersion is the only way 
What are you waiting for? 
Just have some faith (have some faith, have some faith)
Don't hesitate

I've made mistakes the same as you
I have sinned as we all do
I can name them one by one
I must be judged for the things I've done.
Don't judge your neighbor, don't judge your neighbor
You're not the one to say he's wrong
Clean out your own house sweep out your own house
There'll be a great judgement day before long.
No one's free from sin this we know
For in the Bible it tells us so
Love everybody like God loves you
And don't harm your neighbor it's wrong if you do.
When you see a brother tossed by the way
Life full of sin forgot how to pray
Never condemn him God's will obey
He must be judged on that great judgement day

They're trying to take the Bible out of our schoolrooms
They say our children can't give thanks with prayer
But if they take our Bible out of our school rooms
Then how can this old world get anywhere
Don't let them take the Bible out of our school rooms
Don't let them close the door of your childs heart
Don't let them rob our children of salvation
If you do we're going to lose them from the start
Our leaders had a meeting up in Washington
They write that laws that keep our country free
If we cease to teach our children about Jesus
No school room could teach them what they need
Don't let them take the Bible out of our school rooms
Don't let them close the door of your childs heart
Don't let them rob our children of salvation
If you do we're going to lose them from the start
If it's right to allow liquor in most counties
On the newstand see the sinful pictures there
If it's right for moving pictures of corruption
Dear God how can we say it's wrong for prayer
Don't let them take the Bible out of our school rooms
Don't let them close the door of your childs heart
Don't let them rob our children of salvation
If you do we're going to lose them from the start

O have you had the vision, have you heard the cry
Of millions lost and perishing, O do not let them die;
Their souls have all been purchased at how great a cost!
Don’t lose the vision, keep your eye upon the cross.
Don’t lose the vision, keep your eye upon the cross;
Don’t lose the vision, or the cause will suffer loss;
If you want to reach another,
Keep in touch with Christ, my brother,
Don’t lose the vision, keep your eye upon the cross.
The young men shall see visions and the old dream dreams,
The wilderness be watered, in the desert shall be streams,
The Spirit poured upon us, cleansing from all dross,
Don’t lose the vision, keep your eye upon the cross.
Isaiah had a vision of the Lord on high
Whose train filled all the temple and he heard the seraph cry;
O Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts,
Don’t lose the vision, keep your eye upon the cross.
The vision of the prophet showed to him his sin;
He cried out, “Woe is me! for I am still unclean within";
The fire from off the altar purged his heart from dross,
Don’t lose the vision, keep your eye upon the cross.
The fields are white to harvest, have you heard the call?
The Spirit now is waiting, won’t you yield to Him our all?
The time is swiftly passing, O! the fearful loss,
Don’t lose the vision, keep your eye upon the cross.

Heaven is a city, built by jewels rare
Its beauty is a splendor yet untold
If you neglect salvation you'll never enter in
You'll never ever walk those streets of gold
So don't overlook salvation, while living here in sin
Someday it may be too late to pray
Someday when you need Him, He may not let you in
How awful if He should turn you away
Sometimes we get discouraged, while we walk this weary way
But Jesus said he'd every burden bear
So take Him all your troubles, when it seems all hope is gone
Just trust Him when you go to Him in prayer
Jesus said be ready for you know not when the hour
He may come at morning night or noon
So keep your eyes upon Him and your soul filled with His power
For you know He's surely coming soon
So don't overlook salvation, while living here in sin
Someday it may be too late to pray
Someday when you need Him, He may not let you in
How awful if He should turn you away

Don’t resist the Holy Spirit,
Sinner, heed His loving voice;
Oh, invite Him to thy bosom,
Peace shall crown that blessed choice.
Come, poor sinner, yield to Jesus,
At His throne of mercy bow;
Oh, the Spirit bids you welcome,
Come, and He will save you now.
Don’t resist the Holy Spirit,
For He comes to save thy soul;
Taste His love so kindly given,
Humbly yield to His control.
Don’t resist the Holy Spirit,
Do not grieve the gentle Dove;
He will witness sins forgiven,
And the bliss of perfect love.
Don’t resist the Holy Spirit,
He has called you oft before;
This may be His final visit,
If you open not the door.

Don't wait til judgement day to cast your sins away
If you do you're gonna see smoke and flame
Get on the ritghteous side then you won't be denied
When the Lord up yonder calls your name.
They'll be moaning, they'll be groaning when the place begins to roar
They'll be kneeling, they'll be prayin' like they never prayed before
But when all the sorting's over the Lord will show His might
Some are gonna be left, some are gonna be right.
They'll be beggin', they'll be pleadin' won't you open up the door
If you'll let me in I'll promise I'll never sin no more
But the Lord knows all that happens so you better see the light
Some are gonna be left, some are gonna be right.
They'll be sweatin', they'll be frettin' with the tear drops in their eyes
They'll be callin' on the Master for a glimpse of Paradise
No one know what will become of all those who shake with fright
Some are gonna be left, some are gonna be right.

If you need to right a wrong, don't wait til winter (don't wait til winter)
If you need to atone, don't wait til winter (don't wait til winter)
The winds of winter blow so cold, no one will have time for you when you're sick

Dost Thou in a manger lie, Who hast all created,
Stretching infant hands on high, Savior, long awaited?
If a monarch, where Thy state? Where Thy court on Thee to wait?
Royal purple where? Here no regal pomp we see;
Naught but need and penury; why thus cradled here?
“Pitying love for fallen man brought Me down thus low…
For a race deep lost in sin, came I into woe…
By this lowly birth of Mine, sinner riches shall be thine,
Matchless gifts and free; willingly this yoke I take,
And this sacrifice I make, heaping joys for thee."
Fervent praise would I to Thee evermore be raising;
For Thy wondrous love to me Thee be ever praising.
Glory, glory be forever unto that most bounteous Giver,
And that loving Lord! Better witness to Thy worth,
Purer praise than ours on earth, angels’ songs afford.

Dost thou truly seek renown
Christ His glory sharing?
Wouldst thou win the heavenly crown
Victor’s meed declaring?
Tread the path the Savior trod,
Look upon the crown of God,
See what He is wearing.
This the King of Heaven bore
In that sore contending;
This His sacred temples wore,
Honor to it lending;
In this helm He faced the foe,
On the rood He laid him low,
Satan’s kingdom ending.
Christ upon the tree of scorn,
In salvation’s hour,
Turned to gold those pricks of thorn
By His Passion’s power;
So on sinners, who had earned
Endless death, from sin returned,
Endless blessings shower.
When in death’s embrace we lie,
Then, good Lord, be near us;
With Thy presence fortify,
And with victory cheer us;
Turn our erring hearts to Thee,
That we crowned for ay may be:
O good Jesu, hear us!

If you see the moon rising gently on your fields
If the wind blows softly on your face
If the sunset lingers while cathedral bells peal
And the moon has risen to her place
You can thank the Father for the things that He has done
And thank Him for the things He's yet to do (if you find a love)
And if you find a love that's tender, if you find someone who's true (thank the 
Lord)
Thank the Lord (thank you Lord), He's been doubly good to you
And if you look in the mirror at the end of a hard day
And you know in your heart you have not lied
And if you gave love freely, if you 'veearned an honest wage
And if you've got Jesus by your side
Thank the Lord, He's been doubly good to you

Well my life’s such a disaster, nothin’ ever turns out right
I’m so stressed with all my problems, can’t get any sleep at night
Everyone I know’s against me and my parents treat me bad
Now you know my whole life story, tell me does it make you sad
Taking every situation in the worst possible way
I can make anything seem bad, I know all the words to say
I exaggerate my stories, make things seem worse than they are
Drag my feet and slump my shoulders, acting sad’s where I’m a star
Look at me everyone down at the bottom of a well
Don’t bother rescuing me yet, I’ve not had time to whine and yell
I could climb out if I wanted, this hole’s not really that deep
At the bottom of the well, though, ‘cause that’s where I want to be
Even when the sun is shinin’ I complain of my sunburn
Sympathy and aloe vera are the things for which I yearn
When my baby wants to snuggle I say “I wanna be alone"
Fun like that just makes me happy, there’s no time to frown and moan
If I’d cast all of my cares upon the Lord as he commands
I know I’d find peace and shelter there inside His loving hands
But I’d not get the attention negativity provides
I’ll just find myself a hole, ask all the watch and jump inside
I need somebody to tell me everything will be alright
Feeling miserable’s hard work, won’t someone pity me tonight?

Down at the cross where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His Name!
Glory to His Name, glory to His Name:
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His Name!
I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where He took me in;
Glory to His Name!
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
Glory to His Name!
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet,
Cast thy poor soul at the Savior’s feet;
Plunge in today, and be made complete;
Glory to His Name!

Down from His splendor in glory He came,
Into a world of woe;
Took on Himself all my guilt and my shame,
Why should He love me so?
How can I help but love Him,
When He loved me so?
How can I help but love Him,
When He loved me so?
I am unworthy to take of His grace,
Wonderful grace so free;
Yes, Jesus suffered and died in my place,
E’en for a soul like me.
He is the fairest of thousands to me,
His love is sweet and true;
Wonderful beauty in Him I now see,
More than I ever knew.

Down from the worlds of radiant light
Behold the Savior come,
To ransom souls from endless night
And bring the wand’rers home.
He calls us to His dear embrace
From mis’ry and despair,
Bids us receive His wondrous grace,
And seek salvation there.
We come, Emmanuel, at Thy call,
Believe Thy glad’ning Word,
Renounce our sins, ourselves, our all,
And glory in our Lord.
Salvation to Messiah’s Name
With grateful hearts we sing,
And join our voices to proclaim
Our Saviour and our King.
Immortal praise to God belongs
For such unfathomed love;
Join, all below, in rapturous songs,
And shout, ye hosts above.

Hushed by the shadows dark and drear,
The feathered songsters rest;
All earth in slumber doth appear,
But Christ, earth’s heav’nly Guest.
Down in the garden hear the mournful sound,
There in the darkness on the dewy ground,
While the watchers they were sleeping,
Was Jesus praying, weeping,
Was Jesus praying, weeping.
With nature’s mantle, night’s dark pall,
Beneath those garden trees,
He wrestled nobly for us all,
From sin, man to release.
Sin’s loathsome weight He bore in sweat,
That oozed in bloody flow;
Ignoble shame was His, and yet
He meekly suffered so.
For sinful mortals, rich and poor,
He fought hell’s legions fierce;
Abased, He won the vict’ry sure,
Though pangs His soul did pierce.

Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,
Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!
Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,
Danger cannot fright me if my Lord is near.
Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Savior would my soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,
Up to where they gather on the hills of God.

Down in the valley ’midst lilies sweet scented,
There is the Friend Whom I love and revere.
Oh, I will follow His steps so contented
As on the breeze His sweet Name I can hear.
O Thou, God’s precious Son,
Who gave Thy life for me,
I am so thankful, Lord, that Thou loved me.
Thee I am seeking, oh, heed my imploring;
Whither in fragrance dost Thou take repose?
Where Thou at midday Thy flock art restoring,
Shaded from heat where the clear fountain flows?
Now I have found Thee, O Jesus, my Savior;
Let me eternally say, Thou art mine.
Hide not Thy face from the soul seeking favor;
Hast Thou not sought me and said I am Thine?
Sweet as Thy voice have the angels ne’er spoken;
Soft as Thy smile can the light never be.
Press me so near to Thy heart in love’s token.
Oh, to be Thine, that means heaven to me.

All joy His loved ones bringing,
When Jesus comes;
All praise through heaven ringing,
When Jesus comes.
All beauty bright and vernal,
When Jesus comes;
All glory, grand, eternal,
When Jesus comes.
Oh, let my lamp be burning
When Jesus comes;
For Him my soul be yearning
When Jesus comes.
No more heart pangs nor sadness,
When Jesus comes;
All peace and joy and gladness,
When Jesus comes.
All doubts and fears will vanish,
When Jesus comes;
All gloom His face will banish,
When Jesus comes.
He’ll know the way was dreary,
When Jesus comes;
He’ll know the feet grew weary,
When Jesus comes.
He’ll know what griefs oppressed me,
When Jesus comes;
Oh, how His arms will rest me!
When Jesus comes.

Down life’s dark vale we wander,
Till Jesus comes;
We watch and wait and wonder,
Till Jesus comes.

I've got a witness not too stable, it wouldn't get me very far
I've got one hand on the table and one in the cookie jar
I've got sins that need eviction from a temple that's a wreck
I've got a chain of contradiction hanging around my neck
So I go down, down, I go down on my knees
I feel the bitter winds grow colder, they are dancing with my pride
I've got a chip on my shoulder bigger than a mountainside
And these claws of human nature hold me tight within their clasp
I'm not worthy of forgiveness but I just had to ask
So I go down, down, I go down on my knees
Feed my hunger - slake my thirst for a spiritual rebirth
Light my darkness, move in me
Make me more than what You see as I go down on my knees
When I've all but killed the fire and my soul's in desperate need
But I wallow in the mire of complacency, that's when I go down on my knees
I want to taste the fruit I'm missing and yet I feast only on the bread
My desire's alive and kicking but my drive is dead
So I go down on my knees
You bear the weight of condemnation cleansing with the blood of truth
So with my humble acclamation, I want to give myself to You
So I go down, I go down, down, down
I go down on my knees
I go down, I go down, I go down on my knees
I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knee.

As I went down in the river to pray, studying about that good old way 
And who shall wear the starry crown, good Lord, show me the way 
Oh sisters let’s go down, let’s go down, come on down 
Oh sisters let’s go down, down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray, studying about that good old way 
And who shall wear the robe and crown, good Lord, show me the way 
Oh brothers let’s go down, let’s go down, come on down 
Come on brothers let’s go down, down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray, studying about that good old way 
And who shall wear the starry crown, good Lord, show me the way 
Oh fathers let’s go down, let’s go down, come on down 
Oh fathers let’s go down, down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray, studying about that good old way 
And who shall wear the robe and crown, good Lord, show me the way 
Oh mothers let’s go down, come on down, don’t you wanna go down 
Come on mothers let’s go down, down in the river to pray
Down in the river to pray, studying about that good old way 
And who shall wear the starry crown, good Lord, show me the way 
Oh sinners let’s go down, let’s go down, come on down 
Oh sinners let’s go down, down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray, studying about that good old way 
And who shall wear the robe and crown, good Lord, show me the way

Down to the sacred wave,
The Lord of life was led;
And He Who came our souls to save
In Jordan bowed His head.
He taught the solemn way;
He fixed the holy rite;
He bade His ransomed ones obey,
And keep the path of light.
Blest Savior, we will tread
In Thy appointed way;
Let glory o’er these scenes be shed
And smile on us today.

A vile, enormous dragon
with heads and horns and crowns
And a tail that swept the stars from heaven
And cruelly cast them down
He lurked before the woman about to bear her Son
The One who'll rule the nations with a rod of iron
Now has come our salvation
The power and the kingdom of God
For the dragon is defeated
By the Word and the blood of the Lamb
Behold, a war in heaven
reflected here on earth
And Michael and his angels
fought for all their worth
That wicked ancient serpent who leads the world astray
The accuser of the brethren was beaten from the fray
Now has come our salvation
The power and the kingdom of God
For the dragon is defeated
By the Word and the blood of the Lamb
By the Word and the blood of the Lamb
Rejoice then, oh ye heavens
But woe to the earth and the sea
For he is filled, filled with fury
He knows his time is brief
'cause he knows his time is brief 
Now has come our salvation
The power and the kingdom of God
For the dragon is defeated
By the Word and the blood of the Lamb
By the Word and the blood of the Lamb

Draw me close to You Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say that I'm Your friend
You are my desire No one else will do
Cause no one else can take Your place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace
Help me find the way Bring me back to You
You're all I want You're all I ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are nea.

I would be nearer, my Savior,
Where I can hear Thy voice
Falling in tenderest whispers,
Making my heart rejoice.
Draw me close to Thee,
Draw me close to Thee;
Keep me, dear Savior, so near Thy side,
Draw me close to Thee.
I would be kept in Thy presence,
Free from the strife of tongues;
There shall the humble adore Thee,
Raising their grateful songs.
Keep me, O Lord, in Thy shadow,
When the dark tempests low’r;
Safely to rest on Thy bosom,
Keep me forevermore.
Swiftly the shadows are deep’ning,
Light of my life, be near;
Strengthen the trust I am keeping,
Fill me with hope and cheer.

Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
Cause nothing else could take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way, bring me back to you

Draw me closer, Lord, to Thee,
Fold me in Thy love’s embrace,
And unto my soul reveal
All the riches of Thy grace.
Draw me closer, closer, closer,
Closer, Lord, to Thee;
Ever purer, purer, purer
Then my soul shall be.
Draw me closer, Lord, to Thee;
In Thy arms Thy child enfold,
And this earthly heart of mine
Into Thine own image mold.
Draw me closer, Lord, to Thee,
In communion rich and sweet,
Till my soul shall be refined,
And in Thee be made complete.
Draw me closer, Lord, to Thee,
For my longing soul aspires
To discover in Thyself
All it yearns for and desires.

Draw me into Your presence
Draw me into Your presence
Draw me into Your presence;
I want to know You.
For there's life in Your presence
There is life in Your presence
There is life in Your presence;
I want to know You.

Where else could I go?
Where else could I hide?
For only in Your presence, Lord,
Can I find peace of mind.

I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to Thee.
Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died.
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.
Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.
O the pure delight of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God
I commune as friend with friend!
There are depths of love that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.

Draw nigh and take the body of the Lord;
And drink the holy blood for you outpoured.
Saved by that body and that holy blood,
With souls refreshed, we render thanks to God.
Salvation’s Giver, Christ, the only Son,
By His dear cross and blood the victory won.
Offered was He for greatest and for least,
Himself the Victim, and Himself the Priest.
Victims were offered by the law of old,
Which in a type this heavenly mystery told.
He, Ransomer from death, and Light from shade,
Now gives His holy grace His saints to aid.
Approach ye then with faithful hearts sincere,
And take the safeguard of salvation here.
He, that His saints in this world rules and shields,
To all believers life eternal yields.
With heavenly bread makes them that hunger whole,
Gives living waters to the thirsting soul,
Alpha and Omega, to Whom shall bow
All nations at the doom, is with us now.

Draw nigh to Thy Jerusalem, O Lord,
Thy faithful people cry with one accord;
Ride on in triumph; Lord, behold we lay
Our passions, lusts, and proud wills in Thy way!
Thy road is ready; and Thy paths made straight,
With longing expectation seem to wait
The consecration of Thy beauteous feet,
And silently Thy promised advent greet!
Hosanna! welcome to our hearts! for here
Thou hast a temple, too, as Zion dear;
O enter in, dear Lord, unbar the door;
And in that temple dwell forevermore.

Draw Thou my soul, O Christ, closer to Thine;
Breathe into every wish Thy will divine;
Raised my low self above, won by Thy deathless love,
Ever, O Christ, through mine let Thy life shine.
Lead forth my soul, O Christ, one with Thine own,
Joyful to follow Thee through paths unknown;
In Thee my strength renew; give me Thy work to do;
Through me Thy truth be shown, Thy love made known.
Not for myself alone may my prayer be;
Lift Thou Thy world, O Christ, closer to Thee;
Cleanse it from guilt and wrong; teach it salvation’s song
Till earth, as heaven, fulfills God’s holy will.

Drawn to the cross, which Thou has blest
With healing gifts for souls distressed,
To find in Thee my life, my rest,
Christ Crucified, I come.
Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,
Thy grace abused, my misspent years;
Yet now to Thee with contrite tears,
Christ Crucified, I come.
Wash me and take away each stain;
Let nothing of my sin remain.
For cleansing, tho’ it be thro’ pain,
Christ Crucified, I come.
And then for work to do for Thee,
Which shall so sweet a service be
That angels well might envy me,
Christ Crucified, I come.

Dread Jehovah, God of nations,
From Thy temple in the skies,
Hear Thy people’s supplications,
Now for their deliverance rise.
Lo, with deep contritions turning,
Humbly at Thy feet we bend;
Hear us, fasting, praying, mourning;
Hear us, spare us, and defend.
Though our sins, our hearts confounding,
Long and loud for vengeance call,
Thou hast mercy more abounding,
Jesus’ blood can cleanse from all.
Let that love veil our transgressions,
Let that blood our guilt efface:
Save Thy people from oppression,
Save from spoil Thy holy place.

Drifting away from Jesus,
Far from His gentle fold,
Wrecked on the waves of sorrow,
Out in the night so cold.
1-3:
Oh, am I lost forever?
Lost amid fiendish din?
Oh, can there be no lifeboat
On the dark ocean of sin? 
Drifting away from Jesus,
Day after day I glide,
Swiftly the billows bear me
Over the surging tide.
Drifting away from Jesus,
Helpless, and tossed with care;
Soon I shall land forever
Somewhere, I know not where.
Drifting away from Jesus,
Far from His courts of love,
Oh, do you see! A lifeboat
Sails from the ports above!
Over the bounding billows,
Jesus, my Savior, sends
Help to my storm-tossed spirit;
Praise to the Friend of friends! 

Out on the perilous deep
Where danger silently creeps
And storm so violently sweeping
You're drifting too far from the shore
Drifting too far from the shore
You're drifting too far from the shore
Come to Jesus today let him show you the way
You're drifting too far from the shore
Today the tempest rose high
And clouds o'ershadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting too far from the shore
Drifting too far from the shore
You're drifting too far from the shore
Come to Jesus today let him show you the way
You're drifting too far from the shore
Why meet a terrible fate
Mercies abundantly wait
Turn back before its too late
You're drifting too far from the shore
Drifting too far from the shore
You're drifting too far from the shore
Come to Jesus today let him show you the way
You're drifting too far from the shore

Drop drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket (x
Hearts beatin' a mile a minute but it's not from exercise
Livin' in a pressure cooker, a calm demeanor's no disguise
Got your nose in your checkbook, your measurement of earthly wealth
Why you worrying about tomorrow? Let tomorrow worry 'bout itself (don't you, 
don't you worry) 
It's just a drop.Oh, it's just a drop in the bucket 
I see you working on a treadmill, running, staying in the same place
Not sure what you're running for, have you thought that maybe you're in the 
wrong race?
Running late, prime lending rate.Don't you think enough is enough? (that's 
enough)
Life is much too precious.Don't waste your time sweatin' the small stuff (drop, 
just a drop, just a drop) 
It's just a drop in the bucket (it's just a drop in the bucket), can't you see 
the forest for the trees
Just a drop in the bucket (it's just a drop in the bucket) when you compare 
eternity 
Knew a man named Johnny, trying hard to break a bent bow
He knows just where He's going, keeping all his ducks in a row
He says he couldn't be happier, but what about the price he paid?
Last time I saw Johnny he looked a bit old for his age 
(Drop drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket (x(in background))
(It's just a drop in the bucket) Can't see the forest for the trees
(It's just a drop in the bucket) The view is much better on bended knee
(It's just a drop in the bucket) Life is much more than what you see
(It's just a drop in the bucket) When you compare eternity 
Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness
And all these things you need He'll give to you
His yoke is easy and His burden is light
So let it go 'cause He knows what to do 
If your life is looking stretched out your glasses probably need a new lens
The center gets a little hot when you try to burn the candle at both ends
So why you running up a stress test? It's either black or it's white
Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? 
It's just a drop in the bucket (Drop drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket) (Drop 
drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket)
It's just a drop in the bucket (Drop drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket) (Drop

drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket) 
It's just a drop in the bucket (Drop drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket) (Drop 
drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket)
Just a little bitty drop, just a little, just a little bitty drop
It's just a drop in the bucket (Drop drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket) (Drop

Just a little drop, drip, drop, drip, drop, drip, just a little bitty drop

Only a small drop in the bucket
It's just a drop in the bucket (Drop drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket) (Drop 
drop drop drop, Drop in the Bucket) 

Drop, drop, slow tears,
And bathe those beauteous feet,
Which brought from Heav’n
The news and Prince of Peace.
Cease not, wet tears,
His mercies to entreat;
To cry for vengeance:
Sin doth never cease.
In your deep floods
Drown all my faults and fears;
Nor let His eye see
Sin, but through my tears.

Dusky hands are reaching for the bread of life
Far across the rolling sea;
Shall they perish in their misery and strife,
Shall they always hungry be?
Send the Gospel tidings over land and sea,
Let the hungry souls be satisfied,
Till the pow’r of Jesus sets the captives free,
O lead them to the Master’s side.
Dusky hands are bound in chains of want and woe
In the far off heathen lands;
Shall we not in haste unto their borders go,
Set them free, as God commands?
We cannot be idle any longer now,
While the souls in darkness die;
Gather them as jewels for the Savior’s brow,
While the days are passing by.
Dusky faces look to us for hope and peace,
Shall they look to us in vain?
Jesus can redeem them, cause their sighs to cease,
Rend their chains of sin in twain.

Oh oh oh oh
Hey yeah yeah
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh oh oh 
I close my eyes, only for a moment and the moment’s gone 
All my dreams (all my dreams)
Pass before my eyes (pass before my eyes)
A curiosity (that we are)
Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind (all we are is dust)
It’s the same old song (same old song)
Just a drop of water in an endless sea (drip, drop, same old song)
All we do (all we do) crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see (crumbles 
down)
That we are dust…dust in the wind (dust in the wind)
All we are is dust in the wind (all we are is dust)
All we are (dust in the wind) dust in the wind (all we are is dust, dust in the 
wind)
Rap:
Need to wake up
Surprise, the lies, deceive my eyes
And even now another baby in a barren land cries,
Are we too thick to realize?
That nobody ever knows when you could vaporize
Still we sit and fantasize
The TV and the radio demoralize
We need to look up to the skies 
Don’t allow the very hearts of man to crystallize (all we are is dust)
Turn off that big screen TV
Stop trying to take it easy 
Get off your couch, open up your mouth (oh my Lord)
And spread the word universally
So don’t hang on (don’t you hang on)
Nothing lasts forever, not the earth or sky (nothin’ lasts forever)
It’s all gonna slip away (slips away)
And not even your money (your money) another minute buy (time keeps on tick tock 
tickin’)
Dust in the wind (all we are is dust)
All they are is dust (all we are is dust)
Dust in the wind, ohhhhhhh (all we are is dust)
Dust in the wind
We need to end our fussing and fighting
To take some time for reuniting
All we are is dust 
All we are is dust, dust in the wind

There's dust on mother's Bible
Its cover's worn with age
And tho it's old and wrinkled
Mama's there on every page
The night the angels called her
Mama called me to her side
And handed me her Bible
Said "Son, let God be your guide."
I picked up mother's old Bible
To my heart I pressed it tight
And I heard her softly whisper
"Son, I'll meet you on the other side."
I kissed my mother's old Bible
And I wiped away the dust.
Oh you never know until she's gone
How you'll miss your mother's love

Dust on the Bible, dust on the holy word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord .
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the Bible and re-deem your poor soul.
I went into a home one day to see some friends of mine
Of all the books and magazines, not a Bible could I find .
I asked them for the Bible; when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a finger-[D7]print was plain.
You can read your magazines, read of love and tragic things 
And not one verse of scripture, not one verse do you know .
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
Dust on the Bible will doom your soul.
EXTRA VERSE:
Oh, if you have a friend you'd like to help along life's way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray .
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible, trade the wrong way for the right.

Dust to dust, the mortal dies,
Both the foolish and the wise;
None forever can remain,
Each must leave his hoarded gain.
Yet within their heart they say
That their houses are for aye,
That their dwelling places grand
Shall for generations stand.
To their lands they give their name
In the hope of lasting fame,
But man’s honor quickly flies,
Like the lowly beast he dies.
Though such folly mark their way,
Men approve of what they say;
Death their shepherd, they the sheep,
He within his fold will keep.
O’er them soon shall rule the just,
All their beauty turn to dust;
God my waiting soul shall save,
He will raise me from the grave.
Let no fear disturb your peace
Though one’s house and wealth increase;
Death shall end his fleeting day,
He shall carry naught away.
Though in life he wealth attained,
Though the praise of men he gained,
He shall join those gone before,
Where the light shall shine no more.
Crowned with honor though he be,
Highly gifted, strong and free,
If he be not truly wise,
Man is like the beast that dies.

Dwell in the midst of us
Come and dwell in this place
Dwell in the midst of us
Come and have your way
Dwell in the midst of us
Wipe all the tears from our faces
Dwell in the midst of us
You can have your way
Not our will, but yours be done
Come and change us
Not our will, but yours be done
Come sustain us

Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling.
Then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand.
Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling.
None of these shall move me from Beulah Land.
I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky.
I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry.
O yes! I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating.
Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand.
Safe am I within the castle of God’s Word retreating.
Nothing then can reach me—’tis Beulah Land.
Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me;
I am safely sheltered here, protected by God’s hand.
Here the sun is always shining, here there’s naught can harm me.
I am safe forever in Beulah Land.
Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation.
Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way He planned.
Dwelling in the Spirit here I learn of full salvation.
Gladly I will tarry in Beulah Land.

Long lone years I lived in sin,
Wretched slave I was within;
Goshen was my dwelling place,
Dark and deep was my disgrace.
But now I’m 
Dwelling in the land,
Fed from Father’s hand,
Trusting, simply trusting every day;
Living in the light,
Blest with beauty bright,
Walking with my Savior all the way.
I will sing unto the Lord:
By the power of His word
Pharoah’s hosts are in the sea,
Parted by His pow’r for me.
And now I’m 
Wand’ring through the wilderness,
Oft I stumbled in distress;
Yet by cloud and fiery flame,
Led o’er shimm’ring sands I came.
And now I’m 
I to Jordan’s banks was brought,
Saw the shore I longing sought:
God in answer to my plea
Second parting made for me.
So now I’m 
Jericho and giants fell,
Death to all that would rebel;
In this land I’ll ever dwell,
And my God’s great goodness tell.
Praise God, I’m 

Lovely are Your dwelling pla - ces.
Thirsty, I come after You.
Jesus, my joy, my reward,
Your love's restoring my soul.
Now I'm Yours, and You are mine.
And from my heart a song will rise.
I love You, I love You, I love You.
I love You, I love You, I love You.
I love You, I love You, I love You.
And my heart will follow wholly after You.
Jesus, there is none beside You
Righteous, ruler of the earth,
Nations will come and bow down.
Name over all names, I sing You prai - ses,
And all that I can say to You is

Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
Living with Jesus, a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment, I’m under His care.
Never a heartache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan;
Never a danger but there on the throne,
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus my Savior, abides with me still.

The dawn is sprinkling in the east
Its golden shower, as day flows in;
Fast mount the pointed shafts of light:
Farewell to darkness and to sin!
Away, ye midnight phantoms all!
Away, despondence and despair!
Whatever guilt the night has brought
Now let it vanish into air.
So, Lord, when that last morning breaks,
Looking to which we sigh and pray,
O may it to Thy minstrels prove
The dawning of a better day.
To God the Father glory be,
And to His sole begotten Son;
Glory, O Holy Ghost, to Thee
While everlasting ages run.

The dawn of God’s dear Sabbath
Breaks o’er the earth again,
As some sweet summer morning
After a night of pain;
It comes as cooling showers
To some exhausted land,
As shade of clustered palm trees
’Mid weary wastes of sand.
Lord, we would bring for offering
Though marred with earthly soil,
Our week of earnest labor,
Of useful daily toil;
Fair fruits of self denial,
Of strong, deep love to Thee,
Fostered by Thine own Spirit
In our humility.
And, we would bring our burden
Of sinful thought and deed,
In Thy pure presence kneeling,
From bondage to be freed;
Our heart’s most bitter sorrow
For all Thy work undone;
So many talents wasted!
So few bright laurels won!
And with that sorrow mingling,
A steadfast faith, and sure,
And love so deep and fervent,
That tries to make it pure;
In His dear presence finding
The pardon that we need;
And then the peace so lasting,
Celestial peace indeed!
So be it, Lord, forever;
O may we evermore
In Jesus’ holy presence
His blessed Name adore,
Upon His peaceful Sabbath,
Within His temple walls—
Type of the stainless worship
In Zion’s golden halls.

The day draws on with golden light,
Glad songs go echoing through the height,
The broad earth lifts an answering cheer,
The deep makes moan with wailing fear.
For lo, He comes, the mighty King,
To take from death his power and sting,
To trample down his gloomy reign
And break the weary prisoner’s chain.
Enclosed He lay in rocky cell,
With guard of armed sentinel;
But thence returning, strong and free,
He comes with pomp of jubilee.
The sad Apostles mourn Him slain,
Nor hope to see their Lord again;
Their Lord, Whom rebel thralls defy,
Arraign, accuse, and doom to die.
But now they put their grief away,
The pains of hell are loosed today;
For by the grave, with flashing eyes,
“Your Lord is risen," the angel cries.
Maker of all, to Thee we pray,
Fulfill in us Thy joy today;
When death assails, grant, Lord, that we
May share Thy Paschal victory.
To Thee Who, dead, again, dost live,
All glory, Lord, Thy people give;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.

The day is fast approaching when the Savior shall appear,
And every eye His glory shall behold;
The tokens of His coming fill the loyal heart with cheer
Though strife abounds and love is waxing cold.
We’ll see Him as He is,
And the brightness of His glory we shall share;
We’ll see Him as He is,
And the likeness of His image we shall bear.
In all His Father’s glory, clothed in majesty unveiled,
With myriads of the shining angel band,
The King descends triumphant in Whose might we have prevailed,
And all the ransomed rise at His command.
Oh, may we all as sons of light be watching unto prayer,
For surely our redemption draweth nigh;
With holy zeal and patient faith, let every soul prepare
To join the advent in the sky.

The day is gently sinking to a close,
Fainter and yet more faint the sunlight glows:
O Brightness of Thy Father’s glory,
Thou eternal Light of light, be with us now:
Where Thou art present darkness cannot be;
Midnight is glorious noon, O Lord, with Thee.
Our changeful lives are ebbing to an end;
Onward to darkness and to death we tend;
O Conqueror of the grave, be Thou our Guide;
Be Thou our Light in death’s dark eventide;
Then in our mortal hour will be no gloom,
No sting in death, no terror in the tomb.
Thou, Who in darkness walking didst appear
Upon the waves, and Thy disciples cheer,
Come, Lord, in lonesome days, when storms assail,
And earthly hopes and human succors fail;
When all is dark, may we behold Thee nigh,
And hear Thy voice, “Fear not, for it is I."
The weary world is moldering to decay,
Its glories wane, its pageants fade away:
In that last sunset, when the stars shall fall,
May we arise, awakened by Thy call,
With Thee, O Lord, forever to abide,
In that blest day which has no eventide.

The day is past and gone,
The evening shades appear;
O may we all remember well
The night of death draws near.
We lay our garments by,
Upon our beds to rest;
So death shall soon disrobe us all
Of what is here possessed.
Lord, keep us safe this night,
Secure from all our fears;
May angels guard us while we sleep,
Till morning light appears.

The day is past and over;
All thanks, O Lord, to Thee!
We pray Thee that offenseless
The hours of dark may be.
O Jesus, keep us in Thy sight,
And guard us through the coming night.
The joys of day are over;
We lift our hearts to Thee,
And call on Thee that sinless
The hours of dark may be.
O Jesus, make their darkness light,
And guard us through the coming night.
Lord, that in death I sleep not,
And lest my foe should say,
“I have prevailed against him,"
Lighten mine eyes, I pray:
O Jesus, keep me in Thy sight,
And guard me through the coming night.
The toils of day are over;
We raise our hymn to Thee,
And ask that free from peril
The hours of dark may be.
O Jesus, keep us in Thy sight,
And guard us through the coming night.
Be Thou our souls’ Preserver,
O God, for Thou dost know
How many are the perils
Through which we have to go.
Lord Jesus Christ, O hear our call
And guard and save us from them all.

The day is slowly wending
Toward its silent ending,
But mid the light declining
The evening star is shining:
O Father, while we sleep,
Thy children keep!
Beneath Thy mighty caring
The birds and beasts are sharing,
The love that sends the showers,
The hand that gives the flowers:
Though long our day of testing,
Now comes the hour of resting,
May weariness and sadness
Be lulled to peace and gladness:
The Savior’s cross is winning
Forgiveness for the sinning,
And while we kneel confessing,
We humbly wait Thy blessing:
All evil thoughts expelling,
Now make in us Thy dwelling,
O Spirit, pure and holy,
Possess these hearts so lowly:

The day is surely drawing near,
When God’s Son, the Anointed,
Shall with great majesty appear,
As Judge of all appointed.
All mirth and laughter then shall cease
When flames on flames will still increase,
As Scripture truly teacheth.
A trumpet loud shall then resound,
And all the earth be shaken;
Then all who in their graves are found
Shall from their sleep awaken.
But all that live shall in that hour,
By the Almighty’s boundless power
Be changed at His commanding.
A book is opened then to all,
A record truly telling
What each hath done, both great and small,
When he on earth was dwelling;
And every heart be clearly seen,
And all be known as they have been,
In thoughts and words and actions.
Then woe to those who scorned the Lord,
And sought but carnal pleasures,
Who here despised His precious Word,
And loved their earthly treasures!
With shame and trembling they will stand,
And at the Judge’s stern command
To Satan be delivered.
O Jesus, Who my debt didst pay
And for my sin wast smitten
Within the Book of Life, oh, may
My name be also written!
I will not doubt; I trust in Thee,
From Satan Thou hast made me free
And from all condemnation.
Therefore, my Intercessor be,
And for Thy blood and merit
Declare my name from judgment free,
With all who life inherit;
That I may see Thee face to face
With all thy saints in that blest place
Which Thou for us hast purchased.
O Jesus Christ, do not delay,
O hasten our salvation!
We often tremble on our way
In fear and tribulation.
Then hear us when we cry to Thee;
Come, mighty Judge, and make us free
From every evil.

Time with its tempests is passing away,
Some day, and soon it may be,
Jesus will come, oh, that glorious day!
Coming in glory for me.
The day of all days is coming at last,
The day of all days when sorrows are past,
The day of all days when I thro’ His grace
Shall see with delight His wonderful face.
Oh, what a wonderful joy to be there,
Praising the Lamb that was slain;
Rising to met Him, caught up in the air!
Oh, He is coming again.
That is the wonderful day of all days,
That day when time shall be o’er;
Tongues of all nations will sing of His praise
On fair eternity’s shore.

The day of resurrection! Earth, tell it out abroad;
The Passover of gladness, the Passover of God.
From death to life eternal, from earth unto the sky,
Our Christ hath brought us over, with hymns of victory.
Our hearts be pure from evil, that we may see aright
The Lord in rays eternal of resurrection light;
And listening to His accents, may hear, so calm and plain,
His own “All hail!" and, hearing, may raise the victor strain.
Now let the heavens be joyful! Let earth the song begin!
Let the round world keep triumph, and all that is therein!
Let all things seen and unseen their notes in gladness blend,
For Christ the Lord hath risen, our joy that hath no end.

The day of the Lord is at hand, at hand;
Its storms roll up the sky;
The nations sleep starving on heaps of gold;
All dreamers toss and sigh;
The night is darkest before the morn;
When the pain is sorest the child is born,
And the day of the Lord is at hand, at hand,
The day of the Lord is at hand.
Who would sit down and sigh for a lost age of gold,
While the Lord of all ages is here?
True hearts will leap at the trumpet of God,
And those who can suffer can dare.
Each old age of gold was an iron age, too,
And the meekest of saints may find stern work to do
In the day of the Lord at hand, at hand,
In the day of the Lord at hand.

That day of wrath, that dreadful day,
[or, The day of wrath…]
When Heav’n and earth shall pass away!
What pow’r shall be the sinner’s stay?
How shall he meet that dreadful day?
When, shriveling like a parched scroll,
The flaming heav’ns together roll;
When louder yet, and yet more dread;
Swells the high trump that wakes the dead.
O on that day, that wrathful day
When man to judgment wakes from clay,
Be Thou the trembling sinner’s stay,
Though Heav’n and earth shall pass away.

The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended,
The darkness falls at Thy behest;
To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.
We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping,
While earth rolls onward into light,
Through all the world her watch is keeping,
And rests not now by day or night.
As o’er each continent and island
The dawn leads on another day,
The voice of prayer is never silent,
Nor dies the strain of praise away.
The sun that bids us rest is waking
Our brethren ’neath the western sky,
And hour by hour fresh lips are making
Thy wondrous doings heard on high.
So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
Like earth’s proud empires, pass away:
Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever,
Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.

The day, O Lord, is spent;
Abide with us, and rest;
Our hearts’ desires are fully bent
On making Thee our Guest.
We have not reached that land,
That happy land, as yet,
Where holy angels round Thee stand,
Whose sun can never set.
Our sun is sinking now;
Our day is almost o’er;
O Sun of Righteousness, do Thou
Shine on us evermore.
From men below the skies,
And all the heavenly host,
To God the Father praise arise,
The Son, and Holy Ghost.

The death of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
We celebrate with one accord;
It is our comfort in distress,
Our heart’s sweet joy and happiness.
He blotted out with His own blood
The judgment that against us stood;
He full atonement for us made,
And all our debt He fully paid.
That this is now and ever true
He gives an earnest ever new:
In this His holy supper here
We taste His love so sweet, so near.
His Word proclaims, and we believe,
That in the supper we receive
His very body, as He said,
His very blood for sinners shed.
A precious food is this indeed—
It never fails us in our need—
A heavenly manna for our soul.
Until we safely reach our goal.
Oh, blest is each believing guest
Who in this promise finds his rest;
For Jesus will in love abide
With those who do in Him confide.
The guest that comes with true intent
To turn to God and to repent,
To live for Christ, to die to sin,
Will thus a holy life begin.
They who His Word do not believe
This food unworthily receive,
Salvation here will never find—
May we this warning keep in mind!
Help us sincerely to believe
That we may worthily receive
Thy supper and in Thee find rest.
Amen, he who believes is blest.

The duteous day now closeth,
Each flower and tree reposeth,
Shade creeps o’er wild and wood:
Let us, as night is falling,
On God our Maker calling,
Give thanks to Him, the Giver good.
Now all the heav’nly splendor
Breaks forth in starlight tender
From myriad worlds unknown;
And man, the marvel seeing,
Forgets his selfish being,
For joy of beauty not his own.
Awhile his mortal blindness
May miss God’s lovingkindness,
And grope in faithless strife:
But when life’s day is over
Shall death’s fair night discover
The fields of everlasting life.

The dying robber raised his aching brow
To claim the dying Lord for company;
And heard, in answer to his trembling bow,
The promise of the King: Thou—even thou—
Today shalt be in Paradise with me.
We, too, the measure of our guilt confess,
Knowing Thy mercy, Lord, our only plea;
That we, like him, through judgment and distress,
For all the weight of our unworthiness
May win our way to Paradise with Thee.
But so bewildered is our failing heart,
So dim the luster of Thy royalty,
We hardly know Thee, Lord, for what Thou art,
Till we begin to take the better part
And lose ourselves in Paradise with Thee.
Then lift our eyes, dear Lord, from this poor dross,
To see Thee reigning in humility,
The King of love; that, wresting gain from loss,
We, too, may climb the ladder of the cross,
To find our home in Paradise with Thee.

An endless line of splendor,
These troops with Heav’n for home,
With creeds they go from Scotland,
With incense go from Rome.
These, in the Name of Jesus,
Against the dark gods stand,
They gird the earth with valor,
They heed their King’s command.
Onward the line advances,
Shaking the hills with power,
Slaying the hidden demons,
The lions that devour.
No bloodshed in the wrestling—
But souls new born arise—
The nations growing kinder,
The child-hearts growing wise.
What is the final ending?
The issue, can we know?
Will Christ outlive Mohammed?
Will Kali’s altar go?
This is our faith tremendous—
Our wild hope, who shall scorn—
That in the Name of Jesus
The world shall be reborn.

If I have wounded any soul today,
If I have caused one foot to go astray,
If I have walked in my own willful way,
Dear Lord, forgive!
If I have uttered idle words or vain,
If I have turned aside from want or pain,
Lest I myself shall suffer through the strain,
Dear Lord, forgive!
If I have been perverse or hard, or cold,
If I have longed for shelter in Thy fold,
When Thou hast given me some fort to hold,
Dear Lord, forgive!
Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee;
Forgive the secret sins I do not see;
O guide me, love me and my keeper be,
Dear Lord, Amen.

An exile for the faith,
Of His incarnate Lord,
Beyond the stars, beyond all space,
His soul in vision soared.
There saw in glory Him
Who liveth, and was dead,
There Judah’s Lion, and the Lamb
That for our ransom bled.
There of the Kingdom learned
The mysteries sublime;
How, sown in martyrs’ blood, the faith
Should spread from clime to clime.
Lord, give us grace, like him,
In Thee to live and die;
To spurn the fleeting things of earth,
And seek for joys on high.
Jesu, our risen Lord,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with God the Father One
And Spirit evermore.

Each cooing dove and sighing bough,
That makes the eve so blessed to me,
Has something far diviner now,
It bears me back to Galilee.
O Galilee, sweet Galilee,
Where Jesus loved so much to be,
O Galilee, blue Galilee,
Come sing thy song again to me.
Each flowery glen and mossy dell,
Where happy birds in song agree,
Through sunny morn the praises tell
Of sights and sounds in Galilee.
And when I read the thrilling lore
Of Him Who walked upon the sea,
I long, oh, how I long once more
To follow Him in Galilee.

Each day I'll do a golden deed,
By helping those who are in need,
My life on earth is but a span,
And so I'll do the best I can,
The best I can.
Life's evening sun is sinking low,
A few more days and I must go
To meet the deeds that I have done,
Where there will be no setting sun.
To be a child of God each day,
My light must shine along the way;
I'll sing His praise while ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul,
Some troubled soul.
The only life that will endure,
Is one that's kind and good and pure;
And so for God I'll take my stand,
Each day I'll lend a helping hand,
A helping hand.
I'll help someone in time of need,
And journey on with rapid speed;
I'll help the sick and poor and weak,
And words of kindness to them speak,
Kind words I'll speak.
While going down life's weary road,
I'll try to lift some traveler's load;
I'll try to turn the night to day,
Make flowers bloom along the way,
The lonely way.

Words and Music by John Peterson
Darling, the day has come that we've been dreaming of,
When at the altar white we'll say our vows of love;
Oh, what a happy time: all gone the doubt and fear,
And, with the promises, we'll add this one my Dear.
Each for the other and both for the Lord.
Oh, Darling Sweetheart, let the angels record;
Vows sweetly spoken; may they never be broken;
Each for the other, and both for the Lord.
We'll walk together Love, thru sunshine - thru the shade,
We'll mingle tears and smiles and travel unafraid;
Halos of happiness will crown each passing day
Til heaven shines ahead and beckons us away.
Each for the other and both for the Lord.
Oh, Darling Sweetheart, let the angels record;
Vows sweetly spoken; may they never be broken;
Each for the other, and both for the Lord.

Each step I take my Saviour goes before me,
And with His loving hand He leads the way,
And with each breath I whisper "I adore Thee;"
Oh, what joy to walk with Him each day.
Ref:
Each step I take I know that He will guide me;
To higher ground He ever leads me on.
Until some day the last step will be taken.
Each step I take just leads me closer home.
At times I feel my faith begin to waver,
When up ahead I see a chasm wide.
It's then I turn and look up to my Saviour,
I am strong when He is by my side.
I trust in God, no matter come what may,
For life eternal in His hand,
He holds the key that opens up the way,
That will lead me to the promised land.

Here I am waiting
Abide in me I pray
Here I am longing for you
Hide me in your love
Bring me to my knees
May I know Jesus more and more
Come live in me
All my life
Take over
Come breathe in me
And I will rise
On eagle's wings

Early, my God, without delay,
I haste to seek Thy face;
My thirsty spirit faints away
Without Thy cheering grace.
So pilgrims on the scorching sand,
Beneath a burning sky,
Long for a cooling stream at hand,
And they must drink or die.
I’ve seen Thy glory and Thy power
Through all Thy temple shine;
My God, That vision so divine.
Not all the blessings of a feast
Can please my soul so well,
As when Thy richer grace I taste,
And in Thy presence dwell.
Not life itself, with all her joys,
Can my best passions move,
Or raise so high my cheerful voice,
As Thy forgiving love.
Thus till my last expiring day
I’ll bless my God and King;
Thus will I lift my hands to pray,
And tune my lips to sing.

Earth has many a noble city;
Bethlehem, thou dost all excel;
Out of thee the Lord from Heaven
Came to rule His Israel.
Fairer than the sun at morning
Was the star that told His birth,
To the world its God announcing
Seen in fleshly form on earth.
Eastern sages at His cradle
Make oblations rich and rare;
See them give, in deep devotion,
Gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Sacred gifts of mystic meaning:
Incense doth their God disclose,
Gold the King of kings proclaimeth,
Myrrh His sepulcher foreshows.
Jesu, whom the Gentiles worshipped
At Thy glad Epiphany,
Unto Thee, with God the Father
And the Spirit, glory be.

Earth was waiting, spent and restless,
with a mingled hope and fear,
faithful men and women praying,
"Surely, Lord, the day is near:
the Desire of all the nations--
it is time he should appear!"
Then the Spirit of the Highest
to a Virgin meek came down,
and he burdened her with blessing,
and he pained her with renown;
for she bore the Lord's Anointed
for his cross and for his crown.
Earth has groaned and labored for him
since the ages first began,
for in him was hid the secret
which through all the ages ran--
Son of Mary, Son of David,
Son of God, and Son of Man.

Earth, with all thy thousand voices,
Praise in songs th’eternal King;
Praise His Name, Whose praise rejoices
Ears that hear, and tongues that sing.
Lord, from each far-peopled dwelling,
Earth shall raise the glad acclaim;
All shall kneel, Thy greatness telling,
Sing Thy praise and bless Thy Name.
Come and hear the wondrous story,
How our mighty God of old,
In the terrors of His glory,
Back the flowing billows rolled;
Walked within the threatening waters,
Free we passed the upright wave,
Then was joy to Israel’s daughters,
Loud they sang His power to save.
Bless the Lord, Who ever liveth;
Sound His praise through every land,
Who our dying souls reviveth,
By Whose arm upheld we stand.
Now upon this cheerful morrow
We Thine altars will adorn,
And the gifts we vowed in sorrow
Pay on joy’s returning morn.
Come, each faithful soul, who fearest,
Him Who fills th’eternal throne:
Hear, rejoicing while thou hearest,
What our God for us hath done;
When we made our supplication,
When our voice in prayer was strong,
Then we found His glad salvation;
And His mercy fills our tongue.

Earth, rejoice, our Lord is King!
Sons of men, his praises sing;
Sing ye in triumphant strains,
Jesus the Messiah reigns!
Power is all to Jesus given,
Lord of hell, and earth, and heaven,
Every knee to him shall bow;
Satan, hear, and tremble now!
Angels and archangels join,
All triumphantly combine,
All in Jesu's praise agree,
Carrying on his victory.
Though the sons of night blaspheme,
More there are with us than them;
God with us, we cannot fear;
Fear, ye fiends, for Christ is hear!
Lo, to faith's enlightened sight,
All the mountain flames with light!
Hell is nigh, but God is nigher,
Circling us with hosts of fire.
Christ the Saviour is come down,
Points us to the victor's crown,
Bids us take our seats above,
More than conquerors in his love.

Earthly pleasures vainly call me;
I would be like Jesus;
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;
I would be like Jesus.
Be like Jesus, this my song,
In the home and in the throng;
Be like Jesus, all day long!
I would be like Jesus.
He has broken every fetter,
I would be like Jesus;
That my soul may serve Him better,
I would be like Jesus.
All the way from earth to glory,
I would be like Jesus;
Telling over and over the story,
I would be like Jesus.
That in heaven He may meet me,
I would be like Jesus;
That His words “Well done" may greet me,
I would be like Jesus.

Raised from the sea the solid land,
And drove each billowy heap away,
And bade the earth stand firm for aye:
That so, with flowers of golden hue,
The seeds of each it might renew;
And fruit trees bearing fruit might yield—
And pleasant pasture of the field;
Our spirit’s rankling wounds efface
With dewy freshness of Thy grace:
That grief may cleanse each deed of ill,
And o’er each lust may triumph still.
Let every soul Thy law obey,
And keep from every evil way;
Rejoice each promised good to win
And flee from every mortal sin.
O Father, that we ask be done,
Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.

As far as the worst is from the best

I'm unworthy (I'm unworthy, Lord)
He is faithful (You are faithful, Lord)

And oh how far He's taken

As far as the dying from the birth
As far as the darkness from the light
As far as the blindness from the sight

O the Easter bells are gladly ringing,
Let the whole world join the happy lay,
Let the hills and vales break forth in singing,
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris'n today.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Let the whole world join the happy lay,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris'n today.
O the Easter bells are gladly ringing,
Hear the shouts along the King's highway;
Songs of praise the children, too, are singing,
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris'n today.
O the Easter bells are gladly ringing,
For the night of death has passed away,
Lo! the gates of morn are open swinging,
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris'n today.

Lift up, O little children,
Your voices clear and sweet,
And sing the blessed story
Of Christ, the Lord of glory,
And worship at His feet,
And worship at His feet.
Oh, sing the blessed story!
The Lord of life and glory
Is risen, as He said,
Is risen from the dead!
Lift up, O tender lilies,
Your whiteness to the sun;
The earth is not our prison,
Since Christ Himself hath risen,
The life of ev’ry one,
The life of ev’ry one.
Ring, all ye bells of Easter,
Your chimes of joy again,
Ring out the night of sadness
Ring in the morn of gladness,
For death no more shall reign,
For death no more shall reign.

Easter flowers are blooming bright,
Easter skies pour radiant light,
Christ our Lord is risen in might,
Glory in the highest!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Christ our Lord is risen in might,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Angels caroled this sweet lay,
When in manger rude He lay,
Now once more cast grief away,
Glory in the highest!
He, then born to grief and pain,
Now to glory born again,
Calleth forth our gladdest strain,
Glory in the highest!
As He riseth, rise we too,
Tune we heart and voice anew,
Offering homage glad and true,
Glory in the highest!

Easter, joyous Easter, holy happy time!
Bells ring out their message, joy in every chime;
Sweetly through their music, faint an echo swells,
Voices seem to mingle with the bells.(Glad Easter bells.)
Seek ye not the living here among the dead;
Christ the Lord is risen, risen as He said;
Blessed reassurance, gone the weary night,
Christ is risen! Easter breaks in floods of light!
Voices in a garden, near a rock-hewn tomb,
Gracious heav’nly voices, cheering earth’s dark gloom;
Voices from the glory, sent from thence to tell,
Jesus lives again! Immanuel! (Immanuel!)
Other voices echo, through the Easter chime
One above all others, speaks with pow’r sublime;
Tender words of comfort, peace and love profound,
O’er the world today His words resound.(His words resound.)

Snowdrops! lift your timid heads,
All the earth is waking,
Field and forest, brown and dead,
Into life are waking;
Snowdrops, rise, and tell the story,
How He rose, the Lord of glory.
Lilies! lilies! Easter calls!
Rise to meet the dawning
Of the blessed light that falls
Through the Easter morning;
Ring your bells and tell the story,
How He rose, the Lord of glory.
Waken, sleeping butterflies,
Burst your narrow prison!
Spread your golden wings and rise,
For the Lord is risen;
Spread your wings and tell the story,
How He rose, the Lord of glory.

Far away among the angels,
In the sweet celestial bow’rs,
Start the songs whose echoes gladden
As they greet this world of ours.
Hear the echoes filled with glory,
From the bright angelic throng;
Oh, the pure seraphic music
Finds an echo in our song,
While it gently rolls along.
How they stir the soul with rapture!
How they thrill the chords of love!
How they wake the songs of praises,
Floating up to worlds above! 
Far away in worlds of glory,
We can hear the music sweet,
Where the streams of life are flowing
All along the golden street.
Far away in fields of glory
We shall meet, and God adore;
And the sweet redemption story
We shall sing forevermore.

Moses stood on holy ground
Far from God descended down
Set the roadside bush on fire (bush on fire)
Then the Lord did there explain
Through His servant should remain
All the echoes from the bush on fire (the bush on fire)
Oh the echoes from the bush (I hear those lovely echoes from the burning bush)
How they thrill my soul (how they thrill my soul)
Oh the echoes from the bush (I hear those thrilling echoes from the burning 
bush)
Point me to the goal (point me to the goal)
I no more am doubting, but with joy I'm shouting
With no thought of shame to blush (no shame to blush)
This my song shall ever be, words that are so sweet to me
Echoes from the burning bush (the burning bush)
God sent down His only Son
Just to ransom everyone
By the echoes from the fire (from the fire)
God of every earthly land
Would not pick nor choose a man
For His blood will save us from the fire (eternal fire)

People won't you listen
When I say this I'm simply not dissin
Education, know that you need it
You need it, believe it, conceive it 
I know 'cause I've been there
So let me share these few words with you
And let it be understood
Keep your mind fixed in '96
Education is the key
Stay behind me Satan not in front of me
Times are hard for the brother man
Start now prepare for you a better man
Keep your head in those books
You just don't know what it took
The blood stains remain from the innocent
Can you see why I recommend it?

Deep South, Underground Railroad
The Holocaust you know, in Nazi Germany
Bloody path to opportunity
Here is a window open it up so you can see now
Don't let their work be in vain
The pain, the shame, some went insane
When they took of their own seed
Crushed against a stone
Ooh dirty wrong, oh so dirty wrong
Sold for a penny and a dime and a nickel
Thought we were simple I beg to differ
And now we've got to strive for the right 
Stand up for the right, stand up for the right 
Won't you listen.

Elijah made a sacrifice
To offer to Jehovah;
It had been wet with water thrice,
Baal's sacrifice was over.
Elijah prayed: the fire came down
And licked the water all around;
So doubting ones believed, and found
Elijah's God was living.
Elijah's God still lives today,
To take the guilt of sin away;
And when I pray my heart's desire,
Upon my soul He sends the fire.
Elijah's God still lives today,
And answers still by fire;
My friend, just let Him have His way;
He'll grant your heart's desire,
Consume the sacrifice you make;
And bid your slumb'ring soul awake;
The chain of inbred sin will break;
Elijah's God is living.
Elijah's God still lives today,
And answers still in power,
As when Elijah prayed for rain,
God answered with a shower.
If you would have your soul refreshed,
With rain that falls from heaven,
You must pray thro' like all the rest,
And showers shall be given.

To You O Lord my God
I make this simple prayer
Surrendering my life
Wholeheartedly to You
Painful disappointments
Is all this world can offer
But You O Lord my God 
Bring me tranquillity 
Embrace me now my Lord!
Embrace me now my Lord!
I want to feel Your presence
Deep down inside my soul
Embrace me now my Lord!
Embrace me now my Lord!
I want to feel Your power
Deep down inside my soul

To adore You, to exalt You
We are together on Your altar
We want to give You honour and praise
Please You with all of our love!
Not to ask You, only to thank You
And Your holy name glorify
Our entire heart needs more of
Needs more of Your power
Embrace Your people O my Lord
Embrace us with Your amazing love
We want to feel Your hands
Pour down upon us Your holy presence
I know You are here, we all can feel
Your holy presence among us
It’s so good to be very close to You
We want to hear Your voic.

HERE I LABOR AND TOIL AS I LOOK FOR A HOME
JUST AN HUMBLE ABODE AMONG MEN
WHILE IN HEAVEN A MANSION IS WITING FOR ME
AND A GENTLE VOICE PLEADING COME IN
THERE?S A MANSION NOW EMPTY JUST WAITING FOR ME
AT THE END OF LIFE?S TROUBLESOME WAY
MANY FRIENDS AND DEAR LOVED ONES WILL WELCOME ME THERE
NEAR THE DOOR OF THAT MANSION SOME DAY
WHEN MY LABOR AND TOILING HAVE ENDED BE LOW
AND MY HANDS SHALL BE FOLDED IN REST
I?LL EX CHANGE THIS OLD HOME FOR A MANSION UP THERE
AND INVITE THE ARCH ANGEL AS GUESTS
THERE?S A MANSION NOW EMPTY JUST WAITING FOR ME
AT THE END OF LIFE?S TROUBLESOME WAY
MANY FRIENDS AND DEAR LOVED ONES WILL WELCOME ME THERE
NEAR THE DOOR OF THAT MANSION SOME DA.

Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers, rise.
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies.
Against the foe in vales below
Let all our strength be hurled.
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world.
Faith is the victory! Faith is the victory!
O glorious victory, that overcomes the world.
His banner over us is love,
Our sword the Word of God.
We tread the road the saints above
With shouts of triumph trod.
By faith, they like a whirlwind’s breath,
Swept on o’er every field.
The faith by which they conquered death
Is still our shining shield.
On every hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array.
Let tents of ease be left behind,
And onward to the fray.
Salvation’s helmet on each head,
With truth all girt about,
The earth shall tremble ’neath our tread,
And echo with our shout.
To him that overcomes the foe,
White raiment shall be giv’n.
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in Heav’n.
Then onward from the hill of light,
Our hearts with love aflame,
We’ll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus’ conqu’ring Name.

O Christ divine, O God of love,
Thou source of every good;
I’ll live in time and heav’n above,
And serve Thee as I should.
Endearing Lord! Majestic One!
With radiant glories crowned;
Oh, Thou hast conquered, I have come,
Thy pard’ning grace I’ve found.
Sweet peace and love now reign within,
Like rolling rivers flow;
Thus keeping all my life from sin
In this vain world below.
My life and breath are in Thy hand,
My joys and all I know;
I live and breathe at Thy command—
Then shall I leave Thee? No.
Lord, if I had ten thousand lives,
I’d give them all to Thee;
Thy matchless goodness surely proves
Thy wondrous love to me.
Majestic Christ! O dearest Friend!
Thou princely One so pure;
Let men and angel voices blend,
Thy royal name adore.

Saviour of my soul,
Lover of my life,
I love You endlessly,
Passion of my heart,
Everything You are,
I love You endlessly.
You love me, 
Before I knew of You,
You love me,
Now I give it back to You.
With Your Majesty here,
I fall to my knees,
I love You endlessly,
With the beaty of Your Son,
I find myself undone.
I love You endlessly.
Saviour of my soul,
Lover of my life,
I love You endlessly.
Passion of my heart,
Everything You Are,
I love You endlessly.
You love me,
Before I knew of You,
You love me,
Now I give it back to You.
With Your Majesty here,
I fall to my knees,
I love You endlessly,
With the beaty of Your Son,
I find myself undone.
I love You endlessly.
You love me,
Before I knew of You,
You love me,
Now I give it back to You.[x2]
With Your Majesty here,
I fall to my knees,
I love You endlessly,
With the beaty of Your Son,
I find myself undone.
I love You endlessly.[x4]
Endlessly

I went to the enemy's camp
And I took back what he stole from me,
I took back what he stole from me,
Took back what he stole from me.
I went to the enemy's camp
And I took back what he stole from me.
He's under my feet,
He's under my feet,
He's under my feet,
He's under my feet,
He's under my feet,
He's under my feet,
Satan is under my feet.

Enjoy your life today,
Skies be they bright or grey,
All's but a dream.
He let us choose the way,
All that we do and say,
What right we deem.
What right we deem.
Live as you plan to die,
At peace with all that vie
For space on earth.
Don't dwell on vengeful thought,
Be glad what God hath wrought,
For us to share,
For us to bear.
If life is living hell,
Did you not help as well?
Whom did you fear.
Heaven is in your mind.
If you're at peace you'll find.
Heaven is near.
Heaven is here.
Heaven's reward's unknown,
None sent a letter home
Advising you.
Memories of you, is all
People you've met, recall,
Good and bad too,
Bad and good too.
Is life a blink of eye?
Is life a soul to vie
Eternally?
Those who you leave behind
Will let you live, in mind,
A short time or
For evermore.

Living by faith
Is a thing that's hard to do
Enoch was a man
Whose faith was strong and true
For 300 years
Enoch walked with God each day
Then he was no more
For God took him away 
God took Enoch from this life
He was gone from earth but he did not die
Enoch's steadfast saving faith
Pleased God and He took him away 
Faith is belief in God
Though he can't be seen
And without faith
He is impossible to please
For God rewards those
Who seek him earnestly
And as he did with Enoch
He will take them away 
(Took him away, took him away) 
(interlude)

There comes a time in this life
You get tired of trying again
A thousand questions resound in your mind
Justifications you can’t understand
So how do you get out of this cycle?
What can you do to stop your pain?
Just use the power already inside you
Nothing to lose everything to gain
The hour has come, there’s no doubt
I am drawing a line in the sand
Enough is enough, is my shout
No turning back, this is where I stand!

Enslaved by sin and bound in chains,
Beneath its dreadful tyrant sway,
And doomed to everlasting pains,
We wretched, guilty captives lay.
Nor gold nor gems could buy our peace,
Nor all the world’s collected store
Suffice to purchase our release;
A thousand worlds were all too poor.
Jesus, the Lord, the mighty God,
An all sufficient ransom paid.
O matchless price! His precious blood
For vile, rebellious traitors shed.
Jesus the Sacrifice became
To rescue guilty souls from hell;
The spotless, bleeding, dying Lamb
Beneath avenging Justice fell.
Amazing goodness! Love divine!
Oh, may our grateful hearts adore
The matchless grace nor yield to sin
Nor wear its cruel fetters more!

Enter and worship here,
The Bride invites thee—Come;
The Spirit bids thee cast out fear,
And make the Church thy home.
Enter and bless the Lord,
And meditate His grace;
Feast on the manna of His Word,
And consecrate this place.
Enter and rest and pray,
Lift to the hills thine eyes;
Praise Him, and offer up today
Thy heart, a sacrifice.

O Thou, Whom all Thy saints adore,
We now with all Thy saints agree,
And bow our inmost souls before
Thy glorious, awful majesty.
Thee, King of nations, we proclaim:
Who would not our great Sovereign fear?
We long to experience all Thy Name,
And now we come to meet Thee here.
We come, great God, to seek Thy face,
And for Thy loving-kindness wait;
And O how dreadful is this place!
’Tis God’s own house, ’tis Heaven’s gate.
Tremble our hearts to find Thee nigh;
To Thee our trembling hearts aspire;
And lo! we see descend from high
The pillar and the flame of fire.
Still let it on the assembly stay,
And all the house with glory fill;
To Canaan’s bounds point out the way,
And lead us to Thy holy hill.
There let us all with Jesus stand,
And join the general church above,
And take our seats at Thy right hand,
And sing Thine everlasting love.
Come, Lord, our souls are on the wing,
Now on Thy great white throne appear,
And let my eyes behold my King,
And let me see my Savior there.

Enthroned is Jesus now,
Upon His heavenly seat;
The kingly crown is on His brow,
The saints are at His feet.
In shining white they stand,
A great and countless throng;
A palmy scepter in each hand,
On every lip a song.
They sing the Lamb of God,
Once slain on earth for them;
The Lamb, through Whose atoning blood,
Each wears his diadem.
Thy grace, O Holy Ghost,
Thy blessed help supply,
That we may join that radiant host,
Triumphant in the sky.

Enthroned on high, almighty Lord!
The Holy Ghost send down;
Fulfill in us Thy faithful word,
And all Thy mercies crown.
Though on our heads no tongues of fire
Their wondrous powers impart,
Grant, Savior, what we more desire,
Thy Spirit in our heart.
Spirit of life, and light, and love,
Thy heav’nly influence give;
Quicken our souls, our guilt remove,
That we in Christ may live.
To our benighted minds reveal
The glories of His grace.
And bring us where no clouds conceal
The brightness of His face.

Entreat me not to leave thee,
My heart goes with thee now;
Why turn my footsteps homeward?
No friend so dear as thou!
Thy heart has borne my sorrow,
And I have wept for thine;
And now how can I leave thee?
Oh, let thy lot be mine.
Entreat me not to leave thee,
Entreat me not to leave thee,
Or to return from following after thee;
For where thou goest I will go,
And where thou lodgest I will lodge;
Thy people shall be my people,
And thy God my God,
Thy people shall be my people,
And thy God my God.
I’ll follow where thou leadest;
My love will cling to thee;
And where thy head is pillowed,
My nightly rest shall be;
Thy birthplace and thy kindred
I’ll cherish like my own;
Thy God shall be my refuge,
I’ll worship at His throne.
Where death’s cold hand shall find thee,
There let my eyelids close,
And, in the grave beside thee,
This mortal frame repose:
Oh, do not now entreat me;
No friend so dear as thou;
My heart would break in anguish
If I should leave thee now.

Ere God had built the mountains,
Or raised the fruitful hills;
Before He filled the fountains
That feed the running rills;
In me from everlasting,
The wonderful I Am,
Found pleasures never wasting,
And Wisdom is my name.
When, like a tent to dwell in,
He spread the skies abroad,
And swathed about the swelling
Of Ocean’s mighty flood;
He wrought by weight and measure,
And I was with Him then:
Myself the Father’s pleasure,
And mine, the sons of men.
Thus Wisdom’s words discover
Thy glory and Thy grace,
Thou everlasting Lover
Of our unworthy race!
Thy gracious eye surveyed us
Ere stars were seen above;
In wisdom Thou hast made us,
And died for us in love.
And couldst Thou be delighted
With creatures such as we,
Who, when we saw Thee, slighted,
And nailed Thee to a tree?
Unfathomable wonder,
And mystery divine!
The voice that speaks in thunder,
Says, “Sinner, I am thine!"

Ere I sleep, for every favor,
This day showed, by my God,
I will bless my Savior.
O my Lord, what shall I render
To Thy Name, still the same,
Gracious, good, and tender?
Leave me not, but ever love me;
Let Thy peace, be my bliss,
Till Thou hence remove me.

Ere in thy childhood, 'mid the desert places,
thou hadst a refuge from the city gained,
far from all slander and its bitter traces
living unstained.
Often had prophets in the distant ages
sung to announce the Daystar and to name him;
but as the Savior, last of all the sages,
thou didst proclaim him.
Than John the Baptist, none of all Eve's daughters
'ere bore a greater, whether high or lowly:
he was thought worthy, washing in the waters
Jesus the holy.
Angels in orders everlasting praise thee,
God, in thy triune majesty tremendous;
hark to the prayers we, penitents, upraise thee:
save and defend us.

Ere mountains reared their forms sublime,
Or Heav’n and earth in order stood,
Before the birth of ancient time,
From everlasting Thou art God.
A thousand ages, in their flight,
With Thee are as a fleeting day;
Past, present, future, to Thy sight
At once their various scenes display.
But our brief life’s a shadowy dream,
A passing thought that soon is o’er,
That fades with morning’s earliest beam,
And fills the musing mind no more.
To us, O Lord, the wisdom give
Each passing moment so to spend,
That we at length with Thee may live
Where life and bliss shall never end.

Ere the blue heav’ns were stretched abroad,
From everlasting was the Word:
With God He was; the Word was God,
And must divinely be adored.
By His own power were all things made;
By Him supported all things stand;
He is the whole creation’s Head,
And angels fly at His command.
Ere sin was born, or Satan fell,
He led the host of morning stars:
Thy generation who can tell,
Or count the numbers of Thy years?
But lo! He leaves those heav’nly forms,
The Word descends and dwells in clay,
That He may hold converse with worms,
Dressed in such feeble flesh as they.
Mortals with joy beheld His face,
Th’ eternal Father’s only Son;
How full of truth! how full of grace!
When through His eyes the Godhead shone.
Archangels leave their high abode
To learn new mysteries here, and tell
The loves of our descending God,
The glories of Immanuel.

Ere yet the dawn has filled the skies,
Behold, my Savior Christ arise;
He chaseth from us sin and night,
And brings us joy and life and light.
O stronger Thou than death and hell!
Where is the foe Thou canst not quell,
What heavy stone Thou canst not roll
From off the prisoned, anguished soul?
If Jesus lives, can I be sad?
I know He loves me, and am glad;
Though all the world were dead to me,
Enough, O Christ, if I have Thee!
He feeds me, comforts and defends,
And when I die His angel sends
To bear me whither He is gone,
For of His own He loseth none.
Strong Champion! For this comfort, see,
The whole world brings her thanks to Thee;
And once we, too, shall raise above
More sweet and loud the song of love.

Ere you left your room this morning,
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ our Savior,
Did you sue for loving favor,
As a shield today?
O how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Don’t forget to pray.
When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit,
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay?
When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way?
When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates of day?

Eternal Beam of light divine,
Fountain of unexhausted love,
In Whom the Father’s glories shine
Through earth beneath, and Heaven above;
Jesu, the weary wanderer’s rest,
Give me Thy easy yoke to bear,
With steadfast patience arm my breast,
With spotless love, and lowly fear.
Thankful I take the cup from Thee,
Prepared and mingled by Thy skill,
Though bitter to the taste it be,
Powerful the wounded soul to heal.
Be Thou, O Rock of ages, nigh!
So shall each murmuring thought be gone,
And grief, and fear, and care, shall fly,
As clouds before the mid-day sun.
Speak to my warring passions, “Peace!"
Say to my trembling heart, “Be still!"
Thy power my strength and fortress is,
For all things serve Thy sovereign will.
O death! where is thy sting? Where now
Thy boasted victory, O grave?
Who shall contend with God? or who
Can hurt whom God delights to save?

Eternal depth of love divine,
In Jesus, God with us, displayed;
How bright Thy beaming glories shine!
How wide Thy healing streams are spread!
With whom dost Thou delight to dwell?
Sinners, a vile and thankless race:
O God, what tongue aright can tell
How vast Thy love, how great Thy grace!
The dictates of Thy sovereign will
With joy our grateful hearts receive:
All Thy delight in us fulfill;
Lo! all we are to Thee we give.
To Thy sure love, Thy tender care,
Our flesh, soul, spirit, we resign:
O fix Thy sacred presence there,
And seal the abode for ever Thine.
O King of glory, Thy rich grace
Our feeble thought surpasses far;
Yea, even our crimes, though numberless,
Less numerous than Thy mercies are.
Still, Lord, Thy saving health display,
And arm our souls with heav’nly zeal;
So fearless shall we urge our way
Through all the powers of earth and hell.

Eternal Father, Thou hast said
That Christ all glory shall obtain;
That He Who once a suff’rer bled
Shall o’er the world a conqu’ror reign.
We wait Thy triumph, Savior King,
Long ages have prepared Thy way;
Now all abroad Thy banner fling,
Set time’s great battle in array.
Thy hosts are mustered to the field;
 “The Cross! the Cross!" the battle call;
The old grim towers of darkness yield,
And soon shall totter to their fall.
On mountain tops the watch fires glow,
Where scattered wide the watchmen stand;
Voice echoes voice, and onward flow
The joyous shouts from land to land.
Oh, fill the Church with faith and power!
Bid her long nights of weeping cease;
To groaning nations haste the hour
Of life and freedom, light and peace.
Come, Spirit, make Thy wonders known,
Fulfill the Father’s high decree;
Then earth, the might of hell o’er thrown,
Shall keep her last great jubilee.

Eternal Father, when to Thee,
Beyond all worlds, by faith I soar,
Before Thy boundless majesty
I stand in silence, and adore.
But Savior, Thou art by my side;
Thy voice I hear, Thy face I see:
Thou art my Friend, my daily Guide;
God over all, yet God with me.
And Thou, great Spirit, in my heart,
Dost make Thy temple day by day;
The Holy Ghost of God Thou art,
Yet dwellest in this house of clay.
Blest Trinity, in Whom alone
All things created move or rest,
High in the heavens Thou hast Thy throne;
Thou hast Thy throne within my breast.

Eternal Glory of the sky,
Blest Hope of frail humanity,
The Father’s sole begotten One,
Yet born a spotless virgin’s Son!
Uplift us with Thine arm of might,
And let our hearts rise pure and bright,
And, ardent in God’s praises, pay
The thanks we owe him every day.
The day-star’s rays are glittering clear,
And tell that day itself is near:
The shadows of the night depart;
Thou, holy Light, illume the heart!
Within our senses ever dwell,
And worldly darkness thence expel;
Long as the days of life endure,
Preserve our souls devout and pure.
The faith that first must be possessed,
Root deep within our inmost breast;
And joyous hope in second place,
Then charity, Thy greatest grace.
All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete.

Eternal God, how they’re increased
Who greatly trouble me!
How many are the men that stand
In triumph over me!

Eternal God, Whose power upholds
Both flower and flaming star,
To Whom there is no here nor there,
No time, no near nor far,
No alien race, no foreign shore,
No child unsought, unknown,
O send us forth, Thy prophets true,
To make all lands Thine own!
O God of love, Whose Spirit wakes
In every human breast,
Whom love, and love alone can know,
In Whom all hearts find rest,
Help us to spread Thy gracious reign
Till greed and hate shall cease,
And kindness dwell in human hearts,
And all the earth find peace!
O God of truth, Whom science seeks
And reverent souls adore,
Who lightest every earnest mind
Of every clime and shore,
Dispel the gloom of error’s night,
Of ignorance and fear,
Until true wisdom from above
Shall make life’s pathway clear!
O God of beauty, oft revealed
In dreams of human art,
In speech that flows to melody,
In holiness of heart,
Teach us to ban all ugliness
That blinds our eyes to Thee,
Till all shall know the loveliness
Of lives made fair and free.
O God of righteousness and grace,
Seen in the Christ, Thy Son,
Whose life and death reveal Thy face,
By Whom Thy will was done.
Inspire Thy heralds of good news
To live Thy life divine,
Till Christ has formed in all mankind
And every land is Thine!

Eternal God, your love's tremendous glory
cascades through life in overflowing grace,
to tell creation's meaning in the story
of love evolving love from time and space.
Eternal Son of God, uniquely precious,
in you, deserted, scorned, crucified,
God's love has fathomed sin and death's deep darkness,
and flawed humanity is glorified.
Eternal Spirit, with us like a mother,
embracing us in love serene and pure:
you nurture strength to follow Christ our brother,
as full-grown children, confident and sure.
Love's trinity, self-perfect, self-sustaining;
love which commands, enables, and obeys:
you give yourself, in boundless joy, creating
one vast increasing harmony of praise.
We ask you now, complete your image in us;
this love of yours, our source and guide and goal.
May love in us seek love and serve love's purpose,
till we ascend with Christ and find love whole.

Eternal life is in God’s Word
For dead and dying men;
By it alone we know the Lord,
Unseen by mortal ken.
O blessed Word, O gracious Word,
We’ll love thee more and more;
Be thou our Life, our Strength, our Sword,
 ’Till earthly strife is o’er.
God’s strength is in His holy Word;
We need it ev’ry day;
In all our conflicts this the sword
Our spirit foes to slay.
By this same Word we know our task,
And how it should be done;
How now to live, and how at last
Our crown is to be won.

Eternal Light! eternal Light!
How pure the soul must be
When, placed within Thy searching sight,
It shrinks not, but with calm delight
Can live, and look on Thee!
The spirits that surround Thy throne
May bear the burning bliss;
But that is surely theirs alone,
Since they have never, never known
A fallen world like this.
O how shall I, whose native sphere
Is dark, whose mind is dim,
Before the Ineffable appear,
And on my naked spirit bear
That uncreated beam?
There is a way for man to rise
To that sublime abode:
An offering and a sacrifice,
A Holy Spirit’s energies,
An Advocate with God.
These, these prepare us for the sight
Of holiness above;
The sons of ignorance and night,
May dwell in the eternal Light,
Through the eternal Love.

Eternal Light, Divinity,
O Unity in Trinity,
thy holy name thy servants bless,
to thee we pray, and thee confess.
We praise the Father, mighty One;
we praise the sole-begotten Son;
we praise the Holy Ghost above,
who joins them in one bond of love.
For of the Father infinite,
begotten is the Light of light,
and from his love eternally
proceeds the Spirit, God most high.
None can more high or holy be,
co-equal is their Deity,
the substance of the Three is One,
and equal laud to them is done.
The Three are One Immensity,
the Three One highest Verity,
the Three One perfect Charity,
and they are man's Felicity.
O Verity! O Charity!
O Ending and Felicity!
In thee we hope, in thee believe,
thyself we love, to thee we cleave.
Thou First and Last, from whom there springs
the Fount of all created things,
thou art the Life which moves the whole,
sure Hope of each believing soul.
Thou who alone the world hast made,
art still its one sufficing aid,
the only Light for gazing eyes,
and, unto them that hope, the Prize.
O Father, Source of God the Word,
O Word with him co-equal Lord,
O Spirit of like majesty,
O Triune God, all praise to thee.

Eternal Monarch, King most high,
Whose blood hath brought redemption nigh,
By Whom the death of Death was wrought,
And conquering grace’s battle fought.
Ascending to the throne of might,
And seated at the Father’s right,
All power in Heav’n is Jesu’s own,
That here His manhood had not known.
That so, in nature’s triple frame,
Each heav’nly and each earthly name,
And things in hell’s abyss abhorred,
May bend the knee and own Him Lord.
Yea, angels tremble when they see
How changed is our humanity;
That flesh hath purged what flesh had stained,
And God, the Flesh of God, hath reigned.
Be Thou our joy and strong defense,
Who art our future recompense;
So shall the light that springs from Thee
Be ours through all eternity.
O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
All praise to Thee let earth accord,
Who art, while endless ages run,
With Father and with Spirit One.

Eternal One, Thou living God,
Whom changing years unchanged reveal,
With Thee their way our fathers trod;
The hand they held, in ours we feel.
The same our trust, the same our need,
In sorrow’s stress, in duty’s hour;
We keep their faith, by Thee decreed,
That faith the fount of all our power.
We bless Thee for the growing light;
Th’advancing thought, the wid’ning view,
The larger freedom, clearer sight,
Which from the old unfolds the new.
With wider view, come loftier goal;
With fuller light, more good to see;
With freedom, truer self control,
With knowledge, deeper reverence be.
Anew we pledge ourselves to Thee,
To follow where Thy truth shall lead;
Afloat upon its boundless sea,
Who sails with God is safe indeed!

Eternal Power, of earth and air!
Unseen, yet seen in all around,
Remote, but dwelling everywhere,
Though silent, heard in every sound.
If e’er Thine ear in mercy bent,
When wretched mortals cried to Thee,
And if, indeed, Thy Son was sent,
To save lost sinners such as me:
Then hear me now, while, kneeling here,
I lift to thee my heart and eye,
And all my soul ascends in prayer,
Oh, give me, give me faith! I cry.
Without some glimmering in my heart,
I could not raise this fervent prayer;
But, oh! a stronger light impart,
And in Thy mercy fix it there.
While Faith is with me, I am blest;
It turns my darkest night to day;
But while I clasp it to my breast,
I often feel it slide away.
Then, cold and dark, my spirit sinks,
To see my light of life depart;
And every fiend of Hell, methinks,
Enjoys the anguish of my heart.
What shall I do, if all my love,
My hopes, my toil, are cast away,
And if there be no God above,
To hear and bless me when I pray?
If this be vain delusion all,
If death be an eternal sleep,
And none can hear my secret call,
Or see the silent tears I weep!
Oh, help me, God! For Thou alone
Canst my distracted soul relieve;
Forsake it not: it is Thine own,
Though weak, yet longing to believe.
Oh, drive these cruel doubts away;
And make me know, that Thou art God!
A faith, that shines by night and day,
Will lighten every earthly load.
If I believe that Jesus died,
And, waking, rose to reign above;
Then surely Sorrow, Sin, and Pride,
Must yield to Peace, and Hope, and Love.
And all the blessed words He said
Will strength and holy joy impart:
A shield of safety o’er my head,
A spring of comfort in my heart.

Eternal Power, Whose high abode
Becomes the grandeur of a God,
Infinite lengths beyond the bounds
Where stars resolve their little rounds!
The lowest step around Thy seat,
Rises too high for Gabriel’s feet;
In vain the favored angel tries
To reach Thine height with wond’ring eyes.
There while the first archangel sings,
He hides his face behind his wings,
And ranks of shining thrones around
Fall worshiping, and spread the ground.
Lord, what shall earth and ashes do?
We would adore our Maker, too;
From sin and dust to Thee we cry,
The Great, the Holy, and the High.
Earth from afar has heard Thy fame,
And worms have learned to lisp Thy Name;
But, O! the glories of Thy mind
Leave all our soaring thoughts behind.
God is in Heaven, and men below;
Be short our tunes, our words be few;
A solemn reverence checks our songs,
And praise sits silent on our tongues.

Time’s clock is striking the hour,
Jesus will soon descend,
Clothed in the garments of power,
The reign of sin to end.
Then will this anthem be ringing
Like to a mighty flood,
Then ’round the throne we’ll be singing,
Glory and praise to God.
Glory, glory to God!
Thus will the ransomed sing;
Glory, glory to God,
The everlasting King!
Praise Him, alleluia!
To that eternal sphere
We are waiting
For our translating;
The time is near.
In those bright mansions supernal,
Death cannot enter there;
Ages on ages eternal
His likeness we shall bear.
There will the once brokenhearted
Rest in the spirit know;
Sorrow forever departed,
Gladness shall overflow.
Sighing forever is ended,
Foes shall oppress no more;
Voices in worship are blended
To Him Whom all adore.
Bathed in the light soft and tender,
Sealed for eternity,
Praise to the Lamb we will render—
Worthy of praise is He.
Beautiful, wonderful story!
Jesus Himself the Light;
There in the kingdom of glory
Never shall fall the night.
Now I am singing of heaven,
While here I wage the strife;
Then will the victors be given
Crowns of eternal life.

Eternal Ruler of the ceaseless round
Of circling planets singing on their way,
Guide of the nations from the night profound
Into the glory of the perfect day,
Rule in our hearts, that we may ever be
Guided and strengthened and upheld by Thee.
We are of Thee, the children of Thy love,
The brothers of Thy well beloved Son;
Descend, O Holy Spirit, like a dove
Into our hearts, that we may be as one;
As one with Thee, to Whom we ever tend;
As one with Him our Brother and our Friend.
We would be one in hatred of all wrong,
One in our love of all things sweet and fair;
One with the joy that breaketh into song,
One with the grief that trembleth into prayer,
One in the power that makes Thy children free
To follow truth, and thus to follow Thee.
O clothe us with Thy heavenly armor, Lord,
Thy trusty shield, Thy sword of love divine;
Our inspiration be Thy constant Word;
We ask no victories that are not Thine;
Give or withhold, let pain or pleasure be,
Enough to know that we are serving Thee.

Eternal Son, eternal Love,
Take to Thyself Thy mighty power;
Let all earth’s sons Thy mercy prove;
Let all Thy saving grace adore.
The triumphs of Thy love display;
In every heart reign Thou alone;
Till all Thy foes confess Thy sway,
And glory ends what grace began.
Spirit of grace with health and power,
Fountain of light and love below,
Abroad Thy healing influence shower,
O’er all the nations let it flow.
Inflame our hearts with perfect love;
In us the work of faith fulfill,
So not Heav’n’s host shall swifter move
Than we on earth, to do Thy will.

Eternal Source of Every Joy
Well may Thy praise our lips employ,
While in Thy temple we appear
To hail Thee Sov'reign of the year.
Wide as the wheels of nature roll
Thy hand supports and guides the whole;
The sun is taught by thee to rise,
And darkness when to veil the skies.
The flow'ry spring at thy command
Perfumes the air and paints the land;
The summer rays with vigor shine
To raise the corn and cheer the vine.
Thy hand, in autumn, richly pours
Through all our coasts redundant stores;
And winters, softened by thy care
No more the face of horror wear.
Seasons and months, and weeks and days,
Demand successive songs of praise;
And be the grateful homage paid,
With morning light and ev'ning shade.
Here in thy house let incense rise,
And sweet devotion bless our eyes
Till to those lofty heights we soar,
Where days and years revolve no more.

Eternal Spirit of the living Christ,
I know not how to ask or what to say;
I only know my need, as deep as life,
and only you can teach me how to pray.
Come, pray in me the prayer I need this day;
help me to see your purpose and your will 
where I have failed, what I have done amiss;
held in forgiving love, let me be still.
Come with the strength I lack, the vision clear
of neighbor's need, of all humanity;
fulfilment of my life in love outpoured;
my life in you, O Christ; your love in me.

Eternal Spirit! Praise we bring—
The wonders of Thy grace to sing;
Thy pow'r conveys our blessings down
From God the Father and the Son.
Enlightened by Thy heav'nly ray,
Our shades and darkness turn to day;
Thine inward teachings make us view
Our danger and our refuge, too.
Thy pow'r and glory work within,
And break the chains of reigning sin;
Do our imperious lusts subdue,
And form our wretched hearts anew.
The troubled conscience knows Thy voice,
Thy cheering words our hearts rejoice;
At Thy blest Word life's storms are calm,
And troubled minds find heav'nly balm.

Eternal Spirit! we confess
And sing the wonders of Thy grace
Thy power conveys our blessings down
From God the Father and the Son.
Enlightened by Thine heav’nly ray,
Our shades and darkness turn to day;
Thine inward teachings make us know
Our danger and our refuge too.
Thy power and glory work within,
And break the chains of reigning sin;
Do our imperious lusts subdue,
And form our wretched hearts anew.
The troubled conscience knows Thy voice,
Thy cheering words awake our joys;
Thy words allay the stormy wind,
And calm the surges of the mind.

Eternal Wisdom! Thee we praise,
Thee the creation sings,
With Thy loved Name, rocks, hills, and seas,
And Heaven’s high palace rings.
Thy hand, how wide it spreads the sky!
How glorious to behold!
Tinged with a blue of heavenly dye,
And starred with sparkling gold.
There Thou hast bid the globes of light
Their endless circles run;
There the pale planet rules the night,
The day obeys the sun.
If down I turn my wondering eyes
On clouds and storms below,
Those under-regions of the skies
Thy numerous glories show.
The noisy winds stand ready there
Thy orders to obey;
With sounding wings they sweep the air,
To make Thy chariot way.
There, like a trumpet loud and strong,
Thy thunder shakes our coast,
While the red lightnings wave along,
The banners of Thy host.
On the thin air, without a prop,
Hang fruitful showers around;
At Thy command they sink, and drop
Their fatness on the ground.
Lo! here Thy wondrous skill arrays
The earth in cheerful green;
A thousand herbs Thy art displays,
A thousand flowers between.
There, the rough mountains of the deep
Obey Thy strong command,
Thy breath can raise the billows steep,
Or sink them to the sand.
Thy glories blaze all nature round,
And strike the wondering sight
Through skies, and seas, and solid ground,
With terror and delight.
Infinite strength and equal skill
Shine through Thy works abroad.
Our souls with vast amazement fill.
And speak the builder God.
But the mild glories of Thy grace
Our softer passions move;
Pity divine in Jesu’s face
We see, adore, and love.

Lord my life You know clearly seeing where I need to grow
As You work in me cleansing all of my impurities
Lord I thank You for loving me just as I am
Though I'm weak by myself in Your strength I will stand
Your grace is sufficient for me.eternally Your's
You're all I need and it's all I can do (eternally Your's)
To surrender my will in submission to You (eternally Your's)
Your grace is sufficient for me .eternally Your's
As I learn from You, Jesus, patiently You lead me through
Though I often fail, stumbling, You assure Your love prevai.

Deep and grand in tones sublime,
Hear the passing bells of time,
Ring the dirge of moments dead,
Golden hours whose joys are fled—
Still those bells of time we hear,
Tolling, tolling: Hark! the word:
Eternity!
Eternity!
Eternity!
In the rosy morning fair,
In the sultry noonday glare,
In the dewy evening bright,
In the silent hush of night—
Still those bells of time we hear,
Tolling, tolling, loud and clear:
When with breaking heart we bend,
O’er a tried and faithful friend,
When the parting hour draws nigh,
And we catch the last “goodbye"—
Still those bells of time we hear,
Tolling, tolling, loud and clear:
Precious word! if safe we stand
On the Christian’s borderland
Trusting Him, Whose loving smile
Lights and cheers us all the while—
Bells of time with joy we hear,
Tolling, tolling, sweet and clear:

Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
Night and day they never cease;
We are wearied with their chime,
For they do not bring us peace;
And we hush our breath to hear,
And we strain our eyes to see
If thy shores are drawing near,
Eternity! Eternity!
Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
Now their changes rise and fall,
But in under tone sublime,
Sounding clearly through them all,
Is a voice that must be heard,
As our moments onward flee,
And it speaketh, aye, one word,
Eternity! Eternity!
Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
To their voices, loud and low,
In a long, unresting line
We are marching to and fro;
And we yearn for sight or sound,
Of the life that is to be,
For thy breath doth wrap us round,
Eternity! Eternity!
Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
Soon their notes will all be dumb,
And in joy and peace sublime,
We shall feel the silence come;
And our souls their thirst will slake,
And our eyes the King will see,
When thy glorious morn shall break,
Eternity! Eternity.

Most any day, a sound will be made
That's never been heard before.
And when it's made, it will burst open the grave
Of everyone that went to sleep, in the lone.
And those that remain, in a moment will be changed.
With the brightness of heaven all around.
There'll be praise, there'll be singing
Heaven's bells will be ringing.
When that cloud starts coming down.
() 
On this cloud there'll be our savior,
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, God's son.
Rising up his church, to join him.
Oh Hallelujah, eternity has begun.
Now when his glorious church, leaves a simple world
And goes home to the place he's prepared.
Fire and brimstone will reign, on everything that
remains
And the fire will fill the very air.
Oh but those who are saved, will have done left their
graves.
Glorified, robed in white, gone home.
Where we'll praise him forever, in a land where night
comes never.
When his glorious church goes home.
(To )

Tomorrow morn, O joy all words transcending,
Our God will come in eucharistic guise,
Our hearts with His in sweet communion blending,
Will raptured taste the bliss of Paradise.
Oh Mother loved, our cold hearts prepare,
Thy Jesus seeks to make His dwelling there;
With virtue bright thy children's hearts adorn,
For in their depths He'll rest tomorrow morn,
For in their depths He'll rest tomorrow morn.
Now fading fast day's briliant rays declining,
Tell that the morn, the day of love is near,
That soon the Sun of Justice brightly shining
In mercy veiled will to our souls appear.
Oh Mother loved, our cold hearts prepare,
Thy Jesus seeks to make His dwelling there;
With virtue bright thy children's hearts adorn,
For in their depths He'll rest tomorrow morn,
For in their depths He'll rest tomorrow morn.
Another morn will come, too sacred seeming,
When we may say farewell to mortal strife;
Haste, Haste, that dawn, now in the future gleaming,
The morn that leads us to eternal life.
Oh Mother loved, our cold hearts prepare,
Thy Jesus seeks to make His dwelling there;
With virtue bright thy children's hearts adorn,
For in their depths He'll rest tomorrow morn,
For in their depths He'll rest tomorrow morn.

Lord, I hear of showers of blessing,
Thou art scattering full and free;
Showers the thirsty land refreshing;
Let some drops now fall on me;
Even me, even me,
Let some drops now fall on me.
Pass me not, O God, my Father,
Sinful though my heart may be;
Thou mightst leave me, but the rather;
Let Thy mercy light on me;
Even me, even me,
Let Thy mercy light on me.
Pass me not, O gracious Savior,
Let me live and cling to Thee;
I am longing for Thy favor;
Whilst Thou’rt calling, O call me;
Even me, even me,
Whilst Thou’rt calling, O call me.
Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
Thou canst make the blind to see;
Witnesser of Jesus’ merit,
Speak the Word of power to me;
Even me, even me,
Speak the Word of power to me.
Have I been in sin long sleeping,
Long been slighting, grieving Thee?
Has the world my heart been keeping?
O forgive and rescue me;
Even me, even me,
O forgive and rescue me.
Love of God, so pure and changeless,
Blood of Christ, so rich and free;
Grace of God, so strong and boundless
Magnify them all in me;
Even me, even me,
Magnify them all in me.
Pass me not; but pardon bringing,
Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee;
Whilst the streams of life are springing,
Blessing others, O bless me;
Even me, even me,
Blessing others, O bless me.

Evening and morning, sunset and dawning,
Wealth, peace and gladness, comfort in sadness,
These are Thy works; all the glory be Thine!
Times without number, awake or in slumber,
Thine eye observes us, from danger preserves us,
Causing Thy mercy upon us to shine.
Father, O hear me, pardon and spare me;
Calm all my terrors, blot out my errors,
That by Thine eyes they may no more be scanned.
Order my goings, direct all my doings;
As it may please Thee retain or release me;
All I commit to Thy fatherly hand.

Lord, the shades of night are gently soothing nature into rest,
And Thy love, to us unfolding, moves devotion in our breast,
Round the sacred fam’ly altar, we would close our pligrim days,
Make the evening vocal with our hymns of praise.
One more day of life is gone, O gracious Father,
Thou hast sweetly kept us since we rose;
Now accept the evening praise we offer,
Ere in Thy arms we seek repose.
Glory to the name of Jesus, for salvation all the day!
For Thy wall of love around us, keeping evil far away;
Humbly in Thy presence bowing, Father, we implore Thy grace,
That no sinful shadow hide Thy smiling face.
Father, keep us ever holy, till our sun of life is set,
Like the twilight’s golden glory, may Thy presence linger yet;
Fold us in Thy arms of mercy, as we lay our bodies down,
In the final morning give us all a crown.

Evensong is hushed in silence,
and the hour of rest is nigh:
strengthen us for work tomorrow,
Son of Mary, God most high.
Thou who in the village workshop,
fashioning the yoke and plow,
didst eat bread by daily labor,
succor them that labor now.
Treading the path of lifelong toil,
and weary of pain and sin,
we look for the city with streets of gold,
where all is peace within.
How are we to reach that city,
whose delights no tongue may tell?
By the faith that looks to Jesus,
by a life of doing well:
sinful men and sinful women,
he will wash our sins away;
he will take us to the sheepfold,
whence no sheep can ever stray.
Treading the path of lifelong toil,
and weary of pain and sin,
we look for the city with streets of gold,
where all is peace within.
There the dear ones who have left us
we shall some day meet again;
there will be no bitter partings,
no more sorrow, death or pain.
Evensong has closed in silence,
and the hour of rest is nigh:
lighten thou our darkness, Jesus,
Son of Mary, God most high.
Treading the path of lifelong toil,
and weary of pain and sin,
we look for the city with streets of gold,
where all is peace within.

Pilgrim of Jesus, o’er life’s troubled sea,
Courage, and onward pursue;
A crown of rejoicing is waiting for thee,
Ever keep heaven in view.
Ever keep heaven in view,
Ever keep heaven in view;
Courage, my brother, right onward pursue,
Ever keep heaven in view.
Pilgrim of Jesus, what saddens thy brow?
Are not His promises true?
How needless thy sorrow, He’s bidding thee now,
Ever keep heaven in view.
Pilgrim of Jesus, oh, lift up thy head,
Ask and thy strength He’ll renew;
And, while in the footprints of Jesus you tread,
Ever keep heaven in view.
Pilgrim of Jesus, that Eden above
Long has been waiting for you;
And soon thou shalt reach thy fair mansion of love,
Ever keep heaven in view.

Out on this dark world, Savior, am I,
Be Thou my helper, oh, hear my cry;
Thou art my portion, all is in Thee,
Oh, let Thy mighty hand ever lead me.
Wilt Thou lead me by the hand? 
Hope of my heart, Lord, strength of my soul,
Guide Thou my footsteps and keep me whole;
My grace and fortress, Lord, Thou wilt be,
Oh, let Thy mighty hand ever lead me.
Calm Thou the wild storm, clear up the way,
Keep me from falling, by night and day;
Trav’ling to glory, walking with Thee,
Oh, let Thy mighty hand ever lead me.

Ever so gently, your spirit calls to all who hear
Every so gently, the sound of your voice quiet yet clear
Day and night, to the ends of the earth
The skies pour forth speech
There's no place your voice isn't heard
Your patience astounds me
Your voice is the sweetest of sounds
It's the purest of life giving rain
Your voice is the calm in the storm
It's the whisper of love that remains
Ever so gently, I hear your voice pulling me near
Ever so gently, your word of life stronger than fear
If I turn away from your heart
Try to hide in my shame
You speak truth in love's patient way
Your gentleness breaks me

From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God
From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God
In holiness you stand secure through culture's shifting sands
Unchanged by all the vanities of man
And as the nations rise and fall your sovereignty remains
You are, you are, you are the one true God
From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God
From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God
In faithfulness your love extends through times of turbulence
Adopting those who call upon your name
And every generation joins in songs of grateful praise
You are, you are, you are the one true God
From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God
From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God
Eternal, immortal, invisible, God
Eternal, immortal, invisible, God

Never let me stray from the truth of cavalry.
And let not my heart forget, Your sacrifice of love.
Like an overflowing river is the life You give to me.
I want to re - mem - ber, 
Help me re - mem - ber.
It's Your everlasting grace,
It's Your never failing love,
By the power of Your precious blood
I am changed, I am changed.
And I stand before Your throne,
As one who bears Your name,
Forgiven and redeemed,
And cleansed from all my shame.
And the glory of Your presence,
Is the life You give to me.
I want to remember, Help me remember.

Can the spirit of a mortal
Live beyond the reach of trouble?
Knowing not a painful struggle,
Ever joyful in the Lord? 
Glory to my Savior’s name!
Walking on His holy plane
Nothing can my peace disturb,
Free and happy as a bird,
Singing joyful praise evermore.
He who is our great salvation,
And our high and strong munition
Is to us a full fruition
Of His peace and endless joy.
I no trouble and no sorrow
See today, nor will I borrow
Gloomy visions for the morrow;
In my Jesus all is bright.
To my soul all grace is given,
And all gloom afar is driven,
Walking in the light of heaven,
All is everlasting peace.
Jesus bids be joyful ever;
He Himself, the wondrous Giver,
Flows within a constant river,
And my spirit must rejoice.

“Everlasting life!" is the promise giv’n unto them
Who love the Savior dear.
“Everlasting life!" and a home in Heav’n,
If you will believe His Name.
Then believe Him! O receive Him!
Blessed Savior, kingly favor.
Give Him ever best endeavor,
For with Him is everlasting life!
“Everlasting life!" shout it far and wide,
Blessed tidings of salvation free.
“Everlasting life!" thro’ His blood applied,
To the sinner in his woe.
“Everlasting life!" there is naught to do but to take
The words He gives you now.
“Everlasting life!" precious gift for you,
Thro’ the Savior crucified.

With all my heart I'll say
I'm living for your name
With all to give you praise
I'm living for your glory, Lord
Lost for words with all to say
Lord you take my breath away
Still my soul my soul cries out
For you are holy
And as I look upon your name
Circumstances fade away
Now your glory steals my heart
For you are holy, you are holy
You are holy, Lord
Evermore my heart, my heart will say
Above all, I live for your glory
Even if my world falls I will say
Above all, I live for your glory
adm.in the US & Canada by Integrity's Hosanna! Music

Every breath that I take says I love you,
and every beat of my heart says I'm Yours.
Every step that I take says I need You
and I will bless Your holy name.
You are my Redeemer,
You're the reason that I live.
Yes and You are my Salvation,
and I will bless Your holy name
Every day that goes by shows Your mercy,
and every gift that you give shows You care.
Every song that I sing says You're worthy
and I will bless Your holy name.

Words and Music by Eddie Espinosa

Since I started out to find Thee,
Since I to the cross did flee,
Every bridge is burned behind me;
I will never turn from Thee.
Strengthen all the ties that bind me
Closer, closer, Lord to Thee,
Every bridge is burned behind me;
Thine I evermore will be.
Thou didst hear my plea so kindly;
Thou didst grant me so much grace,
Every bridge is burned behind me;
I will ne’er my steps retrace.
Cares of life perplex and grind me,
Yet I keep the narrow way.
Every bridge is burned behind me;
I from Thee will never stray.
All in All I ever find Thee,
Savior, Lover, Brother, Friend,
Every bridge is burned behind me;
I will serve Thee to the end.

My Savior’s praises I will sing,
And all His love express;
Whose mercies each returning day
Proclaim His faithfulness.
“Every day will I bless Thee!
Every day will I bless Thee!
And I will praise, will praise Thy Name
For ever and ever!"
Redeemed by His almighty power,
My Savior and my King;
My confidence in Him I place,
To Him my soul would cling.
On Thee alone, my Savior, God,
My steadfast hopes depend;
And to Thy holy will my soul
Submissively would bend.
O grant Thy Holy Spirit’s grace,
And aid my feeble powers,
That gladly I may follow Thee
Thro’ all my future hours.

Every hour for Jesus! shall my motto be,
There is plenty of work we may do;
We may all keep busy till the Lord we see,
Till He comes for His faithful few.
Every hour for the Lord,
Every hour for the Lord let us spend;
Every hour for Jesus till He comes again,
When the labor of life shall end.
Every hour for Jesus! We must work and pray,
We should never be slothful or tire;
For the time is coming, so His Word doth say,
When our work shall be tried by fire.
Every hour for Jesus! and whate’er I do,
I must have His approval on me;
If I do heart service with the Lord in view,
He will bless me and keep me free.
Every hour for Jesus! There is work for all,
Spend your time in His service alone;
Be ye ready, waiting for His every call,
Soon He’ll say, “ ’Tis enough, come home.".

Every hour of the passing day
Let me labor, Lord, for Thee;
While one soul in the darkness roams,
Let me never idle be.
Every hour, every day,
Let me do some deed of love;
Every hour, every day,
Point some soul to the world above.
Every hour of the passing day
Let me sow some precious seed;
Lift some load from a fainting soul,
Help some suff’ring one in need.
Every hour of the passing day
Let me breathe Thy name in prayer;
Trusting in Thy grace divine,
Let me in Thy glory share.
Every hour of the passing day
Let me drink at the fountain deep;
Drink from that exhaustless stream
Grace and pow’r my soul to keep.

Every morning mercies new
Fall as fresh as morning dew;
Every morning let us pay
Tribute with the early day:
For Thy mercies, Lord, are sure;
Thy compassion doth endure.
Still the greatness of Thy love
Daily doth our sins remove;
Daily, far as east from west,
Lifts the burden from the breast;
Gives unbought to those who pray
Strength to stand in evil day.
Let our prayers each morn prevail,
That these gifts may never fail;
And, as we confess the sin
And the tempter’s power within,
Every morning, for the strife,
Feed us with the Bread of Life.
As the morning light returns,
As the sun with splendor burns,
Teach us still to turn to Thee,
Ever blessed Trinity,
With our hands our hearts to raise,
In unfailing prayer and praise.

Every morning the red sun
Rises warm and bright;
But the evening cometh on,
And the dark, cold night.
There’s a bright land far away,
Where ’tis never-ending day.
Every spring the sweet young flowers
Open bright and gay,
Till the chilly autumn hours
Wither them away.
There’s a land we have not seen,
Where the trees are always green.
Little birds sing songs of praise
All the summer long,
But in colder, shorter days
They forget their song.
There’s a place where angels sing
Ceaseless praises to their King.
Christ our Lord is ever near
Those who follow Him;
But we cannot see Him here,
For our eyes are dim;
There is a most happy place,
Where men always see His face.
Who shall go to that bright land?
All who do the right:
Holy children there shall stand
In their robes of white;
For that Heav’n, so bright and blest,
Is our everlasting rest.

Every move I make, I make in you
You make me move, Jesus
Every breath I take, I breathe in you
Every step I take, I take in you
You are my way, Jesus
Every breath I take, I breathe in You
Waves of mercy, waves of grace 
Everywhere I look I see your face
Your love has captured me
Oh my God, this love, how can it be?

Everytime I kneel to pray I open up my heart to my Lord
(Everytime I kneel to pray I open up my heart to my Lord)
Everytime I close my eyes I feel the sweet embrace of my Lord
(Everytime I close my eyes I feel the sweet embrace of my Lord)
I don't know why so many things seem to get in the way of seeing my God's glory
But I try everyday to see and thank Him for all the things He's given me
Everytime I see a child I see the gentleness of my Lord
(Everytime I see a child I see the gentleness of my Lord)
Everytime I watch a storm I know the awesome power of my Lord
(Everytime I watch a storm I know the awesome power of my Lord)
I don't know why (I don't know why) so many things seem to get in the way of 
seeing my God's glory (seeing my God's glory)
But I try everyday to see and thank Him for all the things He's given me
Everytime I see a cross!

Up on the mountains my Lord spoke;
Out of His mouth came fire and smoke.
Looked all around me, it looked so fine;
I asked the Lord could it be mine.

Everybody said that anybody could do
The important things somebody should do
Everybody knows that anybody could do
All the good things that nobody did 
Well the preacher came to me and said what I ought to do
If I wanted to make my religion true
He'd do it himself but he really didn't have the time 
He said that the duty was mine 
Well the deacon came by and said give me a hand
If you want to be going to the promised land
Here is something that I don't have time to do
So I better give it to you 
Well I'm too busy so I tell everybody
The work's got to get done by somebody
It could be done by anybody
But nobody, nobody, nobody did

There will come a day
When we will all stand before the throne
On that day, some will say
"Did we not prophesy in your name?"
And they'll say:
"We drove out demons in your name"
I know some will say:
"We performed many miracles in your name"
Some will say
"So many works we've done in your name"
Then the Lord will say:
"Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity
I never knew you"
That's why I know
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord

You may not be a preacher but you sing and shout, 
Whats the use to worry if you've been redeemed 
cause Heavens even better than a miser dreamed.
Think about the trouble you could save some soul, 
Tell them what to do to reach the shining goal, 
surely you can show them how to find the Light, 
make the whole thing right.
When the tribulations seem to darken the way, 
Thats the time to get down on your knees and pray.
Everybody gonna have their troubles too, 
Gotta be so careful bout the things we do.
We're going down the valley, going one by one, 
Gonna be rewarded for the things we've done.
When we get to heaven and the promised land, 
Then we'll understand.
Now get your Holy Bible in the back of the book, 
The book of Revelation thats the place you must look, 
If you understand it and you can if you try, 
Jesus is a comin from His throne on high.
Readin in the Bible all the things that He said, 
Said He was a comin back to raise the dead,

Will you make it through.

Everyone should be quick to listen—hear now and heed—
Slow to speak, also slow to anger in word and deed.
Anger does not yield a life praised by the Lord,
So get rid of all sin and humbly accept God’s Word.
If you listen, but do not practice, you’ll go astray,
Like a man who looks in a mirror, then goes away.
You must keep looking; God’s Word will set you free.
Don’t forget what you’ve heard, but do it, and blessed you’ll be.
If you think you’re a model Christian, yet speak too free,
If your tongue has no rein, faith’s worthless; you’ve been deceived.
Here’s faith the Father accepts as pure and true:
Help the needy, keep from defilement in all you do.

Everything good, everything bright
Everything holy, everything right
Everything worthy, all that I should
And all is well cause I’m gonna dwell on everything good
I’ve got a choice, I’ve got a plan
Gonna find the roses under the thorns whenever I can
I'm lookin’ for joy (lookin' for joy), lookin’ for love (lookin' for love)
Lookin’ for a little bit of heaven on earth shinin’ down from above (from above)
I'm changin’ the scene (changin' the scene), I'm changin’ my ways (changin' my 
ways)
Tradin’ some gloomy doomy nights for a few more sunny days
It’s all in the heart (all in the heart), it’s all in the eyes (all in the eyes)
So here’s how I’m lookin’ at life, I’ve made up my mind
Good, good, good, good
And all is well cause I’m gonna dwell on everything good

If it weren't for you Lord I don't know where I'd be
I could fill the hours but never fill the need
I would still be searching, looking for the truth
But I've found a new life that only comes from you
Everything I do let it be in Your name
Let it be for Your glory let it be for You
Everything I say let it be in Your name 
Let it be to Your glory let it be for Your sake
Cause I wanna please you in everything I do
I want the world to see You when they look at me
and I want the world to hear You in every word I speak
so let my words be Your words and my actions too
So they'll find the new life that I have found in You
You filled up my empty heart
Give me the strength so that I can go on
You're the reason that my life has changed 
And that's why I say.

Jesus loves the little children,
All the children of the world;
Red and yellow, black and white,
They are precious in His sight;
Jesus loves the little children of the world.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way,
Like a starry summer night
or a snow covered winter's day.
Everybody's beautiful in their own way,
Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way.
There is none so blind as he who will not see.
We must not close our minds,
we must let our thoughts be free.
For every hour that passes by,
you know the world gets a little bit older.
It's time to realize that beauty lies
in the eyes of the beholder.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way,
Like a starry summer night
or a snow covered winter's day.
Everybody's beautiful in their own way,
Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way.
We shouldn't care about the length of his hair
or the color of his skin.
Don't worry about what shows from without
but the loves that lives within.
We're gonna get it all together
And everything's gonna work out just fine.
Just take a little time to look on the good side
and straighten it out in your mind.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way,
Like a starry summer night
or a snow covered winter's day.
Everybody's beautiful in their own way,
Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way,
Like a starry summer night
or a snow covered winter's day.
Everybody's beautiful in their own way,
Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way.
Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way.

All right now, all right now, all right now, all right now 
I'm feeling fine today.What else can I say?
I know all along through all the wrong
He's making me strong
When tears are not enough, when life seems too tough
Through the daily grind, if you're one step behind
Just give it some time 
'Cause there is one who loves me
Shown me good living
Constantly serving, Constantly giving 
Everything is gonna be all right
Everything is gonna be all right
Murphy said if it could go wrong it would
I kind of doubt that he was looking for the good
'Cause God said, everything is gonna be all right 
You've got your head held high (head held high)
But you're not sure why
Don't try to pretend, you'll only win
If he's living within
Without the light of day you can't see the way
So why all the pain? You worry in vain
His loss is your gain 
'Cause there is one who loves me
Shown me good living
Constantly serving, constantly giving 
Everything is gonna be all right (yes it is)
Everything is gonna be all right
Just keep in mind that He is working on your heart
Don't tell me you forgot who's been there
From the start
'Cause God said everything is gonna be all right 
He said it's gonna be okay
Just listen close to what He will say
He said it's gonna be okay
He'll lift you up if you kneel down to pray 
(Everything is gonna be all right)
Everything is gonna be all right (all right now, all right now, all right now, 
all right now)
Everything is gonna be all right 

Everything is in your hands
Everything is in your hands
Everything is in your hands, oh God
My past and my present
And things yet to come
My days are in your hands
Each and every one
I know you can handle
Any challenge that I face
You promised you'd be there
Every step that I take
There's nothing too big
That you aren't bigger
Remind us again Lord
That you are in control
We know you can handle
Any challenge that we face
You promised you'd be there
Every step that we take 
(ver.2)
Everything is in Your hands
Everything is in Your hands
Everything is in Your hands, oh God
My past and my present and things yet to come
My days are in Your hands, each and every one
I know You can handle any challenge that I face
You promised You'd be there every step that I take
There's nothing to big, that You aren't bigger
Remind us again Lord that You are in control
We know You can handle any challenge that we face
You promised You'd be there every step that we take

His divine power has given us 
Everything, everything we need 
His divine power has given us 
Everything, everything we need 
For life and godliness 
Through our knowledge of Him 
Who called us 
By His own glory and goodness 
He was given everything for 
Live and godliness 
Through our knowledge of Him 
Who called us 
By His own glory and goodness 
His divine power has given us 
Everything, everything we need

Everything, everything we need 
For life 

Everything's fine when you're taking the time to know Jesus (don't you wanna 
know Him)
Everything's fine when you're taking the time to know (Him) Him
The answers that you did not know (before you loved Him so)
Before you came to love Him so
(All become) All seem to come so clear (all become so clear)
Whenever my Lord is near
Everything's fine when you're taking the time to know Jesus (don't you wanna 
know Him)
Everything's fine when you're taking the time to know (Him) Him
Well, I used to worry and I used to fret
The world would get me so upset
It would make me weary and would make me frown
When it would tug and pull me down
But I was able to rise above
When Jesus pulled me by His love
I've been changed, forgiven, and He's so kind
He makes everything fine
Well, I used to envy and I used to pout
The world had filled me up with doubt
It would make me jealous and would make me sad
When I was giving in to bad
But I was able to overcome
By all that Jesus Christ has done
He's done cleared my conscience and settled my mind
He says everything's fine
Everything's fine when you're taking the time to know Jesus (don't you wanna 
know Him)
Everything's fine when you're taking the time to know (Him) Him
Everything's, everything's, everything's fine
When I am making and taking the time
Everything's, everything's, everything's fine (everything's fine when you're 
taking the time to know)
Everything is fine, yeah

Up on the mountains my Lord spoke;
Out of His mouth came fire and smoke.
Looked all around me, it looked so fine;
I asked the Lord could it be mine.
Every time I feel the spirit
Movin’ in my heart I will pray.
Yes, every time I feel the spirit
Movin’ in my heart I will pray.
There ain’t but one train, running on this track
It runs to heaven and it runs right back
If I behave they will let me ride,
I’ll have a home there when I get inside.
Oh, I have sorrows and I have woe
And I have heartache here below.
But while God leads me I’ll never fear;
For I am sheltered by His care.

Exalt the Lord our God
He is worthy to be praised
Exalt the Lord our God
He is worthy to be praised 
Exalt Him (for He is holy)
Exalt Him (for He is holy)
Exalt Him
And with your voices raised
Exalt Him (for He is holy)
Exalt Him (for He is holy)
Exalt Him
And worthy to be praised 
He's worthy to be praised
He's worthy to be praised 

Exalt the Lord, His praise proclaim;
All ye His servants, praise His Name,
Who in the Lord’s house ever stand
And humbly serve at His command.
The Lord is good, His praise proclaim;
Since it is pleasant, praise His Name;
His people for His own He takes
And His peculiar treasure makes.
I know the Lord is high in state,
Above all gods our Lord is great;
The Lord performs what He decrees,
In heaven and earth, in depths and seas.
He makes the vapors to ascend
In clouds from earth’s remotest end;
The lightnings flash at His command,
He holds the tempest in His hand.
Exalt the Lord, His praise proclaim;
All ye His servants, praise His Name,
Who in the Lord’s house ever stand
And humbly serve at His command,
Forever praise and bless His Name,
And in the church His praise proclaim;
In Zion is His dwelling place;
Praise ye the Lord, show forth His grace.

Exalted high at God’s right hand,
Nearer the throne than cherubs stand,
With glory crowned, in white array,
My wondering soul says, “Who are they?"
These are the saints beloved of God,
Washed are their robes in Jesus’ blood;
More spotless than the purest white,
They shine in uncreated light.
Brighter than angels, lo! they shine
Their glories great, and all divine;
Tell me their origin, and say
Their order what, and whence they came.
Through tribulation great they came;
They bore the cross, and scorned the shame;
Within the living temple blest,
In God they dwell, and on Him rest.
Hunger they ne’er shall feel again,
Nor burning thirst shall they sustain;
To wells of living waters led
By God, the Lamb, forever fed.
Unknown to mortal ears, they sing
The secret glories of their King;
Tell me the subject of their lays,
And whence their loud exalted praise.
Jesus, the Savior, is their theme;
They sing the wonders of His Name;
To Him ascribing power and grace,
Dominion and eternal praise.
“Amen" they cry to Him alone,
Who dares to fill His Father’s throne;
They give Him glory, and again

I want to multiply what I have
To do more than what is required
To walk the extra mile
Then God will say to me
Worthy and profitable servant
Excellent spirit
Excellent work
To rise above the rest
Excellent servant
Excellent mind
Is what I’m longing for

Excuses, Excuses
You hear them everyday
Now the devil he'll supply them if in church you stay away
When people come to worship God, the devil always loses
So to keep those folks away from church, he offers them excuses 
Well in the summer it's too hot
In the winter it's too cold
In the springtime when the weather's just right, you find some place else to go
Well it's up to the mountains or down to the beach or to visit some old friend
Or just stay home and kind relax and hope some of the kid folks start droppin' 
in
Well those church benches; they're too hard
And that song leader's way too loud
Well you know how nervous you get when you're sittin' in a great big crowd
Now the doctor told you to watch them crowds, they'll set you back
But you go to that ol' ball game 'cause they say it helps you to relax
Well a headache Sunday morning
And a backache Sunday night
But by work time Monday morning, you're feeling quite all right
Well one of the children has a cold, pneumonia do you suppose?
Why, the whole family has to stay home! (Just to blow that poor kid's nose) 
To keep those folks away from church, he offers them excuses! 

We’ve come into your house 
With hearts wide open
We’ve come to you 
Expecting to see your power (x2)
You are my God
I will seek you 
My soul longs for you
Oh Lord, You know me
Better than I know myself
Oh Lord, I trust You
My heart is Yours

Extended on a cursed tree,
Besmeared with dust, and sweat, and blood,
See there, the King of Glory see!
Sinks and expires the Son of God.
Who, who, my Savior, this hath done?
Who could Thy sacred body wound?
No guilt Thy spotless heart hath known,
No guile hath in Thy lips been found.
I, I alone, have done the deed!
’Tis I Thy sacred flesh have torn;
My sins have caused Thee, Lord, to bleed,
Pointed the nail, and fixed the thorn.
The burden, for me to sustain
Too great, on Thee, my Lord, was laid;
To heal me, Thou hast borne my pain;
To bless me, Thou a curse wast made.
In the devouring lion’s teeth,
Torn, and forsook of all, I lay;
Thou sprang’st into the jaws of death,
From death to save the helpless prey.
Savior, how shall I proclaim?
How pay the mighty debt I owe?
Let all I have, and all I am,
Ceaseless to all Thy glory show.
Too much to Thee I cannot give;
Too much I cannot do for Thee;
Let all Thy love, and all Thy grief,
Graven on my heart for ever be!
The meek, the still, the lowly mind,
O may I learn from Thee, my God,
And love, with softest pity joined,
For those that trample on Thy blood!
Still let Thy tears, Thy groans, Thy sighs,
O’erflow my eyes, and heave my breast,
Till loose from flesh and earth I rise,
And ever in Thy bosom rest.

Let everything that, everything that
everything that has breath praise the Lord
(repeat)
Praise you in the morning 
Praise you in the evening
Praise you when I'm young and when I'm old
Praise you when I'm laughing
Praise you when I'm grieving
Praise you every season of your soul
If we could see how much your worth
Your power your might your endless love
Then surely we would never cease to praise you
Praise you when the heavens, joining with the angels
Praising you forever and a day
Praise you on the earth now, joining with creation
Calling all the nations to your praise
If they could see how much your worth
Your power your might your endless love
Then surely they would never cease to praise you

The earth and the fullness with which it is stored,
The world and its dwellers belong to the Lord;
For He on the seas its foundations has laid,
And firm on the waters its pillars has stayed.
What man shall the hill of Jehovah ascend,
And who in the place of His presence attend?
The man of pure heart and of hands without stain,
Who swears not to falsehood nor loves what is vain.
That man ever blest of Jehovah shall live,
The God of salvation shall righteousness give;
For this is the people, yea, this is the race,
The Israel true that is seeking His face.

The earth belongs unto the Lord,
And all that it contains;
The world that is inhabited,
And all that there remains.
For the foundations thereof
He on the seas did lay,
And He hath it established
Upon the floods to stay.
Who is the man that shall ascend
Into the hill of God?
Or who within His holy place
Shall have a firm abode?
Whose hands are clean, whose heart is pure,
And into vanity
Who hath not lifted up his soul,
Nor sworn deceitfully.
He from th’Eternal shall receive
The blessing him upon,
And righteousness, ev’n from the God
Of his salvation.
This is the generation
That after Him inquire,
O Jacob, who do seek Thy face
With their whole heart’s desire.
Ye gates, lift up your heads on high;
Ye doors, that last for aye,
Be lifted up, that so the King
Of glory enter may.
But who of glory is the King?
The mighty Lord is this;
Ev’n that same Lord, that great in might
And strong in battle is.

The earth is hushed in silence,
Its cares now flee away,
Let all things bow in reverence,
On this the Lord’s own day.
O praise and pray on this,
The Lord’s own day.
The bells are sweetly ringing,
Their clear toned voices say:
“Ye people, come and worship
On this, the Lord’s own day."
Come, all ye thankful people;
Why should our hearts delay
To greet the Lord of Heaven
On this His holy day?

The earth was filled with peace and light,
When Christ arose;
The heavens trembled at the sight,
When Christ arose;
The sea rejoiced along the sands,
The vernal valleys clapped their hands,
The mountains sang, and all the lands,
When Christ arose.
The tomb was empty where He lay,
When Christ arose;
And angels rolled the stone away,
When Christ arose;
A sound of triumph thrilled the air,
The glorious tidings to declare,
And there was gladness ev’rywhere,
When Christ arose.
The soul of man was born anew,
When Christ arose;
The cross divine appeared in view,
When Christ arose;
A glorious light from heaven streamed,
And from the cross a radiance beamed,
For ev’ry spirit was redeemed,
When Christ arose.

The earth, O Lord, is one wide field
Of all Thy chosen seed;
The crop prepared its fruit to yield;
The laborers are few indeed.
We therefore come before Thee now
With fasting, and with prayer,
Beseeching of Thy love that Thou
Wouldst send more laborers there.
Not for our land alone we pray,
Though that above the rest;
The realms and islands far away,
O let them all be blest.
Endue the bishops of Thy flock
With wisdom and with grace,
Against false doctrine, like a rock,
To set the heart and face.
To all Thy priests Thy truth reveal,
And make Thy judgments clear;
Make Thou Thy deacons full of zeal,
And humble, and sincere.
And give their flocks a lowly mind
To hear and to obey;
That each and all may mercy find
At Thine appearing day.

The earth, with all that dwell therein,
With all its wealth untold,
Belongs to God, Who founded it
Upon the seas of old.
What man shall stand before the Lord
On Zion’s holy hill?
The clean of hand, the pure of heart,
The just who does His will.
Lo, such are they that seek for God
And blest by Him they live
To them His perfect righteousness
The God of grace will give.
Who is this glorious King that comes?
To claim His sovereign right?
It is the Lord omnipotent
All conquering in His might.
Ye everlasting doors, give way,
Lift up your heads, ye gates!
For now, behold, to enter in
The King of Glory waits.
Who is this glorious King that comes
To claim His rightful throne?
The Lord of Hosts, He is the King
Of glory, God alone.

I will meet you in the morning,
Just inside the Eastern Gate.
Then be ready, faithful pilgrim,
Lest with you it be too late.
I will meet you, I will meet you
Just inside the Eastern Gate over there.
I will meet you, I will meet you,
I will meet you in the morning over there.
If you hasten off to glory,
Linger near the Eastern Gate,
For I’m coming in the morning;
So you’ll not have long to wait.
Keep your lamps all trimmed and burning;
For the Bridegroom watch and wait.
He’ll be with us at the meeting
Just inside the Eastern Gate.
O the joys of that glad meeting
With the saints who for us wait!
What a blessed, happy meeting
Just inside the Eastern Gate!

We shall meet in the Eden above,
In that beautiful land of the blest;
All our trials and pains will be o’er,
When we enter that mansion of rest.
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
All our trials and pains will be o’er,
When we enter that mansion of rest.
When we meet in the Eden above,
When we enter that blissful abode,
All the good who have passed on before,
We shall meet in the City of God.
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
All the good who have passed on before,
We shall meet in the City of God.
The saints of all ages are there,
The prophets and martyrs of old;
The children whose voices on earth are still,
Now sing in that city of gold.
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
The children whose voices on earth are still,
Now sing in that city of gold.

I have tried to count His blessings, and I fail to understand
Why the Lord should so richly reward;
Could I count the stars of heaven, add to them earth’s grains of sand,
Still His blessings are more, praise the Lord!
And the end is not yet, praise the Lord,
And the end is not yet, praise the Lord;
Blessings new He’s still bestowing,
And my cup is overflowing,
And the end is not yet, praise the Lord!
Like an army I behold them pass before me in review,
O what joy doth the sight now afford!
Tho’ they may be long in passing, still they come, battalions new,
And the end is not yet, praise the Lord!
Surely goodness, love and mercy have been mine along life’s way,
And my weak heart to strength is restored;
And my cup of joy and gladness keeps o’erflowing, day by day,
And the end is not yet, praise the Lord!

When I come to the end of the long, long road,
The shadows will flee away,
And I’ll stand in the glorious light of God,
Where dwelleth eternal day.
When I come to the end, the end of the road,
To the land of eternity,
When I come to the end of life’s long road,
The face of my Lord I’ll see.
Looking back o’er the years that were hard and drear,
The hand of the Christ I’ll see;
While my heart will go forth with a song of praise,
Because of His love for me.
When I come to the end of the long, long road,
And trials will all be past,
I shall look in the face of my dearest Friend,
Safe home in His Heav’n at last.

The ends of all the earth shall hear
And turn unto the Lord in fear;
All kindreds of the earth shall own
And worship Him as God alone.
All earth to Him her homage brings,
The Lord of lords, the King of kings.
For His the kingdom, His of right,
He rules the nations by His might;
All earth to Him her homage brings,
The Lord of lords, the King of kings.
Both rich and poor, both bond and free
Shall worship Him on bended knee,
And children’s children shall proclaim
The glorious honor of His Name.
The Lord’s unfailing righteousness
All generations shall confess,
From age to age shall all be taught
What wondrous works the Lord has wrought.

The eternal gifts of Christ the King,
The Apostles’ glorious deeds, we sing;
And while due hymns of praise we pay,
Our thankful hearts cast grief away.
The Church in these her princes boasts,
These victor chiefs of warriors hosts;
The soldiers of the heavenly hall,
The lights that rose on earth for all.
’Twas thus the yearning faith of saints,
The unconquered hope that never faints,
The love of Christ that knows not shame,
The prince of this world overcame.
In these the Father’s glory shone;
In these the will of God the Son;
In these exults the Holy Ghost;
Through these rejoice the heavenly host.
Redeemer, hear us of Thy love,
That, with this glorious band above,
Hereafter, of Thine endless grace,
Thy servants also may have place.

Holy, holy, holy;
Angel voices singing;
Holy, holy, holy,
Through high heaven ringing.
From that temple, pure and bright,
Bathed in streams of crystal light,
Hear the everlasting hymn,
Holy, holy, holy.

A few more marchings weary, then we'll gather home!
A few more storm clouds dreary, then we'll gather home!
A few more days the cross to bear,
And then with Christ a crown to wear;
A few more marchings weary, then we'll gather home!

A few more marchings weary, then we'll gather home!
A few more storm clouds dreary, then we'll gather home!
A few more days the cross to bear,
And then with Christ a crown to wear;
A few more marchings weary, then we'll gather home!
O弾r time's rapid river, soon we'll rest forever;
No more marchings weary when we gather home!
A few more nights of weeping, then we'll gather home!
A few more watches keeping, then we'll gather home!
A few more vict池ies over sin,
A few more sheaves to gather in,
A few more marchings weary, then we'll gather home!
A few more sweet links broken, then we'll gather home!
A few more kind words spoken, then we'll gather home!
A few more partings on the strand,
And then away to Canaan's land:
A few more marchings weary, then we'll gather home!

A friend I have called Jesus, Whose love is strong and true,
And never fails howe’er ’tis tried, no matter what I do;
I’ve sinned against this love of His, but when I knelt to pray,
Confessing all my guilt to Him, the sin clouds rolled away.
It’s just like Jesus to roll the clouds away,
it’s just like Jesus to keep me day by day,
it’s just like Jesus all along the way,
It’s just like His great love.
Sometimes the clouds of trouble bedim the sky above,
I cannot see my Savior’s face, I doubt His wondrous love;
But He, from heaven’s mercy seat, beholding my despair,
In pity bursts the clouds between, and shows me He is there.
When sorrow’s clouds o’ertake me, and break upon my head,
When life seems worse than useless, and I were better dead;
I take my grief to Jesus then, nor do I go in vain,
For heavenly hope He gives that cheers like sunshine after rain.
O, I could sing forever of Jesus’ love divine,
Of all His care and tenderness for this poor life of mine;
His love is in and over all, and wind and waves obey,
When Jesus whispers “Peace, be still!" and rolls the clouds away.

Face to face with Christ, my Savior,
Face to face—what will it be,
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ Who died for me?
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
Only faintly now I see Him,
With the darkened veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.
What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain.
Face to face—oh, blissful moment!
Face to face—to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ Who loves me so.

Fade, fade, each earthly joy, Jesus is mine!
Break every tender tie, Jesus is mine!
Dark is the wilderness, Earth has no resting place,
Jesus alone can bless, Jesus is mine!
Tempt not my soul away, Jesus is mine!
Here would I ever stay, Jesus is mine!
Perishing things of clay, born but for one brief day,
Pass from my heart away, Jesus is mine!
Farewell, ye dreams of night, Jesus is mine!
Lost in this dawning bright, Jesus is mine!
All that my soul has tried left but a dismal void;
Jesus has satisfied, Jesus is mine!
Farewell, mortality, Jesus is mine!
Welcome, eternity, Jesus is mine!
Welcome, oh, loved and blest, welcome sweet scenes of rest,
Welcome, my Savior’s breast, Jesus is mine!

Fain would I, Lord of grace,
With penitential tears
The record of my sins efface,
That in Thy book appears:
Fain would I journey hence,
In garb of stainless white,
And made by mine own penitence
Well pleasing in Thy sight.
Fond idle dream! the foe
But lures and fools my soul;
Not all my tears can peace bestow—
Thou only makest whole.
Hath ever sailor tossed,
Or sufferer racked in pain,
Within Thine anchorage been lost,
Or found Thy Gilead vain?
Maker and Hope of all!
Wounded and sick am I:
Great Healer, save me, lest I fall
And perish utterly.
Can boundless love reject?
Shall mercy say me nay,
Who cry with all Thine own elect
Before Thee, night and day?

Faint falls the gentle voice of prayer,
In the wild sounds that fill the air,
Yet, Lord, we know that voice is heard,
Not less than if Thy throne it stirred.
Thine ear, Thou tender One, is caught,
If we but bend the knee in thought;
No choral song that shakes the sky
Floats farther than the Christian’s sigh.
Not all the darkness of the land
Can hide the lifted eye and hand;
Nor need the clanging conflict cease,
To make Thee hear our cries for peace.

Faintly you surround me
Faintly you surround me
Faintly you surround me
And I feel your touch, And I feel your touch
The wind in the trees softly whispers
Wind in the trees softly whispers
Wind in the trees softly whispers
And I hear your voice, And I hear your voice
And I worship you, oh Lord, my God
And I worship you, oh Lord, my God
And I worship you, oh Lord, my God

Fair waved the golden corn,
In Canaan’s pleasant land,
When full of joy, some shining morn,
Went forth the reaper band.
To God so good and great
Their cheerful thanks they pour;
Then carry to His temple gate
The choicest of their store.
Like Israel, Lord, we give
Our earliest fruits to Thee,
And pray that, long as we shall live,
We may Thy children be.
Thine is our youthful prime,
And life and all its powers,
Be with us in our morning time,
And bless our evening hours.
In wisdom let us grow,
As years and strength are given,
That we may serve Thy Church below,
And join Thy saints in Heaven.

Fairweather friends, fairweather sailors,
Will leave you stranded on life’s shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures.
We never know which way the wind will blow,
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be.
But He’s a solid rock when troubles grow,
And He’s holding out a saving hand for me.
He’ll be a refuge in the storm;
He’ll be a beacon in the night;
In the chilly winds of doubt He’ll keep you warm;
When you can’t find your way He’ll be your ligh.

O beautiful Zion, fair bride of the Lamb,
Thy marvelous light we behold,
Which shone on the nations enshrouded by darkness,
And millions were brought to thy fold.
O Zion, fair Zion, thou church of the firstborn,
My heart in its rapture rejoices in thee;
The angels in heaven behold thee with wonder,
Thou glorious city, thou home of the free.
Eclipsed was thy luster by long papal night,
And dimly the dark cloudy day
Revealed thee to eyes that were earnestly searching
For truth and the heavenly way.
Thy light as the morning breaks forth in the earth,
Thy brightness all nations shall see;
The ransomed from Babel are eagerly turning
With songs of rejoicing to thee.
O Zion, blest Zion, thy sun shall no more
Go down in obscurity’s night;
From out thy perfection of beauty is shining
The rays of God’s wonderful light.
Eternity’s ages of bliss shall be thine,
In regions unclouded above;
And there shalt thou dwell evermore with thy Maker,
Delighting thyself in His love.

Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,
O Thou of God and man the Son,
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,
Thou, my soul’s glory, joy and crown.
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.
Fair is the sunshine,
Fairer still the moonlight,
And all the twinkling starry host;
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels heaven can boast.
All fairest beauty, heavenly and earthly,
Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;
None can be nearer, fairer or dearer,
Than Thou, my Savior, art to me.
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations!
Son of God and Son of Man!
Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
Now and forever more be Thine.

Fairest of all the earth beside,
Chiefest of all unto Thy bride,
Fullness divine in Thee I see,
Beautiful Man of Calvary!
That Man of Calvary
Has won my heart from me,
And died to set me free,
Blest Man of Calvary!
Granting the sinner life and peace,
Granting the captive sweet release,
Shedding His blood to make us free,
Merciful Man of Calvary!
Giving the gifts obtained for men,
Pouring out love beyond our ken,
Giving us spotless purity,
Bountiful Man of Calvary!
Comfort of all my earthly way,
Jesus I’ll meet Thee some sweet day;
Center of glory Thee I’ll see,
Wonderful Man of Calvary!

Do you see in the distance yonder,
That line drawn up in array?
’Tis the host of the Loyal Leaguers,
Come forth to the conquest day.
They follow the bloodstained banner,
And the path that their Master trod,
For their sign is the cross of Calv’ry,
And their sword is the Word of God.
Victory, we’ll sing of victory,
For Christ hath promised us the victory;
Victory, we’ll sing of victory,
Faith brings the victory.
They are marching away to conquest
That shall never know a defeat,
For the Christ hath assured all vict’ry
Who are faithful and scorn retreat.
Then join this advancing army,
And look to the throne above,
Lift the form of thy fallen brother,
And point to the God of love.

Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Hide not Thy face from me;
Sick and faint, as the leper came,
Jesus, I come to Thee.
Thou canst remove the plague of sin,
Washing my inmost soul;
Jesus, I come with breaking heart,
Help me and make me whole.
Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Speak, and my soul shall live;
O my faith will not let Thee go
Till Thou my sin forgive.
Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Weary and sad am I;
Bending low at Thy sacred feet,
Hear my repentant cry;
Faith in Thy Word has led me here,
Faith cannot plead in vain;
Lord, I believe; O cleanse me now,
Wash me from every stain.
Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Lord, I am pleading still;
Now I hear from Thy lips divine,
“Child, thou hast faith—I will";
Joy to my soul, great joy has come,
Mourning and tears are o’er;
Sweet are Thy words of love to me,
“Go thou, and sin no more."

If asked whereon I rest my claim
To full salvation’s joy,
If nothing more I need to name,
Or other words employ,
Besides our Savior’s blood and wounds,
To me all-satisfying grounds;
I answer then, “My claim is good!
’Tis based on Jesus’ blood."
This is my hope’s foundation firm,
Which ever shall endure;
Yea, at the end of life’s brief term,
I’ll rest thereon secure,
And dreaded death shall lose its sting,
As of my Savior’s wounds I sing;
His precious blood shall be the key
That opens Heav’n for me.

God says whosoever believes on His Son,
Has pardon obtained and a new life begun;
His sins blotted out, not by aught he has done,
But thro’ faith in the Word of God!
His Word is a strong eternal rock,
Unshaken it stands thro’ fiercest shock;
Though Satan and all his hosts may mock,
I have faith in the Word of God!
And God will make righteous and cleanse from all sin
The one who the chiefest of sinners has been;
He sanctifies wholly and justifies him
Who has faith in the Word of God!
O soul without God, without hope, without peace,
Just now come to Him, let your doubtings all cease;
He says He’ll receive you, your joys will increase,
O have faith in the Word of God.

Faith is a living power from Heaven
That grasps the promise God hath given,
A trust that cannot be o’erthrown,
Fixed heartily on Christ alone.
Faith finds in Christ whate’er we need
To save or strengthen us indeed,
Receives the grace He sends us down,
And makes us share His cross and crown.
Faith in the conscience worketh peace,
And bids the mourner’s weeping cease;
By faith the children’s place we claim,
And give all honor to one Name.
Faith feels the Spirit’s kindling breath
In love and hope that conquer death;
Faith worketh hourly joy in God,
And trusts and blesses e’en the rod.
We thank Thee then, O God of Heaven,
That Thou to us this faith hast given
In Jesus Christ Thy Son, Who is
Our only fount and source of bliss.
And from His fullness grant each soul
The rightful faith’s true end and goal,
The blessedness no foes destroy,
Eternal love and light and joy.

Faith is believing, the promise is true,
Trusting in Jesus your strength to renew;
Resting so sweetly, secure on His word,
Shielded from danger with Jesus the Lord.
Faith is believing, simply receiving
What in His promise God has revealed;
Trust Him forever, doubt Him, no, never,
Till thy petition His Spirit hath sealed.
Faith is believing, why longer remain
Under the bondage of Satan’s domain?
See, though all blood-stained, the banner unfurled—
Faith is the victory that conquers the world.
Faith is believing, the soul’s happy rest,
Faith is believing, though sorely oppressed;
Singing in triumph whatever assail,
High on the mountains or low in the vale.
Faith is believing, then doubt Him no more,
Sell all your sorrows, your troubles give o’er;
Soar in the sunlight above every cloud,
Triumph forever, believing in God.

Faith is the Spirit's evidence,
A witness to the soul;
It claims no merits in itself,
But comes to Christ for all.
Its substance is the Lord of life,
The Christian is its home;
It leads the soul to full supplies,
And points out joys to come.
It claims in Christ a legacy,
And helps the child to see;
This faith, dear Saviour, is thy gift,
O give this faith to me.

Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers, rise.
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies.
Against the foe in vales below
Let all our strength be hurled.
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world.
Faith is the victory! Faith is the victory!
O glorious victory, that overcomes the world.
His banner over us is love,
Our sword the Word of God.
We tread the road the saints above
With shouts of triumph trod.
By faith, they like a whirlwind’s breath,
Swept on o’er every field.
The faith by which they conquered death
Is still our shining shield.
On every hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array.
Let tents of ease be left behind,
And onward to the fray.
Salvation’s helmet on each head,
With truth all girt about,
The earth shall tremble ’neath our tread,
And echo with our shout.
To him that overcomes the foe,
White raiment shall be giv’n.
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in Heav’n.
Then onward from the hill of light,
Our hearts with love aflame,
We’ll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus’ conqu’ring Name.

Faith means we’re sure of what we hope to get;
We’re certain of the things that we do not see.
By faith we know that God made the world;
What’s here now was not made from what was seen.
Abel by faith offered God a better sacrifice;
And Enoch, too, by faith died not, but from this life did rise.
Though they are gone, they speak this word:
That without faith, none can please the Lord.
It was by faith that Noah built the ark,
When warned by God of things that were yet to pass.
Since he had faith, God did spare his life,
And made him an heir of His righteousness.
Abraham, too, when God said to leave his home behind,
Obeyed and went, though he knew not the land he was to find.
Though they are gone, they speak this word:
That without faith, none can please the Lord.
It was by faith that Abr’ham had a son,
Then offered him to God as a sacrifice.
Faith upheld Moses in Egypt’s land,
And faith let a lamb pay the firstborn’s price.
By faith the people passed through the sea as on dry land,
And faith was why the walls of Jericho just could not stand.
Though they are gone, they speak this word:
That without faith, none can please the Lord.
All these still lived by faith until they died,
Receiving not the things that had been made known.
They only saw them as from afar;
They knew that their country was not their own.
God therefore was not ashamed to be named as their Lord;
For they believed that He was real and would their faith reward.
Oh, give me faith to trust Your Word,
That by my life I may please You, Lord.

Words: Kody King and Jonny Williams 
Give me your strength
Give me your truth
Give me a faith of my own
Give me your strength
Give me your truth
Give me a faith of my own
When I was a boy not so long ago
I believed in You, but the faith was not my own
I know You’re by my side, but now I feel alone
Lost in this world where I’ve been thrown
I am not a child, I strive to be the man
Where faith is not just what I believe, it’s who I am
Help me to look on high, help me to take a stand
Lead me down the path to find your plan
I need a faith of my own
What now?
Would you think that I’m grown up now?
Would you think that I’ve blown up now?
After what He has shown us
How could you think it would last?
Think it would not be a flash in the pan?
Think you would not need to ask of the Man?
Take a lasting grasp of His hand
So I’m wondering
How could He see in me?
How could His spirit be in me?
How could He use me just to see
That I need to be in His presence to truly see
That His message seeps into me
It holds fast, a slash through the heart of me?
My faith has got to last
And blast way past the place where I used to be
Strugglin’ with the faith I’ve been given
Confusin’ fantasy with the life I’ve been livin’
How can my faith be truly blessed
Unless it’s been tested and perfected
Give me a way to see
The chosen path You’ve laid before me
Give me the strength to lean on You
No matter where I’ve been or what I’ve been through
Faith (give me a faith)
That’s truly grown (I need a faith)
Faith
That I can just call my own
Bring me back to the place and the path and the life to me
That You’ve truly shown
Now I am not a child, I strive to be the man
Where faith is not just what I believe, it’s who I am

Faith of our brothers, suffering sore,
Enduring prison, famine, and sword,
O Holy Spirit, give comfort, we pray,
May they this day find strength in Thy Word.
Faith of our brothers, holy faith,
May they be true to thee till death!
Tortured and killed for Thy dear Name,
Lord, give them grace to count all but loss,
May they hold steadfast to the end,
Sharing the sufferings of the cross.
Faith of our brothers, holy faith,
May they be true to thee till death!
Our brothers, chained in prisons dark,
Are still in heart and conscience free,
O may they know thy deep, sweet peace,
Fill them with joy for all to see.
Faith of our brothers, holy faith,
May they be true to thee till death!
Faith of our brothers! May they love
Both friend and foe in all their strife,
And preach Thee too, as love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life.
Faith of our brothers, holy faith,
May they be true to thee till death!
And Lord, may we be ready too,
To give our lives, if needed, for Thee,
May we be strong in Thy great strength,
And live each day, committed to Thee.
Faith of all brothers, holy faith,
May we be true to thee till death!

Faith of our fathers, living still,
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Whenever we hear that glorious Word!
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
Faith of our fathers, we will strive
To win all nations unto Thee;
And through the truth that comes from God,
We all shall then be truly free.
Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.

Faith of our mothers, living still
In cradle song and bedtime prayer;
In nursery lore and fireside love,
Thy presence still pervades the air:
Faith of our mothers, living faith!
We will be true to thee to death.
Faith of our mothers, loving faith,
Fount of our childhood's trust and grace,
Oh, may thy consercration prove
Source of a finer, nobler race:
Faith of our mothers, living faith,
We will be true to thee till death.
Faith of our mothers, guiding faith,
For youthful longing, youthful doubt,
How blurred our vision, blind our way,
Thy providential care without:
Faith of our mothers, guiding faith,
We will be true to thee till death.
Faith of our mothers, Christian faith,
Is truth beyond our stumbling creeds,
Still serve the home and save the Church,
And breathe thy spirit through our deeds:
Faith of our mothers, Christian faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

If thou wilt know the fountain deep,
Of sweet unbroken rest;
The rest of faith thy soul shall keep,
He that believes is ever blest.
Put on thy strength, O Zion, rise,
And fix thy trust above the skies;
Move out on faith’s almighty plane,
Through Him that loved us dare to reign.
The gift of faith no limit knows,
Save God’s unbounded Word;
It triumphs o’er its giant foes,
And glorifies the blessed Lord.
Stay not in feeble unbelief,
When God commands be strong;
Be strong in Him, the Word believe,
And shout the overcomer’s song.
I can do all in Jesus’ name,
Thus sings the faith of God;
It sings and hills of trouble flee,
It rides triumphant on the flood.

Lord, You're faithful and just
In You I put my trust, Mighty God
Everlasting Father
Your Word is faithful and true
What You promised to do
Oh Lord, Your Word endures forever
You're faithful, faithful
And Your mercy never ends
The world will pass away
But Your words are here to stay
You're wonderful, counselor, Mighty God
Lord Jehovah, You are the great I AM.

Faithful and true
We lead ye forth
Where love triumphant
Shall crown ye with joy
Star of renown
Flower of the earth
Blessed be ye both
Far from all life's annoy
Champion victorious
Go thou before
Maid bright and glorious
Go thou before
Earth's noisy revel
Ye have forsaken
Tender delight for you now awaken
Fragrant abode
Enshrine ye in bliss
Splendor and state
In joy ye dismiss
Faithful and true
We lead ye forth
Where love triumphant
Shall crown ye with joy
Star of renown
Flower of the earth
Blessed be ye both
Far from all life's annoy 

Words and Music by Brian Doerksen
Father, I can't explain this kind of love
This kind of grace
I know I still break Your heart
And yet You run to welcome me
This is my song of praise to You
For who You are and all that You do
From the moment my life began
You have been faithful
Father I love the way you hold me close
And say my name
I know when my life is through
My heart will find its home in You
This is my song of praise to You
For who You are and all that You do
From the moment my life began
You have been faithful
You will be faithful
Forever faithful
Father
This is our song of praise to You
For who You are and all that You do
From before the world began
You have been faithful (You will be faithful
Forever faithful
Father

Faithful One, so unchanging
Ageless one, you're my Rock of Peace.
Lord of all, I depend on You,
I call out to you, 
again and again
I call out to you, 
again and again
You are my rock in times of trouble,
You lift me up when I fall down;
all through the storm,
Your love is the anchor,
my hope is in You alone.

Faithful Shepherd, feed me
In the pastures green;
Faithful Shepherd, lead me
Where Thy steps are seen.
Hold me fast, and guide me
In the narrow way;
So, with Thee beside me,
I shall never stray.
Daily bring me nearer
To the heav’nly shore;
Make my faith grow clearer,
May I love Thee more.
Hallow every pleasure,
Every gift and pain;
Be Thyself my treasure,
Though none else I gain.
Day by day prepare me
As Thou seest best,
Then let angels bear me
To Thy promised rest.

Faithful, faithful to the end
Holding on to the Savior’s hand
Comes a time you must take a stand
So be faithful, faithful to the end
By faith a baby takes a step
Though falling causes pain
Practice making permanent
This painful walking game (this painful walking game)
So be.
I stumble like a child at times
And getting up’s so very tough
But falling brings me to my knees
And I’m not there near enough (not there near enough)
So be.
The trials come upon us
We stand the test of time
We run or will we falter
Our faith’s the bottom line (our faith's the bottom line)
So be.
Christ will dwell in your heart
If you have the faith
If you have the faith (sure of hope what we hope for, certain of what we don't 
see)
So be.

Faithful vigil ended,
watching, waiting cease;
Master, grant your servant
his discharge in peace.
All the Spirit promised,
all the Father willed,
now these eyes behold it
perfectly fulfilled.
This your great deliverance
sets your people free;
Christ their light uplifted
all the nations see.
Christ, your people's glory!
Watching, doubting cease:
grant to us your servants
our discharge in peace.

We are children of the Father (faithfully)
Followers of Jesus Christ (faithfully)
Daily walking in His Spirit
And we will praise the Lord faithfully
And we will serve the Lord faithfully
And we will love the Lord and His people
Faithfully (always loving faithfully) 
We are children of the Father (faithfully)
Followers of Jesus Christ (faithfully)
Daily walking in His Spirit
And we will praise the Lord faithfully
And we will serve the Lord faithfully
And we will love the Lord and His people
Faithfully 

Fall on me
Every so gently
Breathe on, breathe on these dry bones
Shower me
In Your love
Washing, washing my filthy stains
My filthy stains
And break these chains
And break these chains
Set me free
Set me free

On this cold November morning here I stand
By the graveside of this dear forgotten man
Thinking of the friends he lost for love of gold
This old story through the years has oft been told.
Some folks drift along through life and never thrill
To the feeling that a good deed brings, until
It's too late but they're ready to lie down
There beneath the leaves that are scattered on the ground.
Fallen leaves that lie scattered on the ground
The birds and flowers that were here cannot be found
All the friends we ever had are not around
They are scattered like the leaves upon the ground.
Lord let my eyes see every need of every man
Make me stop and always lend a helping hand
Then when I'm laid beneath my little grassy mound
There'll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground.
To your grave there's no use taking any gold
You cannot use it when it's time for hands to fold
When you leave this earth for a better home someday
The only things you'll take are what you gave away.
Fallen leaves that lie scattered on the ground
The birds and flowers that were here cannot be found
All the friends we ever had are not around
They are scattered like the leaves upon the ground.

(with echo):
Fallen walls and open doors
We are not bound anymore
We must follow when He calls
Through open doors and fallen walls
Lord give me the courage to listen when You're speaking (when You're speaking)
So I can be ready (so I can be ready) to practice what I'm preaching
The world is changing (changing, changing, the world is changing) in ways that 
we've been hoping
The walls are falling (falling, falling), and doors keep flying open
The people are searching (searchin', searchin'), and willing to take chances
We've got to be serving (we've got to be serving), it's time to take advances 
(we're making advances)
The need is urgent and time is of the essence
Let's take them the Gospel (we'll take 'em the Gospel) so they can know His 
presence (presence, they can know His presence)
Fallen walls.

By the grave site of this near forgotten man 
On this cold November morning here I stand 
Thinking of the friends he lost for the love of gold 
This story through the years has often been told 
Falling leaves that lie scattered on the ground,
The birds and flowers that were here cannot be found.
All the friends that he once knew are not around.
They're all scattered like the leaves upon the ground.
Some folks drift along through life and never thrill,
To the feeling that a good deed brings until,
It's too late and they are ready to lie down,
There beneath the leaves that's scattered on the ground.
Lord, let my eyes see every need of every man,
Make me stop and always lend a helping hand,
Then when I'm laid beneath that little grassy mound,
There'll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground.
To your grave there's no use taking any gold,
You cannot use it when it's time for hands to fold,
When you leave this earth for a better home someday,
The only thing you'll take is what you gave away

Falter not nor look behind thee,
Cast thy every weight aside;
Haste to win the prize before thee,
Trusting Him, thy precious Guide.
Falter not, nor look behind thee,
Still thy course with joy pursue;
Persevere, for thou must conquer,
With the cross of Christ in view.
Falter not nor look behind thee,
Firm and fearless take thy place;
Robe and crown and palm are waiting
For the victors in the race.
Falter not nor look behind thee,
Lest thy labor prove in vain;
Run with patience, and remember
Thou hast much to lose or gain.
Falter not nor look behind thee,
Lo, the prize is just in sight;
One more struggle, meet it bravely,
Speed thee on with all thy might.
Falter not nor look behind thee,
What of all thy trials past,
If by grace through faith in Jesus,
Thine the victor’s crown at last?

There's A Fam'ly Bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But The Fam'ly Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memo- ries.
At the close of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from The Fam'ly Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one.
I can see us sittin' 'round the table
When from The Fam'ly Bible Dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
I can hear my mama softly singing
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me.
This old world of ours is full of troubles
But this world would oh, so better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the table
And mothers singing Rock of Ages cleft for me.

I'm so glad I'm a part of the Family of God,
I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by His blood!
Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod,
For I'm part of the family,
The Family of God.
You will notice we say "brother and sister" 'round here,
It's because we're a family and these are so near;
When one has a heartache, we all share the tears,
And rejoice in each victory in this family so dear.
I'm so glad I'm a part of the Family of God,
I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by His blood!
Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod,
For I'm part of the family,
The Family of God.
From the door of an orphanage to the house of the King,
No longer an outcast, a new song I sing;
From rags unto riches, from the weak to the strong,
I'm not worthy to be here, but praise God I belong! 
I'm so glad I'm a part of the Family of God,
I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by His Blood!
Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod,
For I'm part of the family,
The Family of God

Come one, come all to the family reunion
With mother and daddy so sweet
Come one, come all to the family reunion
It might be the last time we'll meet.
Now mother is sick she's tired and weary
She can't go another mile
She loves her children and she wants them near her
Once more just to see their smile.
What good will the roses do daddy up yonder
So why not give them today
While he is still living and loving his children
To daddy it's better this way.

Here we are gathered together as a family
Bound as one, lifting up our voices to the King of Kings
We cry Abba, Father, worthy is Your name
We cry Abba, Father, worthy is Your name
Here we are singing together as a family
Bound as one, lifting up our voices to the King of Kings
We sing Abba, Father, holy is Your name
Abba, Father, holy is Your name

You are the Lord, the Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You’re glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth
And for all You’ve done and yet to do 
With every breath I’m praising You
Desire of nations and every heart
You alone are God, You alone are God
You are the Lord, the Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You’re glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth
The morning star is shining through
And every eye is watching You
Revealed by nature and miracles
You are beautiful, You are beautiful 
You are the Lord, the Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You’re glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth
You are the Lord, the Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You’re glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth

"Far above all" is our Saviour enthroned;
Crowned is the Lamb who for sinners atoned;
Living forever to list to our call,
God hath exalted Him "far above all."
"Far above all!" "far above all!"
Jesus the Crucified, "far above all!"
Low at His footstool adoring we fall,
God hath exalted Him "far above all."
When the fierce tempest, uplifting its waves,
Seeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves;
Looking to Jesus, upheld by His hand,
Tread we the billows as safe as on land.
High are the cities that dare our assault,
Strong are the barriers that call us to halt;
March we on fearless, and down they must fall,
Vanquished by faith in Him "far above all."
His is the kingdom from pole unto pole;
"Far above all" while the ages shall roll;
With Him the victors, who followed His call,
Share in His royalty "far above all."

Far and near the fields are teeming
With the waves of ripened grain;
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O’er the sunny slope and plain.
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us, Lord, to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather
Ere the harvest time pass by.
Send them forth with morn’s first beaming,
Send them in the noontide’s glare;
When the sun’s last rays are gleaming,
Bid them gather everywhere.
O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
Gather now the sheaves of gold;
Heav’nward then at evening wending,
Thou shalt come with joy untold.

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial strains it unceasingly falls
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.
Peace, peace, wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above!
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love!
What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul,
So secure that no power can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll!
I am resting tonight in this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus’ control;
For I’m kept from all danger by night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul!
And I think when I rise to that city of peace,
Where the Anchor of peace I shall see,
That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing
In that heavenly kingdom will be:
Ah, soul! are you here without comfort and rest,
Marching down the rough pathway of time?
Make Jesus your Friend ere the shadows grow dark;
O accept of this peace so sublime!

Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling.
Then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand.
Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling.
None of these shall move me from Beulah Land.
I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky.
I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry.
O yes! I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating.
Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand.
Safe am I within the castle of God’s Word retreating.
Nothing then can reach me—’tis Beulah Land.
Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me;
I am safely sheltered here, protected by God’s hand.
Here the sun is always shining, here there’s naught can harm me.
I am safe forever in Beulah Land.
Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation.
Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way He planned.
Dwelling in the Spirit here I learn of full salvation.
Gladly I will tarry in Beulah Land.

Far be sorrow, tears and sighing!
Waves are calming, storms are dying,
Moses hath o’erpassed the sea,
Israel’s captive hosts are free;
Life by death slew death and saved us,
In His blood the Lamb hath saved us,
Clothing us with victory.
Jesus Christ from death has risen,
Lo! His Godhead bursts the prison,
While His Manhood passes free,
Vanquishing our misery.
Rise we free from condemnation;
Through our God’s humiliation,
Ours is now the victory.
Vain the foe’s despair and madness!
See the dayspring of our gladness!
Slaves no more of Satan we;
Children, by the Son set free;
Rise, for life with death has striven,
All the snares of hell are riven,
Rise and claim the victory.

Far beyond all comprehension
Is Jehovah's covenant love;
Who can fathom its dimension
Or its unknown limits prove?
Ere the earth upon its basis
By creating power was built,
His designs were wise and gracious
For removing human guilt.
He displayed His grand intention
On the mount at Calvary,
When He died for our redemption,
Lifted high upon the tree.
O, how sweet to view the flowing
Of His soul-redeeming blood!
With divine assurance knowing
That it made my peace with God.
Freely Thou wilt bring to heaven
All Thy chosen, ransomed race,
Who to Thee, their Head, were given
In the covenant of grace.

Far down the ages now,
Her journey well nigh done,
The pilgrim Church pursues her way,
And longs to reach her crown.
No wider is the gate,
No broader is the way,
No smoother is the ancient path
That leads to light and day.
No feebler is the foe,
No slacker grows the fight,
Nor less the need of armor tried,
Of shield and helmet bright.
Thus onward still we press,
Through evil and through good,
Through pain, or poverty, or want,
Through peril or through blood.
Still faithful to our God,
And to our Captain true,
We follow where He leads the way,
The kingdom still in view.

Far, far away, there’s a many-mansioned dwelling,
Where the Savior waits to welcome the dear souls for whom He died;
All across the darksome valley, I can hear their anthems swelling,
And amid the golden glory I can see them by His side.
In the home so far away.
Far, far away, there’s a haven deep and quiet,
Where the noiseless waves lie sleeping on the mountain-sheltered shore,
Where the surges never enter, where no stormy tempests riot,
Where the sails are furled forever and the ship goes out no more,
From the haven far away.
Onward I travel, in gladness or in sorrow,
Across these trackless waters, with His love to cheer me through;
And as every sunset closes, I can fancy that the morrow
Will fire the heav’nly mountains, with the haven full in view
And no longer far away.

Far, far away on Judea’s plains,
Shepherds of old heard the joyous strains:
Glory to God, glory to God,
Glory to God in the highest;
Peace on earth, good will to men;
Peace on earth, good will to men.
Sweet are these strains of redeeming love,
Message of mercy from heaven above:
Lord, with the angels we too would rejoice;
Help us to sing with the heart and voice:
Hasten the time when, from every clime,
Men shall unite in the strains sublime:

I’ve entered the land dearly bought by His blood,
Passed over Jordan, surrendered to God;
I’ve found His sufficiency here in this land,
Glory to Jesus forever!
Far, far on the other side,
I’m living across the river,
Burned are the bridges ’twixt me and the world,
Glory to Jesus forever!
The giants are conquered the spies said were here,
Jesus is victor, I need have no fear;
Summer in winter and joy all the year,
Glory to Jesus forever!
The manna is gone and the corn is my food,
Dead to the world and I’m living in God;
I’ve ceased saying can’t since I found that He could—
Glory to Jesus forever!

Far from my heavenly home,
Far from my Father’s breast,
Fainting I cry, blest Spirit, come
And speed me to my rest.
My spirit homeward turns
And fain would thither flee;
My heart, O Zion, droops and yearns,
When I remember thee.
To thee, to thee I press,
A dark and toilsome road;
When shall I pass the wilderness,
And reach the saint’s abode?
God of my life, be near;
On Thee my hopes I cast:
O guide me through the desert here,
And bring me home at last.

Far from my thoughts, vain world, begone,
Let my religious hours alone:
Fain would my eyes my Savior see;
I wait a visit, Lord, from Thee.
My heart grows warm with holy fire,
And kindles with a pure desire:
Come, my dear Jesus, from above,
And feed my soul with heav’nly love.
The trees of life immortal stand
In fragrant rows at Thy right hand;
And in sweet murmurs, by their side,
Rivers of bliss perpetual glide.
Haste, then, but with a smiling face,
And spread the table of Thy grace;
Bring down a taste of fruit divine,
And cheer my heart with sacred wine.
Bless’d Jesus, what delicious fare!
How sweet Thy entertainments are!
Never did angels taste above
Redeeming grace, and dying love.
Hail, great Immanuel, all divine!
In Thee Thy Father’s glories shine;
Thou brightest, sweetest, fairest One,
That eyes have seen or angels known.

Far off I see the goal—O Savior, guide me;
I feel my strength is small—be Thou beside me;
With vision ever clear, with love that conquers fear,
And grace to persevere, O Lord, provide me.
Whene’er Thy way seems strange, go Thou before me;
And, lest my heart should change, O Lord, watch o’er me;
But, should my faith prove frail, and I through blindness fail,
O let Thy grace prevail, and still restore me.
Should earthly pleasures wane, and joy forsake me;
And lonely hours of pain at length o’ertake me,
My hand in Thine hold fast till sorrow be o’erpast,
And gentle death at last for Heav’n awake me.
There, with the ransomed throng who praise forever
The love that made them strong to serve forever,
I, too, would seek Thy face, Thy finished work retrace,
And magnify Thy grace, redeemed forever.

Far off, O God, and yet most near,
Unseen, yet shining clear in all,
Thy presence moves, Thy ways appear,
In system’s rise and sparrow’s fall.
Thy purpose through the ages ran,
Thy Word Thy prophets bore abroad,
Thy love became a Son of Man,
To make men with Him sons of God.
Our eyes Thy loveliness discern,
Where nature weaves Thy wondrous dress,
And in sweet human lives we learn
The beauty of Thy holiness.
Our lives within Thy being stand,
Our sciences omniscience prove,
Thy law is but Thy clasping hand,
Thine order is Thy perfect love.

Far out on the desolate billow
The sailor sails the sea,
Alone with the night and the tempest,
Where countless dangers be;
Yet never alone is the Christian,
Who lives by faith and prayer;
For God is a Friend unfailing,
And God is ev’rywhere.
Far down in the earth’s dark bosom
The miner mines the ore;
Death lurks in the dark behind him,
And hides in the rock before.
Yet never alone is the Christian,
Who lives by faith and prayer;
Forth into the dreadful battle
The steadfast soldier goes;
No friend, when he lies adying,
His eyes to kiss and close.
Yet never alone is the Christian,
Who lives by faith and prayer;
Lord, grant as we sail life’s ocean,
Or delve in its mines of woe,
Or fight in its terrible conflict,
This comfort all to know,
That never alone is the Christian,
Who lives by faith and prayer;

Far-shining names from age to age
enrich the Church's heritage,
the loyal liegemen of the Lord,
who found in thee their great reward.
One name from that immortal throng
inspires to-day our festal song:
in loving memory we hold
the bishop and the saint of old,
who, far away in eastern land,
with gentle heart and open hand
loved all things living, shared his store
with homeless men who sought his door.
Friend of the poor, no less was he
the guardian saint of those at sea;
o'er wave-swept rock and sheltered bay
God's churches bear his name to-day.
And his the skill, the tender art
that wins the trustful, child-like heart:
his dearest title to the end
'Saint Nicolas, the children's friend.'
To thee, 0 Lord, the praise be given
for this true citizen of heaven
a star above the stormy sea
to lead the wanderer home to thee.

I believe my steps are growing wearier each day,
Still, I’ve got a journey on my mind.
Cares of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay,
And my one regret is leaving you behind.
If it proves to be his will that I am first to go,
And somehow I’ve a feeling it will be.
When it comes your time to travel likewise don’t you feel lost,
For I will be the first one that you see.
And I’ll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan.
I’ll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand.
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout,
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for 
your hand.
Through this world we have laboured hard to earn our meagre fare,
It’s brought us trembling hands and failing eyes.
I’ll just rest here on the shore and turn my eyes away,
Until you come and then we’ll see paradise.
x2

Farewell I gladly bid Thee,
False, evil world, farewell.
Thy life is vain and sinful,
With Thee I would not dwell.
I long to be in heaven,
In that untroubled sphere
Where they will be rewarded
Who served their God while here.
By Thy good counsel lead me,
O Son of God, my Stay;
In each perplexing trial
Help me, O Lord, I pray.
Mine hour of sorrow shorten,
Support my fainting heart,
From every cross deliver,
The crown of life impart.
When darkness round me gathers,
Thy name and cross, still bright,
Deep in my heart are sparkling
Like stars in blackest night.
O heart, this image cherish:
The Christ on Calvary,
How patiently He suffered
And shed His blood for me! 
Lord, hide my soul securely
Deep in Thy wounded side;
From every danger shield me
And to Thy glory guide.
He has been truly blessed
Who reaches heaven above;
He has found perfect healing
Who rests upon Thy love.
Lord, write my name, I pray Thee,
Now in the Book of Life
And with all true believers
Take me where joys are rife.
There let me bloom and flourish,
Thy perfect freedom prove,
And tell, as I adore Thee,
How faithful was Thy love.

Farewell, My Dear Brethren, The Time is At Hand
When we must be parted from this social band;
Our sev'ral engagements now call us away;
Separation is needful, and we must obey.
Farewell, my dear brethren, farewell for awhile.
We'll soon meet again if kind Providence smile,
But when we are parted and scattered abroad.
We'll pray for each other and trust in the Lord.
Farewell, younger brethren, just listed for war,
Sore trials await you, but Jesus is near;
Although you must travel this dark wilderness,
Your Captain's before you, he'll lead you to rest.
Farewell, my dear brethren, farewell all around;
Perhaps we'll not meet till the last trump shall sound;
To meet you in glory I give you my hand,
The Savior to praise in a pure social band.

I will part with thee, old master;
This is my firm resolve;
And I’ll boldly state my reason,
Why we must now dissolve.
The wages of sin is death,
The wages of sin is death,
The wages of sin is death, and woe,
And bitter remorse; I’ve found it so;
Bitter, bitter,
Bitter remorse and woe.
I have served thee long and faithful,
Confessed you were my lord;
All your way was dark and painful,
And what is my reward? 
I have given time and talents,
My health and honor, too,
And exposed my soul to torments,
And what did you bestow? 
You have flattered me, and promised
Much pleasure in your reign;
I have sowed and reaped your harvest,
Now what my wretched gain? 
While beneath your doleful bondage,
How oft your father came,
Saying, “There is here no passage
Out from your dark domain." 
But the blood of my Redeemer
Has saved me through and through,
So, in Jesus’ name, forever
I bid all sin adieu.

Tempted and tried will oft' me to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long;
While there are others living about us,
Never molested, though in the wrong.
Farther along we'll know more about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear;
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year.
Farther along we'll know more about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
Often I wonder why I must journey
Over a road so rugged and steep; 
While there are others living in comfort,
While with the lost I labor and weep.
Farther along we'll know more about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Faithful 'til death, said our loving Master, 
A few more days labor and wait;
Toils of the road will then be as nothing, 
As we sweep through the beautiful gates.
Farther along we'll know more about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
When we see Jesus coming in glory; 
When He comes from His home in the sky; 
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion.
We'll understand it all by and by.
Farther along we'll know more about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.

Fast sinks the sun to rest,
Fast fall the shades of night;
Fain would the weary heart
Keep love's frail flame alight,
End the day that fading dies
With an offering of sacrifice.
E'en as the Crucified,
Calm in the hour of death,
Into his Father's hands
Yielded his latest breath,
So my spirit would repose
Safe in God's mighty keeping close.
Meekly beneath his hand
Lieth my helplessness,
Thinking and caring naught
Save what he purposes,
And in utter calm abides,
Dead to self and all besides.
Be it not I who live
But God who lives in me,
Reigning and triumphing
In love's sweet majesty;
May he mine forever be,
God who One is in Trinity.

He roamed the desert looking for a home
The only thing he knew was God said go
He didn't question when or why or where
He knew Jehovah was already there 
Father Abraham, you trusted God no matter the plan
Father Abraham, all you needed was a word from the Great I Am
Father Abraham, you always kept God's promises in your hand
Father Abraham, I've always wanted to step out on faith, now I know I can
Thank you father Abraham 
(interlude) (Abraham, Father Abraham) 
A holy angel spoke about a son
Sarai laughed she said it couldn't be done
But she and Abraham chose to trust the Lord
And nine months later their baby boy was born 
(interlude) (Abraham) 
Your only son was to be sacrificed
What would you do, what would you tell your wife?
You knew you had to do what God had said
By faith in God you knew he'd come back from the dead 
(God loves you) How much God must have loved you at that moment (He understood 
what you're going through)
(A Sacrifice) Knowing soon He'd have to do the same (it's the only thing that He 
could do)
(Blessed Son) Through His son you were blessed
Your faith was counted as righteousness
Through His Son the world is saved (A son would save the world) 
(interlude) (Father Abraham, Father Abraham, Father Abraham, Father) 

Father, again in Jesus’ Name we meet,
And bow in penitence beneath Your feet;
Again to You our feeble voices raise,
To sue for mercy, and to sing Your praise.
O we would bless You for Your ceaseless care,
And all Your works from day to day declare;
Is not our life with hourly mercies crowned?
Does not Your arm encircle us around?
Alas, unworthy of Your boundless love,
Too oft with careless feet from You we rove;
But now, encouraged by Your voice, we come,
Returning sinners to a Father’s home.
O by that Name in Whom all fulness dwells,
O by that love which ev’ry love excels,
O by that blood so freely shed for sin,
Open blest mercy’s gate and take us in.

Father Almighty, bless us with Thy blessing,
Answer in love Thy children’s supplication;
Hear Thou our prayer, the spoken and unspoken;
Hear us, O Father.
Shepherd of souls, Who bringest all who seek Thee
To pastures green, beside the peaceful waters;
Tenderest Guide, in ways of cheerful duty,
Lead us, good Shepherd.
Father of mercy, from Thy watch and keeping
No place can part, nor hour of time remove us;
Give us Thy good, and save us from our evil,
Infinite Sprit!

Father and Friend! Thy light, Thy love,
Beaming through all Thy works we see;
Thy glory gilds the heavens above,
And all the earth is full of Thee.
Thy voice we hear, Thy presence feel,
While Thou, too pure for mortal sight,
Involved in clouds, invisible,
Reignest the Lord of life and light.
We know not in what hallowed part
Of the wide heavens Thy throne may be,
But this we know, that where Thou art,
Strength, wisdom, goodness dwell with Thee.
Thy children shall not faint nor fear,
Sustained by this exalted thought;
Since Thou, their God, art everywhere,
They cannot be where Thou art not!

Father, before Thy throne of light
The guardian angels bend,
And ever in Thy presence bright
Their psalms adoring blend;
And casting down each golden crown,
Beside the crystal sea,
With voice and lyre, in happy quire,
Hymn glory, Lord, to Thee.
And as the rainbow luster falls
Athwart their glowing wings,
While seraph unto seraph calls,
And each Thy goodness sings;
So may we feel, as low we kneel
To pray Thee for Thy grace,
That Thou art here for all who fear
The brightness of Thy face.
Here, where the angels see us come
To worship day by day,
Teach us to seek our heav’nly home,
And love Thee e’en as they;
Teach us to raise our notes of praise,
With them Thy love to own,
That childhood’s flower and manhood’s power
Be Thine, and Thine alone.

Father, bless our school today;
Be in all we do and say;
Be in every song we sing,
Every prayer to Thee we bring.
Jesus, well beloved Son,
May Thy will by us be done;
Come and meet with us today;
Teach us, Lord, Thyself, we pray.
Holy Spirit, mighty power,
Consecrate this Lord’s day hour;
Unto us Thine unction give;
Touch our souls that we may live.

Father eternal, Ruler of creation,
Spirit of life, which moved ere form was made;
Through the thick darkness covering every nation,
Light to man’s blindness, O be Thou our aid:
Thy kingdom come, O Lord, Thy will be done.
Races and peoples, lo! we stand divided,
And sharing not our griefs, no joy can share;
By wars and tumults love is mocked, derided,
His conquering cross no kingdom wills to bear:
Thy kingdom come, O Lord, Thy will be done.
Envious of heart, blind eyed, with tongues confounded,
Nation by nation still goes unforgiven;
In wrath and fear, by jealousies surrounded,
Building proud towers which shall not reach to heaven:
Thy kingdom come, O Lord, Thy will be done.
How shall we love Thee, holy, hidden Being,
If we love not the world which Thou hast made?
O give us brother love for better seeing
Thy world made flesh, and in a manger laid:
Thy kingdom come, O Lord, Thy will be done.

What have I done to You my Lord?
How could I nail You to the tree?
My evil desires, my selfish ways
I hung You in agony (2x)
My Father forgive me
I’ve done so wrongly
I’m not deserving of Your love
My Father have mercy
Tho’ I am not worthy
Don’t cast me away
Don’t cast me away from You
What have I done to You my Lord?
I tried to have it all my way
I lived for my pleasures
I broke Your heart
I turned my Father away (2x)

“Father, forgive," the Savior said
“They know not what they do";
His heart was moved when thus He prayed
For me, my friends, and you.
He saw, that as the Jews abused
And crucified His flesh,
So He, by us, would be refused,
And crucified afresh.
Through love of sin, we long were prone
To act as Satan bid;
But now, with grief and shame we own,
We knew not what we did.
We knew not the desert of sin,
Nor Whom we thus defied;
Nor where our guilty souls had been,
If Jesus had not died.
We knew not what a law we broke,
How holy, just and pure!
Nor what a God we durst provoke,
But thought ourselves secure.
But Jesus all our guilt foresaw,
And shed His precious blood
To satisfy the holy law,
And make our peace with God.
My sin, dear Savior, made Thee bleed,
Yet didst Thou pray for me!
I knew not what I did, indeed,
When ignorant of Thee.

Father, God, we glorify
Thy love to Adam’s seed;
Love that gave Thy Son to die,
And raised Him from the dead:
Him, for our offenses slain,
That we all might pardon find,
Thou hast brought to life again,
The Savior of mankind.
By Thy own right hand of power
Thou hast exalted Him,
Sent the mighty Conqueror
Thy people to redeem:
King of Saints, and Prince of Peace,
Him Thou hast for sinners giv’n,
Sinners from their sins to bless,
And lift them up to Heav’n.
Father, God, to us impart
The gift unspeakable;
Now in every waiting heart
Thy glorious Son reveal:
Quickened with our living Lord,
Let us in Thy Spirit rise,
Rise to all Thy life restored,
And bless Thee in the skies.

Father, Who hast gathered
This dear child to rest,
Unto Thee we yield him,
Sure Thou knowest best.
Thou, O Lord, Who gavest,
Dost Thine own reclaim;
Thou, O Lord, hast taken—
Blessed still Thy Name!
Thine by right creative,
By redemption Thine,
By regeneration
And the holy sign.
Thou Who didst endow him
With baptismal grace,
Now in love hast brought him
To behold Thy face.
Safe from all earth’s sorrow,
Safe from all its pains,
Now this child of Adam,
Paradise regains:
Safe from all temptation,
Safe from fear of sin,
Through the blood of sprinkling
Holy, bright and clean.
Lay we this dear body
In the earth to sleep,
His sweet soul commending
Unto Thee to keep:
Looking for the dawning
Of that deathless day,
When all earthly shadows
Shall have fled away.
Only grant us, Father,
Courage in our strife,
And with him a portion
In unending life.

Father, hear the prayer we offer:
Nor for ease that prayer shall be,
But for strength, that we may ever
Live our lives courageously.
Not forever in green pastures
Do we ask our way to be,
But the steep and rugged pathway
May we tread rejoicingly.
Not forever by still waters
Would we idly, quiet stay;
But would smite the living fountains
From the rocks along our way.
Be our strength in hours of weakness,
In our wanderings be our Guide;
Through endeavor, failure, danger,
Father, be Thou at our side.
Let our path be bright or dreary,
Storm or sunshine be our share;
May our souls in hope unweary
Make Thy work our ceaseless prayer.

God the Father, God the Son,
God the Spirit, Three in One,
hear us from thy heavenly throne:
Spare us, holy Trinity.
Part I
Father, hear thy children's call;
humbly at thy feet we fall,
prodigals, confessing all:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Christ, beneath thy cross, we blame
all our life of sin and shame;
penitent we breathe thy Name:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Holy Spirit, grieved and tried,
oft forgotten and defied,
now we mourn our stubborn pride:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Love, that caused us first to be,
Love, that bled upon the tree,
Love, that draws us lovingly:
we beseech thee, hear us.
We thy call have disobeyed,
into paths of sin have strayed,
and repentance have delayed:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Sick, we come to thee for cure,
guilty, seek thy mercy sure,
evil, long to be made pure:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Blind, we pray that we may see;
bound, we pray to be made free;
stained, we pray for sanctity:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Thou who hear'st each contrite sigh
bidding sinful souls draw nigh,
willing not that one should die.
we beseech thee, hear us.Amen.
Part II
By the gracious saving call,
spoken tenderly to all
who have shared man's guilt and fall.
we beseech thee, hear us.
By the nature Jesus wore,
by the stripes and death he bore,
by his life for evermore:
we beseech thee, hear us.
By the love that longs to bless,
pitying our sore distress,
leading us to holiness:
we beseech thee, hear us.
By the love so calm and strong,
patient still to suffer wrong
and our day of grace prolong:
we beseech thee, hear us.
By the love that speaks within,
calling us to flee from sin,
and the joy of goodness win:
we beseech thee, hear us.
By the love that bids thee spare,
by the heaven thou dost prepare,
by thy promises to prayer:
we beseech thee, hear us.Amen.
Part III
Teach us what thy love has borne,
that, with loving sorrow torn,
truly contrite we may mourn:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Gifts of light and grace bestow;
help us to resist the foe,
fearing what alone is woe:
we beseech thee.hear us.
Let not sin within us reign;
may we gladly suffer pain,
if it purge away our stain:
we beseech thee, hear us.
May we to all evil die,
fleshly longings crucify;
fix our hearts and thoughts on high:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Grant us faith to know thee near,
hail thy grace, thy judgment fear,
and through trial persevere:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Grant us hope from earth to rise,
and to strain with eager eyes
towards the promised heavenly prize:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Grant us love, thy love to own,
love to live for thee alone,
and the power of grace make known:
we beseech thee, hear us.
All our weak endeavors bless,
as we ever forward press;
lead us on to holiness:
we beseech thee, hear us.
Lead us daily nearer thee
till at last thy face we see,
crowned with thine own purity:
we beseech thee, hear us.Amen

Father, how wide Thy glories shine!
How high Thy wonders rise!
Known through the earth by thousand signs,
By thousand through the skies.
Those mighty orbs proclaim Thy power,
Their motions speak Thy skill,
And on the wings of every hour
We read Thy patience still.
But when we view Thy strange design
To save rebellious worms,
Our souls are filled with awe divine
To see what God performs.
Our thoughts are lost in reverent awe;
We love and we adore;
The first archangel never saw
So much of God before.
Part of Thy Name divinely stands
On all Thy creatures writ;
They show the labor of Thy hands,
Or impress of Thy feet.
When sinners break the Father’s laws,
The dying Son atones;
O the dear mysteries of His cross,
The triumph of his groans.
Here the whole Deity is known,
Nor dares a creature guess
Which of the glories brightest shone,
The justice, or the grace.
Now the full glories of the Lamb
Adorn the heavenly plains;
Sweet cherubs learn Immanuel’s Name,
And try their choicest strains.
O may I bear some humble part
In that immortal song!
Wonder and joy shall tune my heart,
And love command my tongue.

Father, I know that all my life
Is portioned out for me,
And the changes that are sure to come
I do not fear to see;
But I ask Thee for a present mind
Intent on pleasing Thee.
I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,
Through constant watching wise,
To meet the glad with joyful smiles,
And to wipe the weeping eyes;
And a heart at leisure from itself,
To soothe and sympathize.
I would not have the restless will
That hurries to and fro,
Seeking for some great thing to do
Or secret thing to know;
I would be treated as a child,
And guided where I go.
Wherever in the world I am,
In whatsoe’er estate,
I have a fellowship with hearts
To keep and cultivate;
And a work of lowly love to do
For the Lord on Whom I wait.
So I ask Thee for daily strength,
To none that ask denied,
And a mind to blend with outward life
While keeping at Thy side;
Content to fill a little space,
If Thou be glorified.
And if some things I do not ask
In my cup of blessing be,
I would have my spirit filled the more
With grateful love to Thee,
More careful, not to serve Thee much,
But to please Thee perfectly.
There are briers besetting every path
That call for patient care;
There is a cross in every lot,
And an earnest need for prayer;
But a lowly heart that leans on Thee
Is happy anywhere.
In a service which Thy will appoints
There are no bonds for me;
For my inmost heart is taught “the truth"
That makes Thy children “free."
And a life of self renouncing love
Is a life of liberty.

Father, I Long, I Faint to See
The place of thine abode;
I'd leave thy earthly courts and flee
Up to thy seat, my God!
Here I behold thy distant face,
And 'tis a pleasing sight;
But to abide in thine embrace
Is infinite delight.
There all the heav'nly hosts are seen,
In shining ranks they move,
And drink immortal vigor in
With wonder and with love
Then at thy feet with awful fear
Th'adoring armies fall;
With joy they shrink to nothing there,
Before, th'eternal All.
There I would vie with all the host
In duty and in bliss,
While less than nothing I would boast,
And vanity confess.
The more thy glories strike my eyes
The humbler I shall lie;
Thus, while I sink, my joys shall rise
Unmeasurably high.

Father, I scarcely dare to pray,
So clear I see, now it is done,
How I have wasted half my day,
And left my work but just begun.
So clear I see that things I thought
Were right or harmless were a sin;
So clear I see that I have sought,
Unconscious, selfish aims to win.
So clear I see that I have hurt
The souls I might have helped to save;
That I have slothful been, inert,
Deaf to the calls Thy leaders gave.
In outskirts of Thy kingdoms vast
Father, the humblest spot give me;
Set me the lowliest task Thou hast,
Let me repentant work for Thee.

Father, I sing thy wondrous grace,
I bless my Savior's name;
He bought salvation for the poor,
And bore the sinner's shame.
His deep distress has raised us high;
His duty and his zeal
Fulfilled the law which mortals broke,
And finished all thy will.
His dying groans, his living songs,
Shall better please my God
Than harp or trumpet's solemn sound,
Than goat's or bullock's blood.
This shall his humble followers see,
And set their hearts at rest
They by his death draw near to thee,
And live for ever blest.
Let heav'n and all that dwell on high
To God their voices raise,
While lands and seas assist the sky,
And join t' advance the praise.
Zion is thine, most holy God,
Thy Son shall bless her gates;
And glory purchased by his blood
For thy own Isr'el waits

Father, I stretch my hands to thee,
No other help I know;
If thou withdraw thyself from me,
Ah! whither shall I go? 
What did thy only Son endure
Before I drew my breath;
What pain, what labour, to secure
My soul from endless death! 
O Jesus, could I this believe,
I now should feel thy power;
Now all my wants thou wouldst relieve
In this, the accepted hour.
Author of faith, to thee I lift
My weary, longing eyes:
O let me now receive that gift!
My soul without it dies.
Surely thou canst not let me die;
O speak, and I shall live!
For here I will unwearied lie,
Till thou thy Spirit give.
How would my fainting soul rejoice,
Could I but see thy face!
Now let me hear thy quickening voice,
And taste thy pardoning grace!

Now let me hear thy quickening voice,
And taste thy pardoning grace! 

Father, I want you to hold me
I want to rest in your arms today
Father, I want you to show me
How much you care for me in every way
I bring all my cares (fears)
And I lay them at your feet
You are always there (here)
And you love me as I am
Yes you love me as I am
Father, I know you will hold me
I know I am your child your own
Father, I know you will show me
I feel your arms holding me I'm not alone

Father, if justly still we claim
To us and ours the promise made,
To us be graciously the same,
And crown with living fire our head.
Our claim admit, and from above
Of holiness the Spirit shower,
Of wise discernment, humble love,
And zeal, and unity, and power.
The Spirit of convincing speech,
Of power demonstrative, impart,
Such as may every conscience reach,
And sound the unbelieving heart;
The Spirit of refining fire,
Searching the inmost of the mind,
To purge all fierce and foul desire,
And kindle life more pure and kind;
The Spirit of faith, in this thy day,
To break the power of cancelled sin,
Tread down its strength, o'erturn its sway,
And still the conquest more than win.
The Spirit breathe of inward life,
Which in our hearts thy laws may write;
Then grief expires, and pain, and strife:
'Tis nature all, and all delight.

Father in Heaven, in Thy love abounding,
Hear these Thy children through the world resounding,
Lord, in Thy praises thanks for peace abiding,
Ever abiding.
Filled be our hearts with peace beyond comparing,
Peace in Thy world, joy to all heart’s despairing,
Firm is our trust in Thee for peace enduring,
Ever enduring.
God of our fathers, strengthen every nation,
In Thy great peace where only is salvation,
So may the world its future spread before Thee
Thus to adore Thee.

Father in Heaven, Who lovest all,
O help Thy children when they call,
That they may build from age to age
An undefiled heritage.
Teach us to bear the yoke in youth,
With steadfastness and careful truth,
That, in our time, Thy grace may give
The truth whereby the nations live.
Teach us to rule ourselves alway,
Controlled and cleanly night and day,
That we may bring, if need arise,
No maimed or worthless sacrifice.
Teach us to look in all our ends,
On Thee for Judge, and not our friends,
That we, with Thee, may walk uncowed
By fear or favor of the crowd.
Teach us the strength that cannot seek,
By deed or thought, to hurt the weak,
That, under Thee, we may possess
Man’s strength to comfort man’s distress.
Teach us delight in simple things,
And mirth that has no bitter springs,
Forgiveness free of evil done,
And love to all men ’neath the sun.

Father of heaven, whose love profound
a ransom for our souls hath found,
before thy throne we sinners bend;
to us thy pardoning love extend.
Almighty Son, Incarnate Word,
our Prophet, Priest, Redeemer, Lord,
before thy throne we sinners bend;
to us thy saving grace extend.
Eternal Spirit, by whose breath
the soul is raised from sin and death,
Before thy throne we sinners bend;
to us thy quickening power extend.
Jehovah - Father, Spirit, Son -
mysterious Godhead, Three in One,
before thy throne we sinners bend;
grace, pardon, life to us extend.

Father in high Heaven dwelling,
May our evening song be telling
Of Thy mercy large and free:
Through the day Thy love hath fed us,
Through the day Thy care hath led us
With divinest charity.
This day’s sins, O pardon, Savior,
Evil thoughts, perverse behavior,
Envy, pride, and vanity;
From the world, the flesh, deliver,
Save us now, and save us ever,
O Lamb of Calvary!
From enticements of the devil,
From the might of spirits evil,
Be our shield and panoply:
Let Thy pow’r this night defend us,
And a heavenly peace attend us,
And angelic company.
While the night dews are distilling,
Holy Ghost, each heart be filling
With Thine own serenity:
Softly let our eyes be closing
Loving souls on Thee reposing,
Ever blessed Trinity.

Father, in Whom we live, in Whom we 
are and move,
The glory, power and praise receive for Thy creating love.
Let all the angel throng give thanks to God on high,
While earth repeats the joyful song and echoes to the sky.
Incarnate Deity, let all the ransomed race
Render in thanks their lives to Thee for Thy redeeming grace.
The grace to sinners showed ye heavenly choirs proclaim,
And cry “Salvation to our God, salvation to the Lamb!"
Spirit of Holiness, let all Thy saints adore
Thy sacred energy, and bless Thine heart renewing power.
Not angel tongues can tell Thy love’s ecstatic height,
The glorious joy unspeakable the beatific sight.
Eternal, Triune God, let all the hosts above,
Let all on earth below record and dwell upon Thy love.
When heaven and earth are fled before Thy glorious face,
Sing all the saints Thy love hath made Thine everlasting praise.

Father, in Whom we live, in Whom we are and move,
The glory, power and praise receive for Thy creating love.
Let all the angel throng give thanks to God on high,
While earth repeats the joyful song and echoes to the sky.

When you're in a tempting situation
Listening to faulty information
It can be a real complication
If you don't have a heavenly fixation
He can see the future
And He knows what's best
Father knows best
Father knows best
Father knows best
Father knows best
When you're in a tempting situation
Enter into Holy conversation
With the father of the whole creation
He'll see you through that's no exaggeration

Father, lead me day by day,
Ever in Thine own sweet way;
Teach me to be pure and true;
Show me what I ought to do.
When in danger, make me brave,
Make me know that Thou canst save;
Keep me safe by Thy dear side;
Let me in Thy love abide.
When I’m tempted to do wrong,
Make me steadfast, wise and strong;
And when all alone I stand,
Shield me with Thy mighty hand.
When my heart is full of glee,
Help me to remember Thee,
Happy most of all to know
That my Father loves me so.

Father, let me dedicate, all this year to Thee,
In whatever worldly state Thou wilt have me be:
Not from sorrow, pain or care, freedom dare I claim;
This alone shall be my prayer, glorify Thy Name.
Can a child presume to choose where or how to live?
Can a Father’s love refuse all the best to give?
More Thou givest every day than the best can claim
Nor withholdest aught that may glorify Thy Name.
If in mercy Thou wilt spare joys that yet are mine;
If on life, serene and fair, brighter rays may shine;
Let my glad heart, while it sings, Thee in all proclaim,
And, whate’er the future brings, glorify Thy Name.
If Thou callest to the cross, and its shadow come,
Turning all my gain to loss, shrouding heart and home;
Let me think how Thy dear Son to His glory came,
And in deepest woe pray on, “Glorify Thy Name."
Some hymnals alter the last verse to:
If we must in grief and loss Thy behest obey,
If beneath the shadowy cross liest our homeward way;
We will think what Thy dear Son once for us became,
And 

Father, loving Father,
Hear Thy children’s call;
With Thy love enfold us,
And protect us all.
From the dawn’s first glimmer,
To the close of day
May we feel Thee near us
On our earthly way.
And from evening prayer time
Through the dark of night,
Let us rest in quietness
Until morn brings light.
Teach our tongues to praise Thee
In the hymns we sing;
Teach our hearts to love Thee
As our voices ring.

Father, make us loving, gentle, thoughtful, kind;
Fill us with Thy Spirit, make us of Thy mind.
Help us love each other, more and more each day,
Help us follow Jesus, in the narrow way.
We would learn of Jesus,
Help us here below,
Follow in His footsteps,
Who hath loved us so.
Father, we would ever, live as in Thy sight;
Thou dost know our longings after what is right.
Fill our hearts with kindness as we onward go,
Teach us to be loving, Thou hast loved us so.
Help us to remember, Thou art ever near;
Teach us lovingkindness, tenderness and cheer.
There is much of sorrow, in this world below;
Father, make us loving, Thou hast loved us so.

Father, Most High, be with us,
Unseen, Thy goodness showing,
And Christ the Word Incarnate,
And Spirit grace bestowing.
O Trinity, O Oneness
Of light and power exceeding;
O God of God Eternal
O God, from Both proceeding!
While daylight hours are passing,
We live and work before Thee;
Now, ere we rest in slumber,
We gather to adore Thee.
Our Christian name and calling
Of our new birth remind us;
The Spirit’s gifts and sealing
To firm obedience bind us.
Begone, ye powers of evil
With snares and wiles unholy!
Disturb not with your temptings
The spirits of the lowly.
Depart! for Christ is present,
Beside us, yea, within us;
Away! His sign, ye know it,
The victory shall win us.
Awhile the body resteth;
The spirit, wakeful ever,
Abideth in communion
With Christ, Who sleepeth never,
To God, th’Eternal Father,
To Christ, our sure salvation,
To God, the Holy Spirit,
Be endless adoration.

Father most holy, merciful and tender;
Jesus our Savior, with the Father reigning;
Spirit all kindly, Advocate, Defender,
Light never waning;
Trinity sacred, Unity unshaken;
Deity perfect, giving and forgiving,
Light of the angels, Life of the forsaken,
Hope of the living;
Maker of all things, all Thy creatures praise Thee;
Lo, all things serve Thee through Thy whole creation:
Hear us, Almighty, hear us as we raise Thee
Heart’s adoration.
To the all ruling triune God be glory:
Highest and greatest, help Thou our endeavor;
We, too, would praise Thee, giving honor worthy
Now and forever.

Father of all, from land and sea
The nations sing, “Thine, Lord, are we,
Countless in number, but in Thee
May we be one."
O Son of God, Whose love so free
For men did make Thee Man to be,
United to our God in Thee
May we be one.
Thou, Lord didst once for all atone;
Thee may both Jew and Gentile own
Of their two walls the Corner Stone,
Making them one.
In Thee we are God’s Israel,
Thou art the world’s Emmanuel,
In Thee the saints forever dwell,
Millions but one.
Thou art the Fountain of all good,
Cleansing with Thy most precious blood,
And feeding us with angels’ food,
Making us one.
Join high and low, join young and old
In love that never waxes cold;
Under one Shepherd, in one fold,
Make us all one.
O Spirit blest, Who from above,
Cam’st gently gliding like a dove
Calm all our strife, give faith and love;
O make us one.
O Trinity in Unity,
One only God, in Persons Three,
Dwell ever in our hearts; like Thee
May we be one.
So, when the world shall pass away,
May we awake with joy and say,
“Now in the bliss of endless day
We all are one."

Father of all, to Thee
With loving hearts we pray,
Through Him, in mercy given,
The Life, the Truth, the Way;
From Heav’n, Thy throne, in mercy shed
Thy blessings on each bended head.
Father of all, to Thee
Our contrite hearts we raise,
Unstrung by sin and pain,
Long voiceless in Thy praise;
Breathe Thou the silent chords along,
Until they tremble into song.
Father of all, to Thee
We breathe unuttered fears,
Deep hidden in our souls,
That have no voice but tears;
Take Thou our hand, and through the wild
Lead gently each trustful child.
Father of all, may we
In praise our tongues employ,
When gladness fills the soul
With deep and hallowed joy;
In storm and calm give us to see
The path of peace which leads to Thee.

Father of all, whose powerful voice
Called forth this universal frame,
Whose mercies over all rejoice,
Through endless ages still the same:
Inflame our hearts with perfect love,
In us the work of faith fulfil;
So not heaven's host shall swifter move
Than we on earth, to do thy will.
On thee we cast our care; we live
Through thee, who know'st our every need;
O feed us with thy grace, and give
Our souls this day the living bread.
Eternal, spotless Lamb of God,
Before the world's foundation slain,
Sprinkle us ever with thy blood,
O cleanse, and keep us ever clean!
Giver and Lord of life, whose power
And guardian care for all are free,
To thee, in fierce temptation's hour,
From sin and Satan let us flee.
Thine, Lord, we are, and ours thou art;
In us be all thy goodness showed.
Renew, enlarge, and fill our heart
With peace, and joy, and heaven, and God.
Thrice holy! Thine the kingdom is,
The power omnipotent is thine;
And, when created nature dies,
Thy never-ceasing glories shine.

We come into Your presence
To sing a song to You
A song of praise and honour
For all the things You helped us through
You gave us life worth living
A life of love with You
And now I just love giving
All my praises back to You
You are the Father of Creation
The risen Lamb of God
You’re the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day
And You set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I can walk with You
Every night and every day

Father of everlasting grace,
Thy goodness and Thy truth we praise,
Thy goodness and Thy truth we prove;
Thou hast, in honor of Thy Son,
The gift unspeakable sent down,
The Spirit of life, and power and love.
Send us the Spirit of Thy Son,
To make the depths of Godhead known,
To make us share the life divine;
Send Him the sprinkled blood to apply,
Send Him our souls to sanctify,
And show and seal us ever Thine.
So shall we pray, and never cease;
So shall we thankfully confess
Thy wisdom, truth, and power, and love;
With joy unspeakable adore,
And bless and praise Thee evermore,
And serve Thee as Thy hosts above:
Till, added to that heavenly choir,
We raise our songs of triumph higher,
And praise Thee in a nobler strain,
Out-soar the first-born seraph’s flight,
And sing, with all our friends in light,
Thy everlasting love to man.

Father of glory, to Thy Name,
Immortal praise we give,
Who dost an act of grace proclaim
And bid us rebels live.
Immortal honor to the Son,
Who makes Thine anger cease;
Our lives He ransomed with His own
And died to make our peace.
To Thine almighty Spirit be
Immortal glory giv’n,
Whose teachings bring us near to Thee
And train us up for Heav’n.
Let men with their united voice
Adore th’eternal God
And spread His honors and their joys
Through nations far abroad.
Let faith and love and duty join
One grateful song to raise;
Let saints in earth and Heav’n combine
In harmony and praise.

Father of Heaven, Whose love profound
A ransom for our souls hath found,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy pardoning love extend.
Almighty Son, Incarnate Word,
Our Prophet, Priest, Redeemer, Lord,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;

Eternal Spirit, by Whose breath
The soul is raised from sin and death,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy quickening power extend.
Jehovah—Father, Spirit, Son—
Mysterious Godhead, Three in One,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
Grace, pardon, life to us extend.

Father of Jesus Christ, my Lord,
My Savior and my Head;
I trust in Thee, Whose powerful Word
Hath raised Him from the dead.
In hope, against all human hope,
Self desperate, I believe;
Thy quickening Word shall raise me up,
Thou shalt Thy Spirit give.
Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees,
And looks to that alone;
Laughs at impossibilities,
And cries, “It shall be done!"
To Thee the glory of Thy power
And faithfulness I give;
I shall in Christ, at that glad hour,
And Christ in me shall live.
Obedient faith that waits on Thee,
Thou never wilt reprove;
Bt Thou wilt form Thy Son in me,
And perfect me in love.

Father of lights, in Whom there is no shadow,
Giver of every good and perfect gift!
With one accord we seek Thy holy presence,
Gladly our hearts to Thee in praise we lift.
Glad for the cause that binds our lives together,
Through Thee united, worshiping as one;
Glad for the crowning gift that Thou hast given,
Sending, to light the world, Thine only Son.
Light of the world, through Whom we know the Father!
Pour out upon us Thine abiding love,
That we may know its depth and height and splendor,
That heaven may come to earth from heaven above.
Thou art the Christ! To Thee we own allegiance.
May our devotion sweep from sea to sea,
Even as we, the gift from Thee receiving,
Joyfully minister that gift for Thee.

Father of love, our Guide and Friend,
O lead us gently on,
Until life’s trial time shall end,
And heav’nly peace be won.
We know not what the path may be
As yet by us untrod;
But we can trust our all to Thee,
Our Father and our God.
If called, like Abraham’s child, to climb
The hill of sacrifice,
Some angel may be there in time;
Deliverance shall arise.
Or, if some darker lot be good,
O teach us to endure
The sorrow, pain or solitude,
That makes the spirit pure.
Christ by no flowery pathway came;
And we, His followers here,
Must do Thy will and praise Thy Name,
In hope, and love and fear.
And, till in Heav’n we sinless bow,
And faultless anthems raise,
O Father, Son, and Spirit, now,
Accept our feeble praise.

Father of love and power,
Guard Thou our evening hour,
Shield with Thy might;
For all Thy care this day
Our grateful thanks we pay,
And to our Father pray,
Bless us tonight!
Jesus, Emmanuel,
Come, in Thy love to dwell
In hearts contrite.
For all our sins we grieve,
But we Thy grace receive,
And in Thy Word believe;
Bless us tonight!
Spirit of holiness,
Gentle, transforming, grace,
Indwelling Light!
Soothe Thou each weary breast,
Now let Thy peace possessed
Calm us to perfect rest;
Bless us tonight.

Father of love, of justice and of mercy,
Thou art the dawn, the star at eventide;
Show Thou Thy face, and light my way to Calv’ry,
There all my sins in Thee to hide.
I bring Thee all my sins,
None can forgive but Thee.
I bring Thee all, I bring Thee all;
O, give Thyself to me, I bring Thee all.
O Thou, of Whom the heav’ns are but a symbol,
Be Thou the sun that draws my heart to Thee;
Be Thou the light the stars at night do kindle,
Thy love is more than all to me.
I bring Thee all my heart,
None do I love like Thee.
O Man of Sorrows, praying in the garden,
Thy sweat as blood falls down upon the ground.
In that dark agony my sins are pardoned;
My solace in Thy grief is found.
I bring Thee all my tears,
None can console like Thee.

Father of me, and all mankind,
And all the hosts above,
Let every understanding mind
Unite to praise Thy love.
To know Thy nature, and Thy Name,
One God in Persons three;
And glorify the great I AM,
Through all eternity.
Thy kingdom come, with power and grace,
To every heart of man;
Thy peace, and joy, and righteousness,
In all our bosoms reign.
The righteousness that never ends,
But makes an end of sin,
The joy that human thought transcends
Into our souls bring in:
The kingdom of established peace,
Which can no more remove;
The perfect power of godliness,
The omnipotence of love.

Father of men, in Whom are one
All humankind beneath Thy sun,
Stablish our work in Thee begun.
Except the house be built of Thee,
In vain the builder’s toil must be:
O strengthen our infirmity.
Man lives not for himself alone,
In others’ good he finds his own;
Life’s worth in fellowship is known.
We, friends and comrades on life’s way,
Gather within these walls to pray:
Bless Thou our fellowship today.
O Christ, our Elder Brother, Who
By serving man God’s will didst do,
Help us to serve our brethren, too.
Guide us to seek the things above,
The base to shun, the pure approve,
To live by Thy free law of love.
In all our work, in all our play,
Be with us, Lord, our Friend, our Stay;
Lead onward to the perfect day:
Then may we know, earth’s lesson o’er,
With comrades missed or gone before,
Heav’n’s fellowship for evermore.

Father of mercies, in Thy Word
What endless glory shines!
Forever be Thy Name adored
For these celestial lines.
Here may the wretched sons of want
Exhaustless riches find;
Riches above what earth can grant,
And lasting as the mind.
Here the fair tree of knowledge grows
And yields a free repast;
And richer fruits than nature shows
Invite the longing taste.
Amidst these gloomy wilds below,
When dark and sad we stray,
Here beams of Heaven relieve our woe,
And guide to endless day.
Here springs of consolation rise
To cheer the fainting mind,
And thirsty souls receive supplies,
And sweet refreshment find.
Here the Redeemer’s welcome voice
Spreads heavenly peace around
And life and everlasting joys
Attend the blissful sound.
Oh, may these hallowed pages be
Our joy by day and night,
And still new beauties may we see,
And still increasing light.
Divine Instructor, gracious Lord,
O grant our fervent prayer,
Teach us to love Thy sacred Word,
And view the Savior there.

Father of mercies! God of love!
Whose kind compassion still we prove,
Our praise accept, and bless us here,
As brought to this—another year.
We sing Thy goodness all divine,
Whose radiant beams around us shine,
’Tis through Thy goodness we appear
Preserved to this—another year.
Our souls, our all we here resign;
Make us, and keep us ever Thine;
And grant that in Thy love and fear
We may begin—another year.
Be this our sweet experience still,
To know and do Thy holy will;
Then shall our souls, with joy sincere,
Bless Thee for this—another year.
Still, Lord, through life Thy love display,
And then in death’s approaching day,
We’ll joyful part with all that’s here,
Nor wish on earth—another year.

Father of peace, and God of love,
We own Thy pow’r to save,
That pow’r by which our Shepherd rose
Victorious o’er the grave.
Him from the dead Thou brought’st again,
When by His sacred blood,
Confirmed and sealed forevermore
Th’eternal cov’nant stood.
O may Thy Spirit seal our souls,
And mold them to Thy will,
That our weak hearts no more may stray,
But keep Thy cov’nant still.
That all we think and all we do
Be pleasing in Thy sight,
Through Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise
In endless glory bright.

Father of spirits, Whose divine control
Doth bind the soul and body into one;
Thou wilt restore this body now undone;
For once it was the mansion of a soul,
Where dwelt the glowing wisdom of Thy Son.
Thou, Maker of the body, dost ordain
That this Thine image, molded by Thy will,
Our every hope in glory shall fulfill;
So, till the body Thou dost build again,
Thou wilt preserve the spirit freed from ill.
In that blest region shall this spirit dwell
Where flowers undying bloom on every side:
For lo, we trust Thy Word, O Crucified,
When in Thy triumph over death and hell,
The thief forgiven took Thee for his Guide.
Our brother goeth by the shining way,
That ever to the faithful open lies:
Lord, train Thy servant now in Paradise,
And bless him in his fatherland, we pray,
Till Thou shalt bid his body to arise.
Our sister goeth by the shining way,
That ever to the faithful open lies:
Lord, train Thy servant now in Paradise,
And bless her in her fatherland, we pray,
Till Thou shalt bid her body to arise.

Father, our hearts we lift,
Up to Thy gracious throne,
And bless Thee for the precious gift,
Of Thine incarnate Son;
The gift unspeakable,
We thankfully receive,
And to the world Thy goodness tell,
And to Thy glory live.
Jesus the holy Child,
Doth by His birth declare,
That God and men are reconciled,
And one in Him we are;
Salvation through His Name
To all mankind is giv’n,
And loud His infant cries proclaim
A peace ’twixt earth and Heav’n.
A peace on earth He brings,
Which never more shall end;
The Lord of hosts, the King of kings,
Declares Himself our Friend;
Assumes our flesh and blood,
That we His Spirit may gain;
The everlasting Son of God,
The mortal Son of man.
His kingdom from above,
He doth to us impart,
And pure benevolence and love,
O’erflow the faithful heart;
Changed in a moment we
The sweet attraction find,
With open arms of charity
Embracing all mankind.
O might they all receive,
The new-born Prince of Peace,
And meekly in His Spirit live,
And in His love increase!
Till He convey us home,
Cry every soul aloud,
“Come, Thou Desire of nations, come,
And take us up to God."

Father, please (please) send your love down to me
Like a breeze (breeze), blowing soothing release
Love (love) that has set my soul free, Father, please (please) 
Father, please (please) send your Spirit to me
Never cease (cease) to inspire me

Father, please send your love down to me

Like a breeze (breeze), blowing soothing release

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
In solemn power come down!
Present with Thy heavenly host,
Thine ordinance to crown:
See a sinful worm of earth!
Bless to him the cleansing flood,
Plunge him, by a second birth,
Into the depths of God.
Let the promised inward grace
Accompany the sign;
On his new-born soul impress
The character divine;
Father, all Thy Name reveal!
Jesus, all Thy Name impart!
Holy Ghost, renew, and dwell
For ever in his heart!

Father, Thou art calling, calling to us plainly;
To the spirit comes Thy loving message evermore;
Holy One, uplift us, nor forever vainly
Stand calling us and waiting at the door.
In the whirling tempest and the storm Thou livest,
In the rain, and in the sweetness of the afterglow;
Summer’s golden bounty, winter’s snow, Thou givest,
And blooming meadows where sweet waters flow.
Clearer still and dearer is Thy voice appealing,
Deep within the spirit’s secret being speaking low:
Enter, O our Father! truth and life revealing;
From every evil free us as we go.
In Thee living, moving, unto Thee uprearing
All the hope and joyfulness and trust that fill the soul,
Father, we adore Thee, asking naught nor fearing;
We cannot wander from Thy dear control.

Father, to thee I come,
owning how weak I am,
grant thy sustaining arm; lead me, I pray.
More of thy love I'd have;
nearer to thee would live;
earnest heart service give, day after day.
In the straight narrow path,
thou bidd'st me walk by faith;
O grant the grace that hath aided alway.
When I shall tempted be,
nothing but clouds can see,
strengthen my trust in thee; let me not stray.
When comes that final night,
ere faith is changed to sight,
be thou the perfect light, leading to day.

Father, to Thee we look in all our sorrow,
Thou art the Fountain whence our healing flows;
Dark though the night, joy cometh with the morrow;
Safely they rest who on Thy love repose.
When fond hopes fail and skies are dark before us,
When the vain cares that vex our lives increase,
Comes with its calm the thought that Thou art o’er us,
And we grow quiet, folded in Thy peace.
Naught shall affright us, on Thy goodness leaning;
Low in the heart faith singeth still her song;
Chastened by pain we learn life’s deeper meaning,
And in our weakness Thou dost make us strong.
Patient, O heart, though heavy be Thy sorrows;
Be not cast down, disquieted in vain;
Yet shalt thou praise Him, when these darkened furrows,
Where now He plougheth, wave with golden grain.

Father, we come, with youth and vigor pressing,
gladly to serve, our loyalty to own;
grant that we may, thy holy Name confessing,
know thy Son Christ, and seek to make him known.
Be with us, Lord; we kneel in supplication,
in bonds of fellowship before thy throne;
by fervent prayer, by willing consecration,
help us to know the Christ and make him known.
Feed us, 0 Lord, that we may rise victorious,
filled with the power that comes from tbee alone,
inspired with zeal to face life's challenge glorious,
eager to know the Christ and make him known.

Father, we praise Thee, now the night is over;
Active and watchful, stand we all before Thee;
Singing, we offer, prayer and meditation;
Thus we adore Thee.
Monarch of all things, fit us for Thy mansions;
Banish our weakness, health and wholeness sending;
Bring us to Heaven, where Thy saints united
Joy without ending.
All holy Father, Son and equal Spirit,
Trinity blessed, send us Thy salvation;
Thine is the glory, gleaming and resounding
Through all creation.

Father, whate’er of earthly bliss
Thy sovereign will denies,
Accepted at Thy throne, let this
My humble prayer, arise:
Give me a calm and thankful heart,
From every murmur free;
The blessing of Thy grace impart,
And make me live to Thee.
Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine
My life and death attend,
Thy presence through my journey shine,
And crown my journey’s end.

Father, when shall all the weary earth
Cease from sighing and ring out its mirth?
Triumph in its grand, immortal birth,
Into wondrous life with God.
Christ is coming as the King of kings;
Shout, ye ransomed, o’er the grace He brings;
Hark! the whole earth with the welcome rings,
Hallelujah, praise His Name!
Savior, when shall my poor sinful soul
On Thee all its sins and sorrow roll?
Know Thy full salvation and be whole?
When, my Jesus, wilt Thou come?
Enter now upon Thy glorious reign!
Come and raise to life what sin hath slain!
O’er my heart and o’er the world regain
Thy dominion! Jesus, come!

Father, Who art alone
Our Helper and our Stay;
O hear us! as we plead
For loved ones far away;
And shield with Thine almighty hand
Our wanderers by sea and land.
O compass with Thy love
The daily path they tread!
And may Thy light and truth
Upon their hearts be shed;
That, one in all things with Thy will,
Heav’n’s peace and joy their souls may fill.
Guard them from every harm
When dangers shall assail,
And teach them that Thy power
Can never, never fail;
We cannot with our loved ones be,
But trust them, Father, unto Thee.

Father, Who dost Thy children feed
With manna rained from above;
Who dost the saving chalice give,
Filled by Thy hand in wondrous love:
We praise Thee for Thy mercies sent
To us in this great sacrament.
O Word made flesh, Whom we adore,
The living Bread sent down from Heav’n,
Whose wondrous passion here shown forth
Is the great pledge of sin forgiven;
We praise Thee for Thy mercies sent
To us in this great sacrament.
O Holy Spirit, Who dost reign
These earthly elements to bless,
Making the bread His flesh to be,
The wine His blood, as we confess;
We praise Thee for Thy mercies sent
To us in this great sacrament.
Ye holy angels, who, with us,
Around God’s altar lowly bow,
Adoring there the Crucified,
Whose precious death is pleaded now,
O praise Him for His mercies sent
To us in this great sacrament!
Ye blessed saints, enthroned on high,
Who once the paths of earth did tread,
Who reached in safety God’s abode,
As strengthened by this living bread;
O praise Him for His mercies sent
To us in this great sacrament!
O Holy Father, Holy Son,
And Holy Spirit, Whom we love,
Guide, strengthen, save us here below,
And bring us to our home above,
To praise Thee for Thy mercies sent
To us in this great sacrament!

Father, Who hast gathered
This dear child to rest,
Unto Thee we yield him,
Sure Thou knowest best.
Thou, O Lord, Who gavest,
Dost Thine own reclaim;
Thou, O Lord, hast taken—
Blessed still Thy Name!
Thine by right creative,
By redemption Thine,
By regeneration
And the holy sign.
Thou Who didst endow him
With baptismal grace,
Now in love hast brought him
To behold Thy face.
Safe from all earth’s sorrow,
Safe from all its pains,
Now this child of Adam,
Paradise regains:
Safe from all temptation,
Safe from fear of sin,
Through the blood of sprinkling
Holy, bright and clean.
Lay we this dear body
In the earth to sleep,
His sweet soul commending
Unto Thee to keep:
Looking for the dawning
Of that deathless day,
When all earthly shadows
Shall have fled away.
Only grant us, Father,
Courage in our strife,
And with him a portion
In unending life.

Father, Who on man dost shower
Gifts of plenty from Thy dower,
To Thy people give the power
All Thy gifts to use aright.
Give pure happiness in leisure,
Temperance in every pleasure,
Holy use of earthly treasure,
Bodies clear and spirits bright.
Lift from this and every nation
All that brings us degradation;
Quell the forces of temptation;
Put Thine enemies to flight.
Be with us, Thy strength supplying,
That with energy undying,
Every foe of man defying,
We may rally to the fight.
Thou Who art our Captain ever,
Lead us on to great endeavor;
May Thy Church the world deliver:
Give us wisdom, courage, might.
Father, Who has sought and loved us,
Son of God, Whose love has bound us,
Holy Ghost, within us, round us—
Hear us, Godhead infinite.

Father, Who the light this day
Out of darkness didst create,
Shine upon us now, we pray,
While within Thy courts we wait.
Wean us from the works of night,
Make us children of the light.
Savior, Who this day didst break
The dark prison of the tomb,
Bid our slumbering souls awake,
Shine through all their sin and gloom.
Let us, from our bonds set free,
Rise from sin and live to Thee.
Blessed Spirit, Comforter,
Sent this day from Christ on high,
Lord, on us Thy gifts confer,
Cleanse, illumine, sanctify.
All Thy fullness shed abroad;
Lead us to the truth of God

Father, Whose creating hand
Made the ocean and the land;
All Thy creatures are Thy care,
Thou art present everywhere.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
Christ, Who didst of old appear
On the waters, drawing near;
Thou art able still to save,
Calmly ruling wind and wave.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
Holy Ghost, Whose presence shed
Life where all was dark and dead,
By Thy breath we move and live,
Thou dost light and order give.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
God, to Whom our life we owe,
God, Whose blood for man did flow,
God, Who dost within us dwell,
Keep us Thine, and all is well.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
When the deep in slumber lies
Under bright and peaceful skies,
When the winds in fury rave,
Lifting high the rushing wave,
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
All our honest labor bless,
Give each lawful aim success;
In our time of need draw nigh,
Saying, “Fear not, it is I."
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
Guard the loves ones left behind,
Give them peace in heart and mind;
Keep us all in union sweet,
At our Father’s mercy seat.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.

Father, Whose everlasting love
Thy only Son for sinners gave,
Whose grace to all did freely move,
And sent Him down the world to save;
Help us Thy mercy to extol,
Immense, unfathomed, unconfined;
To praise the Lamb who died for all,
The general Savior of mankind.
Thy undistinguishing regard
Was cast on Adam’s fallen race;
For all Thou hast in Christ prepared
Sufficient, sovereign, saving grace.
The world He suffered to redeem;
For all He hath the atonement made;
For those that will not come to Him
The ransom of His life was paid.
Why then, Thou universal Love,
Should any of Thy grace despair?
To all, to all, Thy bowels move,
But straitened in our own we are.
Arise, O God, maintain Thy cause!
The fullness of the Gentiles call;
Lift up the standard of Thy cross,
And all shall own Thou diedst for all.

Father, Whose love we have wronged by transgression
Christ, Who wast nailed for our sins on the tree,
Spirit, Who givest the grace of repentance;
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Jesu, adorable Savior of sinners,
Author of penitence, Hope of our souls,
Plentiful Fountain of grace and compassion;
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Thou Who didst empty Thyself of Thy glory,
Thou Who Thy parents on earth didst obey,
Thou Who for our sake enduredst temptation,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Thou Who hast shown us the love of the Father,
Meeting with mercy the prodigal son,
Sonship and home to the lost one restoring,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Jesu, Who once by the well to the sinner
Clearly the sins of her heart did reveal,
Leading her gently to faith and repentance,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Thou Who didst enter the house of Zaccheus,
Blessing his faith and accepting his love,
When for wrongdoing he made restitution,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Christ, with the Twelve the last Passover keeping,
Ere on the cross the true Lamb should be slain,
Sacrifice offered for all and for ever,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Jesu, alone with the blood-sweat upon Thee,
Jesu, in agony bowed to the earth,
Jesu, Thy will to the Father resigning,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Jesu, from Annas to Caiaphas hurried,
Blindfolded, stricken, and falsely accused,
Rudely blasphemed, and declared a blasphemer,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Jesu, denied by Thine eager Apostle,
Whom with a look Thou didst straightway recall,
Moving him straightway to tears and contrition;
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
Thou Who wast wounded to heal our transgression,
Lifted on high to draw all men to Thee,
There on the cross in Thy majesty reigning,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
That Thou wouldst draw us to heartfelt contrition,
That Thou wouldst help us our sins to confess,
That Thou wouldst grant us the grace of amendment,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.
That we may bring forth works meet for repentance,
That we give place to the devil no more,
That Thou wouldst lead us to sure perseverance,
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.

Father, Whose will is life and good
For all of mortal breath,
Bind strong the bond of brotherhood
Of those who fight with death.
Empower the hands and hearts and wills
Of friends both near and far,
Who battle with the body’s ills
And wage Your holy war.
Where’er they heal the maimed and blind,
Let love of Christ attend:
Proclaim the good Physician’s mind,
And prove the Savior friend.
For still His love works wondrous charms,
And, as in days of old,
He takes the wounded to His arms,
And bears them to the fold.
O Father, look from Heav’n and bless
Whate’er Your servants do,
Their works of pure unselfishness,
Made consecrate to You.

Father, You alone are my reward
Father, You alone are my salvation
Even though I walk into the fire
You will shelter me with Your great love
Oh Father, I will trust in You
Oh Father, I will trust in You
Oh Your Holy Spirit comforts me
Your unfailing love restores my soul
And Your word is like a soothing fire
To refine my heart and make me whole
Oh Father, I will trust in You
Oh Father, I will trust in You
Yah, Yahwe-eh-yah, Yahwe-eh
I will trust You I will follow
Yah, Yahwe-eh-yah, Yahwe-eh

I may not be ev'ry mother's dream for her little girl
My face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world
But that's alright; as long as I can have one wish, I pray
When people look inside my life, I wanna hear them say 
She's got her father's eyes (father's eyes)
Her father's eyes (father's eyes)
Eyes that found the good in things
When good was not around
Eyes that found a source of help
When help could not be found
Eyes full of compassion (strong compassion)
Seein' everything
Knowin' what you're goin' thru
And feelin' it the same 
Just like my Father's eyes (she's got the look of Jesus)
My Father's eyes (she's got the look of Jesus)
My Father's eyes (she's got the look)
Just like my Father's eyes 
On that day when we will pay for all the deeds we have done
Good and bad they'll all be had to see by everyone
And when you're called to stand and tell just what you saw in me
More than anything I know, I want your words to be 
Just like my Father's eyes (she's got the look of Jesus)
My Father's eyes (she's got the look of Jesus)
My Father's eyes (she's got the look)
Just like my Father's eyes (she's got the look of Jesus)
My Father's eyes (she's got the look of Jesus)
My Father's eyes (she's got the look)
Just like my Father's eyes

In this modernistic day,
Some have strayed too far away
From our father’s camp meeting, praying ground;
We used to fast and pray all day,
And ask the Lord to have His way,
Back there on our father’s praying ground.
Let us go back to our father’s praying ground,
God is not pleased, let us go back on bended knees;
Too far away some have strayed,
Just now and then a soul is saved;
Let us go back to our father’s praying ground.
Through the country we would ride,
With our children by our side,
Traveling through the storm and rain just the same;
Going to the house of the Lord,
Where we would bow in sweet accord,
Singing, “Come, ye that love the Lord, in Jesus’ name." 
The old preacher could hardly read,
Still what he said sinners took heed,
And would steal away and bow down;
Sometimes beside an old oak tree,
One would cry, “He spoke peace to me,"
Just before day on our father’s praying ground.

As we sat at the table, 
Our family's heads bowed low
My thoughts returned to childhood
And the finest man I know
He doesn't speak good English
He's just a simple man
But when he's talking to the Lord
Even a little child can understand
I was young and reckless
But the thought still comes to me
When I told my dad I felt, 
I was old enough to leave.
He sat there at the table, 
And a look came on his face, 
And he never spoke another word, 
'Til he said the table grace.
He said, "Our Gracious, Heavenly Father, 
We're all gathered here today, 
To give Thee thanks for blessings, 
So humbly we pray.
My oldest son is leaving, 
But I'm sure he knows what's best; 
But just in case, would you stand by 
And help him stand the test? 
And if he gets with the wrong crowd, 
Would you let him hold your arm? 
And if he flies too high, 
Would you clip his wings? 
But don't let him fall too hard, 
I'm sure Lord, You can handle things.
I've tried by best from day to day, 
To teach him right from wrong, 
An he's grown go be a fine young man, 
And he's always blessed our home.
We pray Thee, Lord, for guidance, 
That he won't build upon sand, 
But we won't worry half as much, 
If we know he's in your hands.
And, oh, oh yes, Lord, it won't be long 
'Til I'll be coming home.
Don't make me wait too long.
We pray Thee, Lord, for guidance, 
Please cleanse us from our sins, 
So we can all be together in Heaven, 
In Jesus' name, Amen." 
The table was silent
As tears ran down my face, 
And from that day on
I based my life, 
On Father's Table Grace.

Fear not, little flock, from the cross to the throne,
From death into life He went for His own;
All power in earth, all power above,
Is given to Him for the flock of His love.
Only believe, only believe;
All things are possible, only believe,
Only believe, only believe;
All things are possible, only believe.
Fear not, little flock, He goeth ahead,
Your Shepherd selecteth the path you must tread;
The waters of Marah He’ll sweeten for thee,
He drank all the bitter in Gethsemane.
Fear not, little flock, whatever your lot,
He enters all rooms, “the doors being shut,"
He never forsakes; He never is gone,
So count on His presence in darkness and dawn.

Fear not, O little flock, the foe
Who madly seeks your overthrow;
Dread not his rage and power;
What though your courage sometimes faints?
His seeming triumph o’er God’s saints
Lasts but a little hour.
Fear not, be strong! your cause belongs
To Him Who can avenge your wrongs;
Leave all to Him, your Lord;
Though hidden yet from mortal eyes,
Salvation shall for you arise;
He girdeth on His sword!
As true as God’s own promise stands,
Not earth nor hell with all their bands
Against us shall prevail;
The Lord shall mock them from His throne;
God is with us; we are His own;
Our victory cannot fail!
Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer!
Great Captain, now thine arm make bare;
Thy church with strength defend;
So shall thy saints and martyrs raise
A joyful to Thy praise,
Through ages without end.

Fear not, thou faithful Christian flock;
God is thy shelter and thy rock;
Fear not for thy salvation.
Though fierce the foe and dark the night,
The Lord of hosts shall be thy might,
Christ thine illumination.
Arise, arise, the foe defy!
Call on the Name of God most high,
That He with might endue you.
And Christ, your everlasting Priest,
In all your conflicts shall assist,
From strength to strength renew you.

Fearless and faithful, trusting and true,
Loyal to Jesus, in all I do;
Seeking His glory, loving His laws,
Ready and willing to honor His cause.
So would I ever
Walk in His ways,
Bearing His standard,
Shouting His praise.
Fearless and faithful, strong in the Lord,
Firm as an anchor, my hope His Word;
Over the conflicts, raging within,
Victory promised thro’ grace I shall win.
Fearless and faithful, earnest in prayer,
Living for others, their burdens share;
Cheering the lowly, poor and oppressed,
Pointing to Jesus, the Giver of rest.

Since my soul is saved and sanctified,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
In this land of Canaan I'll abide,
Feasting with my Lord.
Feasting, I am feasting,
Feasting with my Lord;
I'm feasting, I am feasting,
On the living Word.
Feeding on the honey and the wine,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Gathering the clusters from the vine,
Feasting with my Lord.
Day by day we have a new supply,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
And the food is never stale or dry,
Feasting with my Lord.
Many times we have an extra spread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
When to deeper truths I have been led,
Feasting with my Lord.
Often there are only just we two,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then He tells me what He壇 have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.
If perchance the cupboard's scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord.

Hungry, Lord, for Thy Word of truth,
Sitting at my Savior’s feet;
Rising, gleaning, just like Ruth,
Feed me on the finest of the wheat.
Bread of life it is now to me,
Honey, milk and meat;
In Thy love I will ever be
Fed upon the finest of the wheat.
Work for the Master I will do,
Trusting in His strength so great;
Living in His pastures new,
Feed me on the finest of the wheat.
Then to the harvest let us go,
Bugles sounding no retreat;
Workers for Jesus, He wants you
Fed upon the finest of the wheat.

1
I put my feet on the rock
And my name on the roll
And when it’s called up yonder
I won’t worry about my soul
I know my home is waitin’
And it’s somethin’ to behold
I put my feet on the rock
And my name on the roll
Verse
I’d never heard the gospel
Spread like that before
I guess the message comes in many ways
Those simple words of wisdom
Can open Heaven’s door
So every time I get the chance I say
2
Come on, put your feet on the rock
And your name on the roll
So when it’s called up yonder
You won’t worry about your soul
You know your home is waiting
And it’s something to behold
So put your feet on the rock
And your name on the roll

Fierce raged the tempest o’er the deep,
Watch did Thine anxious servants keep
But Thou wast wrapped in guileless sleep,
Calm and still.
“Save, Lord, we perish," was their cry,
“O save us in our agony!"
Thy word above the storm rose high,
“Peace, be still."
The wild winds hushed; the angry deep
Sank, like a little child, to sleep;
The sullen billows ceased to leap,
At Thy will.
So, when our life is clouded o’er,
And storm winds drift us from the shore,
Say, lest we sink to rise no more,
“Peace, be still."

Fierce was the billow wild, dark was the night;
Oars labored heavily, foam glimmered white.
Trembled the mariners; peril was nigh:
Then said the God of God, “Peace: it is I."
Ridge of the mountain wave, lower thy crest;
Wail of the tempest wind, be thou at rest.
Sorrow can never be, darkness must fly,
Where saith the Light of light, “Peace: it is I."
Jesus, Deliverer, near to us be;
Soothe thou my voyaging over life’s sea;
Thou, when the storm of death roars, sweeping by,
Whisper, O Truth of truth, “Peace: it is I."

Fierce was the storm of wind,
The surging waves ran high,
Failed the disciples’ hearts with fear,
Tho’ Thou, their Lord, wast nigh.
But at the stern rebuke,
Of Thy almighty word,
The wind was hushed, the billows ceased,
And owned Thee God and Lord.
So now, when depths of sin,
Our souls with terrors fill,
Arise, and be our Helper, Lord,
And speak Thy “Peace, be still."
When death’s dark sea we cross,
Be with us in Thy power,
Nor let the water floods prevail
In that dread trial hour.
And, when amid the sighs,
Which speak Thine Advent near,
The roaring of the sea and waves
Fills faithless hearts with fear;
May we all undismayed
The raging tempests see,
Lift up our head and hail with joy
Thy great Epiphany.

In the hour of sore temptation I may be,
Yet, amid the trials, Jesus’ face I see;
In His word my anchor holdeth to the last,
While the fiery darts are flying thick and fast.
We shall not be wounded in the hottest fight
If we raise the shield of faith in Jesus’ might;
Through the grace of God we’ll conquer to the last,
While the fiery darts are flying thick and fast.
In the greatest suff’ring man may undergo,
He shall have the vict’ry if he’ll count it so;
Conqu’ring in the conflict, soon ’twill all be past,
Though the fiery darts are flying think and fast.
Should I walk in trouble, pressed on every side,
He who knows my weakness will with me abide;
I will ever trust Him in the hottest blast,
While the fiery darts are flying thick and fast.
In the heated furnace, Father, let me stay,
Precious gold refining, purge the dross away,
Till Thy glorious image is reflected there,
Till the costly jewels of Thy grace I wear.

Fight the good fight with all thy might;
Christ is thy Strength, and Christ thy Right;
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.
Run the straight race through God’s good grace,
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;
Life with its way before us lies,
Christ is the Path, and Christ the Prize.
Cast care aside, upon thy Guide,
Lean, and His mercy will provide;
Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its Life, and Christ its Love.
Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,
He changeth not, and thou art dear.
Only believe, and thou shalt see
That Christ is all in all to thee.

Fill all my vision, Saviour, I pray,
Let me see only Jesus today;
Though thro' the valley Thou leadest me,
Thy fadeless glory encompasseth me.
Fill all my vision, Saviour divine,
Till with Thy glory my spirit shall shine.
Fill all my vision, that all may see
Thy holy Image reflected in me.
Fill all my vision, every desire
Keep for Thy glory; my soul inspire
With Thy perfection, Thy holy love flooding
My pathway with light from above.
Fill all my vision, let naught of sin
Shadow the brightness shining within.
Let me see only Thy blessed face,
Feasting my soul on Thy infinite grace.

Hover o’er me, Holy Spirit,
Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.
Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come, and fill me now.
Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee,
Come, O come and fill me now.
I am weakness, full of weakness,
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
Fill with power and fill me now.
Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me,
Bathe, O bathe my heart and brow;
Thou art comforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now.

Will you.
Fill me up
Bread of Heaven, fill me
Enlighten me, Bright and Morning Star
Build me up, Master Builder, build me
Empower me, Mighty Great I Am
Fill me up (x4)
They throw me out on the raging sea
Swallow me up where no soul should be
Roll me 'round in the depths of hell
Sin and guilt like a prison cell
And when I've reached it, can take no more
You pull me out safely to the shore
And when I've lost all my will to stand
You lift me up with Your mighty hand
And you.
Fill me up (x(oh Lord, fill me)
They throw me down to the lions' den
Surround me 'round wicked evil men
They watch expecting my heart to faint
Listen will I deny my faith?
And when I've reached it, you give me more
You pull my out from the lions' roar
And when I've lost all my will to stand
You lift me up with Your mighty hand
And you.
And heal me up (fill me up), Great Physician, heal me
Inhabit me, Gentle Comforter (Mighty Gentle Comforter)
Use me up (use me up), Holy master, use me
Empower me, Mighty Great I Am (Mighty Great I Am)
Fill Me up (x8 with stepouts)

Fill me with Thy Spirit, Lord,
Fully save my longing soul;
Through the precious, cleansing blood
Purify and make me whole.
Come, O Spirit, seal me Thine,
Come, Thy fullness now bestow;
Let Thy glory in me shine,
Make me whiter than the snow.
Fill me with Thy holy light,
I would have a single eye;
Make me perfect in Thy sight,
’Tis Thy will to sanctify.
Fill me with Thy perfect love,
Naught of self would I retain;
Losing all Thy love to prove,
Lord, I count a happy gain.
Fill me with Thy mighty pow’r,
Father, Son, and Spirit, come;
In my soul the unction pour,
Make me ever all Thine own.
Fill me with Thy presence now,
Lord, Thyself in me reveal;
At Thy feet I humbly bow
To receive the holy seal.

Fill my house unto the fullest
Eat my bread and drink my wine
The love I bear, is held from no one
All I have and all I do I give to you
Take my time, unto the fullest
Find in me the trust you seek
Take my hands to you outreaching
All I have , and all I do , I give to you
Christ our lord with love enormous
From the cross this lesson taught
Love all men, as I have love you
All I have and all I do I give to you
Join with me, as one in Christ love
May our hearts all beat as one
May we give ourselves completely
All I have and all I do I give to you?

Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God,
In every part with praise,
That my whole being may proclaim
Thy being and Thy ways.
Not for the lip of praise alone,
Nor e’en the praising heart
I ask, but for a life made up
Of praise in every part!
Praise in the common words I speak,
Life’s common looks and tones,
In fellowship in hearth and board
With my beloved ones;
Not in the temple crowd alone
Where holy voices chime,
But in the silent paths of earth,
The quiet rooms of time.
Fill every part of me with praise;
Let all my being speak
Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
Poor though I be, and weak.
So shalt Thou, Lord, from me, e’en me,
Receive the glory due;
And so shall I begin on earth
The song forever new.
So shall each fear, each fret, each care
Be turned into a song,
And every winding of the way
The echo shall prolong;
So shall no part of day or night
From sacredness be free;
But all my life, in every step
Be fellowship with Thee.

Fill your hearts with joy and gladness,
sing and praise your God and mine!
Great the Lord in love and wisdom,
might and majesty divine!
He who framed the starry heavens
knows and names them as they shine.
Praise the Lord, his people, praise him!
wounded souls his comfort know;
those who fear him find his mercies,
peace for pain and joy for woe;
humble hearts are high exalted,
human pride and power laid low.
Praise the Lord for times and seasons,
cloud and sunshine, wind and rain;
spring to melt the snows of winter
till the waters flow again;
grass upon the mountain pastures,
golden valleys thick with grain.
Fill your hearts with joy and gladness,
peace and plenty crown your days;
love his laws, declare his judgments,
walk in all his words and ways;
he the Lord and we his children--
praise the Lord, all people, praise!

Filled with the Spirit's power with one accord
the infant church confessed its risen Lord.
O Holy Spirit, in the church today
no less your power of fellowship display.
Now with the mind of Christ set us on fire,
that unity may be our great desire.
Give joy and peace; give faith to hear your call,
and readiness in each to work for all.
Widen our love, good Spirit, to embrace
in your strong care people of every race.
Like wind and fire with life among us move,
till we are known as Christ's, and Christians prove.

Find rest, oh my soul, in God alone
My hope it comes from him
He above all is loving and strong
A warrior as well as a friend
A rock for my feet, a roof for my head
A bulwark in life's desperate hours
My salvation and my honor depend on God
Then why is my soul so downcast and anxious
I trust you at all times, pour out my heart
Bearing my soul here before you
Cause you aren't like the ones I've trusted before
When I open up
You're there all the more
Low born men are but a breath
The high born are but lie
If placed on a scale before my God
They'd amount to a breath or a sigh
We worry 'bout our position in life
So others will think we've arrived
But you love the peasant as much as the prince
Despised of men as much as the honored

Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful.
May the fire of our devotion light their way.
May the footprints that we leave
Lead them to believe
And the lives we live inspire them to obey.
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful.
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful.
May the fire of our devotion light their way.
May the footprints that we leave
Lead them to believe
And the lives we live inspire them to obey.
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful.
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful.
May the fire of our devotion light their way.
May the footprints that we leave
Lead them to believe
And the lives we live inspire them to obey.
Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful.

Finished the strife of battle now,
gloriously crowned the victor's brow:
sing with gladness, hence with sadness:
Alleluia, alleluia!
After the death that him befell,
Jesus Christ has harrowed hell:
songs of praising we are raising:
Alleluia, alleluia!
On the third morning he arose,
shining with victory o'er his foes;
earth is singing, heaven is ringing:
Alleluia, alleluia!
Lord, by your wounds on you we call:
now that from death you've freed us all:
may our living be thanksgiving:
Alleluia, alleluia!

Is the Spirit glowing in thy heart?
Oh, my brother, can you say
That you feel the burning love of God
In thy bosom day by day? 
Yes, ’tis love, ’tis burning love divine,
Filling all my soul’s desire;
Oh, how sweet its glories ever shine!
Now I feel the glowing fire.
Has the merit of the blood divine
Swept away thy sinful stain?
And does heaven’s glory in Thee shine,
Ever bright and holy flame? 
Is thy hope unclouded by a fear?
*Hallelujah! do you know [*And this moment]
That the love of God is burning clear
In thy heart as white as snow? 
Do you feel the mighty, living pow’r,
Filling all thy mortal frame?
And does all thy heart forever pour
Streams of glory to His name? 
If thy all is on the altar laid,
Guard it from each vain desire;
When thy soul the perfect price hath paid,
God will send the holy fire.

In the hour of sore temptation I may be,
Yet, amid the trials, Jesus’ face I see;
In His word my anchor holdeth to the last,
While the fiery darts are flying thick and fast.
We shall not be wounded in the hottest fight
If we raise the shield of faith in Jesus’ might;
Through the grace of God we’ll conquer to the last,
While the fiery darts are flying thick and fast.
In the greatest suff’ring man may undergo,
He shall have the vict’ry if he’ll count it so;
Conqu’ring in the conflict, soon ’twill all be past,
Though the fiery darts are flying think and fast.
Should I walk in trouble, pressed on every side,
He who knows my weakness will with me abide;
I will ever trust Him in the hottest blast,
While the fiery darts are flying thick and fast.
In the heated furnace, Father, let me stay,
Precious gold refining, purge the dross away,
Till Thy glorious image is reflected there,
Till the costly jewels of Thy grace I wear.

There stands a Rock on shores of time
That rears to Heaven its head sublime.
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest
Who find within this cleft a rest.
Some build their hopes on the ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, or their land;
Mine’s on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the “Rock of Ages."
That Rock’s a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the Rock of Ages cling.
That Rock’s a tower, whose lofty height,
Illumed with Heaven’s unclouded light,
Opes wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home.

Firmly I believe and truly
God is Three, and God is One;
And I next acknowledge duly
Manhood taken by the Son.
And I trust and hope most fully
In that Manhood crucified;
And each thought and deed unruly
Do to death, as He has died.
Simply to His grace and wholly
Light and life and strength belong,
And I love supremely, solely,
Him the holy, Him the strong.
And I hold in veneration,
For the love of Him alone,
Holy Church as His creation,
And her teachings are His own.
And I take with joy whatever
Now besets me, pain or fear,
And with a strong will I sever
All the ties which bind me here.
Adoration aye be given,
With and through the angelic host,
To the God of earth and Heaven,
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

First of martyrs, thou whose name
Doth thy golden crown proclaim,
Not of flowers that fade away
Weave we this thy crown today.
Bright the stones which bruise thee gleam
Sprinkled with thy life blood’s stream;
Stars around thy sainted head
Never could such radiance shed.
Every wound upon thy brow
Sparkles with unearthly glow;
Like an angel’s is thy face
Beaming with celestial grace.
Oh, how blessed first to be
Slain for Him Who bled for thee;
First like Him in dying hour
Witness to almighty power.
First to follow where He trod
Through the deep Red Sea of blood;
First, but in thy footsteps press
Saints and martyrs numberless.
Glory to the Father be,
Glory, Virgin Born, to Thee,
Glory to the Holy Ghost,
Praised by men and heavenly host.

Wake up Oh sinner, you're facing the darkness death
Each moment may be the moment you take your last breath
And the weight of your fears are the shackles that keep you enslaved
But the blood of the Lamb is the one way to bypass the grave.
The first step to heaven, is knowing you?re lost
The highway to Glory, is the way of the Cross
You can hand Him your burdens the moment your see
The first step to Heaven, is down on your knees.
To you believers who've answered the Good Shepherd's call
Flood the chasm of darkness with the light that can save one and all
Not a soul crosses Jordan on weight of the money or deeds
That Mansion up yonder is reserved for those who believe.
The first step to heaven, is knowing you?re lost
The highway to Glory, is the way of the Cross
You can hand Him your burdens the moment your see
The first step to Heaven, is down on your knees.
You can hand Him your burdens the moment your see
The first step to Heaven, is down on your knees.

The fish in wave, the bird on wing,
God bade the waters bear;
Each for our mortal body’s food
His gracious hands prepare.
But other food, of richer cost,
The immortal spirit needs;
By faith it lives on every word
That from His mouth proceeds.
Faith springing from the blood of Christ,
Has flowed o’er every land;
And sinners through the vanquished world
Bow down to its command.
Its light the joy of Heav’n reveals
To hearts made pure within;
And bids them seek by worthy deeds
Eternal crowns to win.
By faith the saints of old were strong
The lion’s wrath to tame;
By faith they spurned the tyrant’s threats,
And scorned the raging flame.
Lord, grant that we the path may tread
Whereon its light doth shine;
And gather, as we onward go,
The fruits of love divine.
O praise the Father; praise the Son,
On Whose most precious blood
Rests all our faith; and praise to Him
Who with Them both is God.

His pulpit's a corner on Nineteenth and Main
His grip on the Gospel his one claim to fame 
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passing by
and he offers salvation for the Savior on high.
His khakis are tattered and he ain't bathed in weeks 
his bout with the bottle shows up on his cheeks.
He looks like a scarecrow a sight to behold 
as he works for the Shepherd bringin' lambs to the fold.
He points to the Bible he holds in his hands
says, " I'm proof that the Good Lord can save any man."
Son it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear, 
material possessions won't matter up there.
And someday in heaven when the angels all sing 
these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king.
(Second verse progression same as first)
Verse II:
He's fightin' the fever in spite of the chill, 
he pulls up his collar and he speaks God's will.
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong, 
for he's filled with conviction for the mission he's on.
He knows soon in heaven He'll be homeless no more, 
As his work will soon echo from that far distant shore.

Fix my eyes on Jesus
Fix my eyes on the Lamb
Oh, on you
Never, never turn away
Never, never turn away
Never turn my eyes away from you
What we see is just a shadow
None of it will last
Hidden things are things eternal
They will never pass
Someday soon I'll see the glory
Coming from your face
On that day of revelation
I, too, will be changed

Would you lose your load of sin?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you know God's peace within?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Jesus who on the cross did die,
Jesus who lives and reigns on high,
He alone can justify;
Fix your eyes upon Jesus.
Would you calmly walk the wave?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you know His pow'r to save?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you have your cares grow light?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you songs have in the night?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you strength in weakness have?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you see beyond the grave?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus;.

Flash out the search light, dark is the way,
Some weary wand’rer is going astray,
Many temptations lurk now at his side,
Many the perils that in his path hide.
Flash out the search light, brighten the way,
Follow the souls that in darkened paths stray,
Search in the highways, search in the byways,
Tell them that Jesus bids them come home.
Flash out the search light, bright let it shine,
Bearing the message of mercy divine,
Christ the Redeemer Who seeketh for thee,
Offers a pardon so full and so free.
Light up the darkness, scatter the night,
There is a brother who longs for the light,
Now he is faltering, do not delay,
Flash out the search light and brighten the way.

Flee as a bird to your mountain, thou who art weary of sin;
Go to the clear flowing fountain where you may wash and be clean.
Haste, then, th’Avenger is near thee; call, and the Savior will hear thee;
He on His bosom will bear thee; O thou who art weary of sin,
O thou who art weary of sin.
He will protect thee forever, wipe every falling tear;
He will forsake thee, O never, sheltered so tenderly there.
Haste, then, the hours are flying, spend not the moments in sighing,
Cease from your sorrow and crying: The Savior will wipe every tear,
The Savior will wipe every tear.

Fling out the banner! let it float
Skyward and seaward, high and wide;
The sun that lights its shining folds,
The cross, on which the Savior died.
Fling out the banner! heathen lands
Shall see from far the glorious sight,
And nations crowding to be born
Baptize their spirits in its light.
Fling out the banner! angels bend
In anxious silence o’er the sight,
And vainly seek to comprehend
The wonder of the love divine.
Fling out the banner! sin sick souls
That sink and perish in the strife,
Shall touch in faith its radiant hem,
And spring immortal into life.
Fling out the banner! let it float
Skyward and seaward, high and wide,
Our glory, only in the cross;
Our only hope, the Crucified!
Fling out the banner! wide and high,
Seaward and skyward, let it shine;
Nor skill, nor might, nor merit ours;
We conquer only in that sign.

Flung to the heedless winds,
Or on the waters cast,
The martyrs’ ashes, watched,
Shall gathered be at last.
And from that scattered dust,
Around us and abroad,
Shall spring a plenteous seed,
Of witnesses for God.
The Father hath received,
Their latest living breath,
And vain is Satan’s boast,
Of victory in their death.
Still, still, though dead, they speak,
And, trumpet tongued, proclaim,
To many a wakening land,
The one availing Name.

Fling wide the door, unbar the gate;
The King of glory comes in state;
The Lord of lords and King of kings,
The Savior of the world who brings
His great salvation to the earth.
So raise a shout of holy mirth
And praise our God and Lord,
Creator, Spirit Word.
He is the rock of our belief,
The heart of mercy’s gentle self.
His kingly crown is holiness;
His scepter is his loveliness;
He brings our sorrows to an end.
Now gladly praise our king and friend,
And worship him with song,
For saving us from wrong.
O, happy towns and blessed lands
That live by their true king’s commands,
And blessed be the hearts he rules,
The humble places where he dwells.
He is the rightful Son of bliss
Who fills our lives and makes us his,
Creator of the world,
Our only strength for good.
Come, Lord, our Savior, Jesus Christ;
Our hearts are open wide in trust.
Oh, show us now your lovely grace,
Upon our sorrows shine your face,
And let your Holy Spirit guide
Our journey in your grace so wide.
We praise your holy name,
From age to age the same.

A man named Noah
Started building a big boat
He didn’t know whether
That gopher bark would float
But when the Lord says jump
You do what you must do
So Noah made the very first
Floating zoo (floating zoo)
And when the waves started rockin’
The ostriches squawkin’
There was no way to hide in the sand (hide in the sand)
And the elephants wondered
With all that thunder
Would this ship ever hit land
But forty days later
All the alligators
And the other creatures two by two (two by, two by two)
Well they opened the door
And they thanked the Lord
For the very first floating zoo
Well the neighbors laughed
At the cruise ship in the yard
And the smell those creatures left
It made living hard
When it started to pour
Well they all stood there in shock
But God shut the door
And that sea cruise started to rock (started to rock)
So when the rainbow shines
Just remember the time
And thank the Lord you knew (knew, knew)
Ol’ Noah was floatin’ (spoken)
‘Bout the great big ark
That played a part
In the very first floating zoo (floating zoo)

Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
A useful vessel let me be.
Let me touch someone in need
In Your precious Holy name
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
As You walked down the shore of Galilee
Touching blinded eyes to make them see.
As You made the lame to walk
And You caused the dumb to talk
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
A useful vessel let me be.
Let me touch someone in need
In Your precious Holy name
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
As You moved in the upper room that day,
As Your spirit fell in such a mighty way.
May we never be the same
As we call upon Your name,
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
A useful vessel let me be
Let me touch someone in need
In Your precious Holy name
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.
As the multitude was fed,
Feed me, Lord, upon Your bread
Flow through me, Holy Spirit, flow through me.

Spring has now unwrapped the flowers, day is fast reviving,
Life in all her growing powers towards the light is striving:
Gone the iron touch of cold, winter time and frost time,
Seedlings, working through the mould, now make up for lost time.
Herb and plant that, winter long, slumbered at their leisure,
Now bestirring, green and strong, find in growth their pleasure;
All the world with beauty fills, gold the green enhancing,
Flowers make glee among the hills, set the meadows dancing.
Through each wonder of fair days God Himself expresses;
Beauty follows all His ways, as the world He blesses:
So, as He renews the earth, Artist without rival,
In His grace of glad new birth we must seek revival.
Earth puts on her dress of glee; flowers and grasses hide her;
We go forth in charity—brothers all beside her;
For, as man this glory sees in th’awakening season,
Reason learns the heart’s decrees, hearts are led by reason.
Praise the Maker, all ye saints; He with glory girt you,
He Who skies and meadows paints fashioned all your virtue;
Praise Him, seers, heroes, kings, heralds of perfection;
Brothers, praise Him, for He brings all to resurrection!

Death is an angel sent down from a-bove .
Sent for the buds and the flowers we love .
Truly, 'tis so for in heaven's own way .
Each soul is a flower in the Master's Bou-quet.
Gathering flowers for the Master's Bouquet .
Beautiful flowers that will never de-cay .
Gathered by angels and carried a-way .
Forever to bloom in the Master's Bou-quet.
Loved ones are passing each day and each hour
Passing away as the life of a flower
But ev'ry bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as a flower in the Master's Bouquet.
Let us be faithful till life's work is done
Blooming with love till the reaper shall come
Then we'll be gathered together for, (*Ay)
Transplanted to bloom in the Master's Bouquet.

Flung to the heedless winds
Or on the waters cast,
The martyrs' ashes, watched,
Shall gathered be at last.
And from that scattered dust,
Around us and abroad,
Shall spring a plenteous seed
Of witnesses for God.
The Father hath received
Their latest living breath,
And vain is Satan's boast
Of victory in their death.
Still, still, though dead, they speak,
And, trumpet-tongued, proclaim
To many a wakening land
The one availing Name.

Follow me, follow me
My disciple ever be
Follow me, follow me
My disciple you will ever be
Jesus was walkin down by the sea
When He saw these fishers, and said "Come follow me"
Well there was Peter, and there was James and John
And there was Andrew, they were all fishermen's sons
Then right there they dropped their nets
Never again to look back
Jesus was walkin through the marketplace
When He looked up and saw Matthew's face
He was the tax man, and he was hated by all
But then he stood up, and he heeded the call
He left that table standing there
Never again to look back
(Follow me, follow me)
(Follow me, follow me) Jesus is livin, and He's callin for you
(Follow me, follow me) So listen to Him, be born and made anew
(Follow me, follow me) He is comin, again in clouds one day
(Follow me, follow me) So follow Jesus, and His will obey
(Follow me) Begin new life, be born again
(Follow me, follow me) Don't look back, don't look back

“Follow Me!" A call so tender
Falls upon my list’ning ear;
’Tis the voice of Christ, my Savior,
’Tis the Shepherd’s call I hear.
O that call! Loving call!
’Tis the sweetest voice of all.
How it draws me nearer to Him
When I hear my Shepherd’s call!
Into pastures green He leadeth,
His own sheep He calls by name;
When their feet are sore and weary,
In His arms He carries them.
Little flock, fear not! He shields thee
From the dangers of the land.
Hear His promise: None shall ever
Pluck thee from His mighty hand.
In His steps, then, I would follow,
Seek in Him my all in all;
I am safe, whate’er befalls me,
When I heed His tender call.

“Follow Me," the Master said;
We will follow Jesus:
By His Word and Spirit led,
We will follow Jesus.
Still for us He lives to plead,
At the throne doth intercede,
Offers help in time of need:
We will follow Jesus.
Should the world and sin oppose,
We will follow Jesus:
He is greater than our foes,
We will follow Jesus.
On His promise we depend;
He will succor and defend,
Help and keep us to the end:
We will follow Jesus.
Tho’ the way may dark appear,
We will follow Jesus:
He will make our pathway clear,
We will follow Jesus.
In our daily round of care,
As we plead with God in prayer,
With the cross which we must bear,
We will follow Jesus.
Ever keep the end in view;
We will follow Jesus:
All His promises are true:
We will follow Jesus.
When this earthly course is run,
And the Master says, “Well done!"
Life eternal we’ll have won!
We will follow Jesus.

Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,
Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!
Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,
Danger cannot fright me if my Lord is near.
Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Savior would my soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,
Up to where they gather on the hills of God.

To the knights in the days of old,
Keeping watch on the mountain height,
Came a vision of Holy Grail
And a voice through the waiting night:
Follow, follow, follow the gleam;
Banners unfurled o’er all the world;
Follow, follow, follow the gleam
Of the chalice that is the Grail.
And we who would serve the King,
And loyally Him obey,
In the consecrate silence know
That the challenge still holds today,
Follow, follow, follow the gleam
Standards of worth o’er all the earth;
Follow, follow, follow the gleam
Of the Light that shall bring the dawn.

Following Jesus day by day,
Following Him—His will obey,
Following Him, I cannot stray,
I’ll follow Him all the way.
Following Him, following Him,
Following Him by night and by day;
Following Him, following Him,
I’ll follow Him all the way.
Following Him through all the night,
Following Him into the light,
Following Him, ’tis always right,
I’ll follow Him all the way.
Following Him through joy or woe,
Following Him, in grace to grow,
Following Him, His love to know,
I’ll follow Him all the way.

Following Jesus, following Jesus,
Gently He leads me in the heavenly way;
Watching and praying, trusting, obeying,
He will restrain me from going astray.
Following Jesus, following Jesus,
Following Jesus by day and by night;
Watching and praying, trusting, obeying,
He is my helper in doing the right.
Following Jesus, following Jesus,
He who has suffered to redeem me from sin;
Oh, what a blessing, while I'm confessing,
He in His fullness is reigning within.
Following Jesus, following Jesus,
I am delighted with His wonderful love;
While I'm confiding, in Him I'm hiding,
Soon I shall meet Him in heaven above.
Following Jesus, following Jesus,
This is my duty for His goodness to me;
Joyful in glory, telling the story,
How in His favor I'm happy and free.

Fools in their heart believe and say,
“That all religion’s vain;
There is no God that reigns on high,
Or minds th’affairs of men."
From thoughts so dreadful and profane,
Corrupt discourse proceeds;
And in their impious hands are found
Abominable deeds.
The Lord from His celestial throne
Looked down on things below,
To find the man that sought His grace,
Or did His justice know.
By nature all are gone astray,
Their practice all the same;
There’s none that fears his Maker’s hand;
There’s none that loves His Name.
Their tongues are used to speak deceit,
Their slanders never cease;
How swift to mischief are their feet,
Nor know the paths of peace!
Such seeds of sin—that bitter root—
In every heart are found;
Nor can they bear diviner fruit
Till grace refine the ground.

Fools in their heart have said,
There is no God of might;
Corrupt are they and base their deeds,
In evil they delight.
God looked from Heav’n above
On all the human race
To see if any understood,
If any sought His face.
They all are gone aside,
Corruption doth abound;
There is not one that doeth good,
Not even one is found.
These men of evil deeds
Will they no knowledge gain,
Who feed upon my people’s woes
And prayer to God disdain?
The day is drawing nigh
When they shall fear and quail
For God shall scatter and destroy
Those who His saints assail.
Yea, God will put to shame
And make them flee away,
For He will cast them off in wrath
And fill them with dismay.
O would that Zion’s help
Were out of Zion come!
O would that God might early bring
His captive people home!
When God from distant lands
His exiled ones shall bring,
His people shall exultant be,
And gladly they shall sing.

The dream I had last night
Was an example of love
I dreamt I walked on the seashore
Side by side with my Lord Jesus Christ
And as we walked on the shore
The Lord began to show me
Scenes I’d long forgotten
Of all I’ve been through in this life
I saw them again on a screen
Scenes of the happy moments
When there was plenty
On my table at supper
Wherever I walked I could see
Two sets of footprints on the shore
And then the Lord told me:
“In the beautiful moments of life
To guide you in all your steps
I was always there by your side."
And then my lack of faith
Had to ruin everything
When scenes of the saddest moments
In all of my life were shown to me
Then to the Lord I complained
I saw just one set of footprints
“When I needed You most
When I suffered and cried
You abandoned me!"
And then in that holy moment
The Lord embraced me
And told me like this:
“I wore a crown of thorns
I died on a cross and you still doubt Me!
Son these footprints are Mine
Listen to what I will say
In your hours of pain
I had you in My arms all the way!" 

Sweetly, Lord, have we heard Thee calling,
Come, follow Me!
And we see where Thy footprints falling
Lead us to Thee.
Footprints of Jesus,
That make the pathway glow;
We will follow the steps of Jesus
Where’er they go.
Though they lead o’er the cold, dark mountains,
Seeking His sheep;
Or along by Siloam’s fountains,
Helping the weak.
If they lead through the temple holy,
Preaching the Word;
Or in homes of the poor and lowly,
Serving the Lord.
Though, dear Lord, in Thy pathway keeping,
We follow Thee;
Through the gloom of that place of weeping,
Gethsemane!
If Thy way and its sorrows bearing,
We go again,
Up the slope of the hillside, bearing
Our cross of pain.
By and by, through the shining portals,
Turning our feet,
We shall walk, with the glad immortals,
Heav’n’s golden street.
Then at last when on high He sees us,
Our journey done,
We will rest where the steps of Jesus
End at His throne.

Sweetly, Lord, have we heard Thee calling,
Come, follow Me!
And we see where Thy footprints falling
Lead us to Thee.
Footprints of Jesus,
That make the pathway glow;
We will follow the steps of Jesus
Where'er they go.
Though they lead o'er the cold, dark mountains,
Seeking His sheep;
Or along by Siloam's fountains,
Helping the weak.
Footprints of Jesus,
That make the pathway glow;
We will follow the steps of Jesus
Where'er they go.
If they lead through the temple holy,
Preaching the Word;
Or in homes of the poor and lowly,
Serving the Lord.
Footprints of Jesus,
That make the pathway glow;
We will follow the steps of Jesus
Where'er they go.
Though, dear Lord, in Thy pathway keeping,
We follow Thee;
Through the gloom of that place of weeping,
Gethsemane! 

For a worldwide revival,
Blessed Master, we pray.
Let the pow’r of the Highest
Be upon us today;
For this world, dearly purchased
By the blood of God’s Son,
Back from Satan’s dominion
And from sin must be won.
Send the power, O Lord,
Send the power, O Lord.
Send the Holy Ghost power;
Let it now be outpoured.
Send it surging and sweeping
Like the waves of the sea.
Send a worldwide revival,
And begin it in me.
Send the “showers of blessing,"
As declared in Thy Word,
Let the “Spirit of promise"
On all flesh be outpoured;
Send the “latter rain" on us,
Till the land overflows,
Till the desert, rejoicing,
Blossoms forth as the rose.
There’s a “sound of a going
In the mulberry trees,"
News of nations awaking
Borne upon ev’ry breeze;
For the prayers of His children,
God in mercy doth own.
The revival’s beginning,
And the power’s coming down.

For all the blessings of the year,
For all the friends we hold so dear,
For peace on earth, both far and near,
We thank Thee, Lord.
For life and health, those common things,
Which every day and hour brings,
For home, where our affection clings,
We thank Thee, Lord.
For love of Thine, which never tires,
Which all our better thought inspires,
And warms our lives with heavenly fires,
We thank Thee, Lord.

For all the Lord has done for me,
I never will cease to love Him;
And for His grace so rich and free,
I never will cease to love Him.
I never will cease to love Him,
My Savior, my Savior;
I never will cease to love Him,
He’s done so much for me.
He gives me strength for every day,
I never will cease to love Him;
He leads and guides me all the way,
I never will cease to love Him.
Though all the world His love neglect,
I never will cease to love Him;
I could not such a Friend reject,
I never will cease to love Him.
While on my journey here below,
I never will cease to love Him;
And when to that bright world I go,
I never will cease to love Him.

For all the saints, who from their labors rest,
Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
Thy Name, O Jesus, be forever blessed.
Alleluia, Alleluia! 
Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their Might;
Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well fought fight;
Thou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
For the Apostles’ glorious company,
Who bearing forth the Cross o’er land and sea,
Shook all the mighty world, we sing to Thee:
Alleluia, Alleluia!
For the Evangelists, by whose blest word,
Like fourfold streams, the garden of the Lord,
Is fair and fruitful, be Thy Name adored.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
For Martyrs, who with rapture kindled eye,
Saw the bright crown descending from the sky,
And seeing, grasped it, Thee we glorify.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
O blest communion, fellowship divine!
We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
All are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
And win with them the victor’s crown of gold.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
And hearts are brave, again, and arms are strong.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
The golden evening brightens in the west;
Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;
Sweet is the calm of paradise the blessed.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
The King of glory passes on His way.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
From earth’s wide bounds, from ocean’s farthest coast,
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
And singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost:
Alleluia, Alleluia!

For all Thy saints, a noble throng,
Who fell by fire and sword,
Who soon were called, or waited long,
We praise Thy Name, O Lord!
For him who left his father’s side,
Nor lingered by the shore,
When, softer than the weltering tide,
Thy summons glided o’er.
Who stood beside the maiden dead,
Who climbed the mount with Thee,
And saw the glory round Thy head,
One of Thy chosen three.
Who knelt beneath the olive shade,
Who drank Thy cup of pain,
And passed from Herod’s flashing blade
To see Thy face again.
Lord, give us grace, and give us love,
Like him to leave behind
Earth’s cares and joys, and look above
With true and earnest mind.
So shall we learn to drink Thy cup,
So meek and firm be found,
When Thou shalt come to take us up
Where Thine elect are crowned.

For all thy saints, 0 Lord,
our grateful hymn receive,
who followed thee.obeyed, adored,
and strove in thee to live.
For all thy saints, 0 Lord, 
accept our thankful cry,
who counted thee their great reward,
who strove in thee to die.
Thine earthly members fit 
to join thy saints above,
in one communion ever knit,
one fellowship of love.
Jesus, thy name we bless, 
and humbly pray that we
may follow them in holiness
and live and die in thee.
All might, all praise, be thine,
Father, co-equal Son,
and Spirit, bond of love divine,
while endless ages run.

For all your blessings,
Jesus, we praise you,
gracious in mercy,
strong to console.
You to our need bring 
comfort and healing,
love and forgiveness,
making us whole.
Daily around us,
pain and confusion
crumble our feeble
faith into dust.
Yet still we find your
love in the darkness,
changing our anxious
thoughts into trust.
We carry with us
into your presence
prisoners of sickness,
sadness, and fear;
grant them to know your
peace in their suffering
and new life flowing,
for you are near.
Grant us, your servants,
grace to work with you,
that in your loving
task we may share
mind's understanding,
hands skilled for healing,
hearts of compassion,
joined in love's care.

My Savior, Redeemer
Lifted my from the miry clay
Almighty, Forever
I will never be the same
'Cause you came near
From the everlasting
To the world we live
The Father's only son
And you lived and you died
And you rose again on high
And you opened the way
For the world to live again
Hallelujah, for all you've done

For ever we would gaze on Thee,
O Lord, upon the Mount;
With Moses and Elias see
That light from Light’s own Fount;
For ever with the chosen three
Would stand upon that height,
And in that blessed company
Be plunged in pure delight.
For ever would we train the ear
To that celestial Voice;
In Thee, the Son of God, so near
For evermore rejoice.
Here would we pitch our constant tent,
For ever here abide;
And dwell in peace and full content,
Dear Master, at Thy side.
But no! not yet to man ’tis given
To rest upon that height;
’Tis but a passing glimpse of Heav’n;
We must descend and fight.
Beneath the Mount is toil and pain;
O Christ, Thy strength impart;
Till we, transfigured, too, shall reign
For ever where Thou art.

"For ever with the Lord!"
Amen; so let it be:
Life from the dead is in that word,
'Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day's march nearer home.
My Father's house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith's foreseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear!
Ah! then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.
"For ever with the Lord!"
Father, if 'tis thy will,
The promise of that faithful word
Even here to me fulfil.
Be thou at my right hand,
Then can I never fail;
Uphold thou me, and I shall stand,
Fight, and I must prevail.
So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
How shall I love that word,
And oft "For ever with the Lord!"

A story sweet and wondrous,
Like heav’nly music swells;
In chimings clear to all who will hear,
Ring out the Gospel bells.
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only begotten Son,
That whosoever believeth in Him,
Whosoever believeth in Him
Should not perish,
Should not perish,
But have everlasting life.
When, grieving, brokenhearted,
Because of sin and shame,
We find a joy earth cannot destroy,
Believing on His Name.
This love beyond all measure
Of earth or sea or sky,
Could only show its full overflow,
When Jesus came to die.
Come, brother, come to Jesus;
His Word was meant for you;
His grace receive, His promise believe,
And sing His praise anew.

For God so loved this sinful world,
His Son He freely gave,
That whosoever would believe
Eternal life should have.
’Tis true, O yes, ’tis true,
God’s wonderful promise is true;
For I’ve trusted, and tested, and tried it,
And I know God’s promise is true.
I was a wayward, wand’ring child,
A slave to sin and fear,
Until this blessed promise fell
Like music on my ear.
The “whosoever" of the Lord,
I trusted was for me,
I took Him at His gracious word;
From sin He set me free.
Eternal life, begun below,
Now fills my heart and soul.
I’ll sing His praise forevermore
Who has redeemed my soul.

When I heard of salvation and of reconciliation
I decided I would change my ol' ways (I decided I would change my ol' ways)
Yes, I fully repented adn I made a real commitment
That will last me for the rest of my days (for the rest of my days)
Oh, I don't mind when I'm givin' Him my time
Yes, I'll do it 'til the day that I'm dead
When I live for Him, brother, I'll not take to any other
'Cause I'm livin' for Jesus instead 
For Jesus instead (I've been livin')
For Jesus instead
For Jesus instead (I've been livin')
For Jesus instead
For Jesus instead (I've been livin')
For Jesus instead
For Jesus instead (I've been livin')
For Jesus instead 
Well, the way I've been livin' and the work that I've been givin'
I've been doing it all for the Son (I've been doing it all for the Son)
And when times were a testin' and when Satan started pressin'
I decided that I wouldn't run (no, I didn't frown)
No, I didn't frown when ol' Satan came around
I just stuck by my guns and I said,
"You must be mistaken and you sin I'm not a-takin'
'Cause I'm livin' for Jesus intead" 
For Jesus instead 
Well if you life's a revival and you're readin' your Bible
And you're trustin' in God as your friend (trustin' in God as your friend)
If you're sharin' the message and to people you're a blessin'
And the Spirit is livin' within (well, you don't care)
Well, you don't care when the people start to share
And to say that you're out of your head
It'll never get to you when ol' Satan tries to fool you
'Cause you're livin' for Jesus instead 
I've been livin', yes I'm livin'
I've been livin' for Jesus instead 

I know that you're there when I cry
With every heart beat you're there by my side
All that I am I give to you
For I know that you will break through
I give you my heart for I know that you
You're for me
I know that you're for me
Oh you are for me
I know that you're for me
I know that you're there when I call
Your love to surround me your grace to restore
All that I am.

No sigh nor a tear since my Jesus is here,
In His presence securely I dwell;
I hear His sweet voice, and it makes me rejoice,
I know that for me all is well.
’Tis well with my soul since the Lord made me whole,
And His smiles all my sorrows dispel;
On His bosom I rest, in His love I am blest;
I know that for me all is well.
I sit at His feet, and my joy is complete,
He gives me this message to tell:
Oh, lean on His arm, He will save from all harm,
And fit you in heaven to dwell.
Oh, yield to Him now, and in lowliness bow,
And drink from this life-giving well;
The taste is so sweet, and the joy so complete,
Its pleasure we never can tell.
And when by and by He descends from on high,
He will take us to heaven to dwell;
We’ll sing this glad song as we journey along,
I know that for me all is well.

For me to live Is Jesus.
To die is gain for me;
Then, whensoe'er He pleases,
I meet death willingly.
For Christ, my Lord and Brother,
I leave this world so dim
And gladly seek that other,
Where I shall be with Him.
My woes are nearly over,
Though long and dark the road;
My sin His merits cover,
And I have peace with God.
Lord, when my powers are failing,
My breath comes heavily,
And words are unavailing.
Oh, hear my sighs to Thee! 
When mind and thought, 0 Savior,
Are flickering like a light
That to and fro doth waver
Ere 'tis extinguished quite, 
In that last hour, oh, grant me
To slumber soft and still,
No doubts to vex or haunt me,
Safe anchored on Thy will; 
And so to Thee still cleaving
Through all death's agony,
To fall asleep believing
And wake in heaven with Thee.
8.Amen! Thou, Christ, my Savior.
Wilt grant this unto me.
Thy Spirit lead me ever
That I fare happily.

“For My sake, and the Gospel’s, go
And tell redemption’s story";
His heralds answer, “Be it so,
And Thine, Lord, all the glory!"
They preach His birth, His life, His cross,
The love of His atonement,
For Whom they count the world but loss,
His Easter, His enthronement.
Hark, hark, the trump of jubilee
Proclaims to every nation,
From pole to pole, by land and sea,
Glad tidings of salvation;
As nearer draws the day of doom,
While still the battle rages,
The heav’nly Dayspring through the gloom
Breaks on the night of ages.
Still on and on the anthems spread
Of alleluia voices,
In concert with the holy dead
The warrior church rejoices;
Their snow white robes are washed in blood,
Their golden harps are ringing;
Earth and the paradise of God
One triumph song are singing.
He comes, Whose advent trumpet drowns
The last of time’s evangels,
Emmanuel crowned with many crowns,
The Lord of saints and angels;
O Life, Light, Love, the great I AM,
Triune, Who changest never,
The throne of God and of the Lamb
Is Thine, and Thine forever.

Abraham.Here I am Lord
Take now your son
Your only son 
The one you love, Isaac 
Go to the land of Moriah
To offer him there
Burn him as a sacrifice to Me
Burn him as a sacrifice to Me
Father.Here I am son
I have the wood
You have the fire
But where’s the lamb to offer?
The Lord will provide the lamb my son
To burn as a sacrifice for Him
To burn as a sacrifice for Him 
For My ways are not your ways, Abraham
Sacrifice brings blessings more than pain
I swear by Myself
Because you have done this thing
And not withheld your son, your only son
I will greatly bless you
Your descendants shall possess
The gates of their enemies
Every nation will be blessed because of you
O’ My child.Here I am Lord 
Take now your future Your world, your life
The things you love, your treasure
And though you may bleed
Cut them loose and set them free
Burn them as a sacrifice to Me
Burn them as a sacrifice to Me

For sacrifice or service,
We stand in readiness
To do Thy bidding, Master,
With joy and faithfulness;
It matters not what Thou shoudst ask,
We’ll serve Thee willingly;
So help us, give us strength and grace
To labor on for Thee.
Thy call we’ve heard, O Master,
And hast’ning to obey,
We rally ’round Thy standard,
We’re ready for the fray!
Behold! the battle is begun,
The host of sin must flee:
For Thou, O Lord, our Captain, art
Assuring victory! 
We pray Thee, blessed Master,
Endue us with Thy pow’r;
Without Thee we are helpless,
Supply our needs each hour;
Resolved we are to faithful prove,
Devoted, Lord, and true:
In sacrifice or service, we
Thy will indeed will do.

For salvation full and free,
Purchased once on Calvary,
Christ alone shall be my plea—
Jesus! Jesus only.
Jesus only, let me see,
Jesus only, none save He,
Then my song shall ever be—
Jesus! Jesus only!
He my Guide from day to day,
As I journey on life’s way;
Close beside Him let me stay—
Jesus! Jesus only.
May my model ever be
Christ the Lord, and none save He,
That the world may see in me
Jesus! Jesus only.
He shall reign from shore to shore,
His the glory evermore—
Heav’n and earth shall bow before
Jesus! Jesus only.

For the beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies,
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies.
Lord of all, to Thee we raise,
This our hymn of grateful praise.
For the beauty of each hour,
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flower,
Sun and moon, and stars of light.
For the joy of ear and eye,
For the heart and mind’s delight,
For the mystic harmony
Linking sense to sound and sight.
For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parent, child,
Friends on earth and friends above,
For all gentle thoughts and mild.
For Thy Church, that evermore
Lifteth holy hands above,
Offering up on every shore
Her pure sacrifice of love.
For the martyrs’ crown of light,
For Thy prophets’ eagle eye,
For Thy bold confessors’ might,
For the lips of infancy.
For Thy virgins’ robes of snow,
For Thy maiden mother mild,
For Thyself, with hearts aglow,
Jesu, Victim undefiled.
For each perfect gift of Thine,
To our race so freely given,
Graces human and divine,
Flowers of earth and buds of Heaven.

For the bread, which Thou hast broken;
For the wine, which Thou hast poured;
For the words, which Thou hast spoken—
Now we give Thee thanks, O Lord.
By this pledge that Thou dost love us,
By Thy gift of peace restored,
By Thy call to Heaven above us,
Hallow all our lives, O Lord.
With our sainted ones in glory,
Seated at our Father’s board,
May the Church that waiteth for Thee
Keep love’s tie unbroken, Lord.
In Thy service, Lord, defend us,
In our hearts keep watch and ward;
In the world where Thou dost send us
Let Thy kingdom come, O Lord.

I will love you for the Cross
And I will love you for the cost
Man of sufferings, bringer of my peace.
You came into a world of shame
And paid the price we could not pay
Death that brought me life,
Blood that brought me home.
Death that brought me life, 
Blood that brought me home.
And I love you for the cross,
I'm overwhelmed by the mystery,
I love you for the cross,
That Jesus you would do this for me.
When you were broken, you were beaten,
You were punished, I go free,
When you were wounded and rejected,
In Your mercy, I am healed.
Jesus Christ the sinner's Friend
Does this kindness know no bounds?
With your precious blood you have purchased me.
O, the mystery of the cross
You were punished, you were crushed
But that punishment has become my peace
Yes, that punishment has become my peace.

For the dear ones parted from us
We would raise our hymns of prayer;
By the tender love which watcheth
Round Thy children everywhere,
Holy Father, Holy Father,
Keep them ever in Thy care.
Through each trial and temptation,
Dangers faced by night and day,
By the infinite compassion
Pleading for souls that stray,
Loving Savior, Loving Savior,
Keep them in the narrow way.
In their hours of doubt and sorrow,
When their faith is sorely tried,
By the grace divine which strengthens,
Souls for whom the Savior died,
Gracious Spirit, Gracious Spirit,
Be Thou evermore their Guide.
In their joys, by friends surrounded,
In their strife, by foes oppressed,
May Thy blessing still be with them,
May Thy presence give them rest,
God Almighty, God Almighty,
Father, Son, and Spirit blest.

For the deep love that kept us through the night,
And gave our senses to sleep’s gentle sway;
For this new wonder of morning’s dawning light,
Flushing the east with prophecies of day,
We thank Thee, O our God.
For the fresh life that through our being flows,
With its full tide to enrich and to bless;
For calm, sweet thoughts, upspringing from repose,
To bear to Thee our song of thankfulness,
We praise Thee, O our God.
Day utters speech to day, and night to night
Tells of Thy glory and power.So would we
Thy children, duly, with morning’s golden light,
Or still at eve, upon the bended knee,
Adore Thee, O our God.
Thou knowest our needs, Thy fullness will supply;
Our blindness, Thy hand will still lead us on;
Till we shall see the Dayspring from on high,
Our prayer, one only, “Let Thy will be done,"
We breathe to Thee, O God.

For the fruit of all creation,
thanks be to God.
gifts bestowed on every nation,
thanks be to God.
For the plowing, sowing, reaping,
silent growth while we are sleeping,
future needs in earth's safekeeping,
thanks be to God.
In the just reward of labor,
God's will is done.
In the help we give our neighbor,
God's will is done.
In our worldwide task of caring
for the hungry and despairing,
in the harvests we are sharing,
God's will is done.
For the harvests of the Spirit,
thanks be to God.
For the good we all inherit,
thanks be to God.
For the wonders that astound us,
for the truths that still confound us,
most of all that love has found us,
thanks be to God.

For the healing of the nations,
Lord, we pray with one accord,
for a just and equal sharing
of the things that earth affords.
To a life of love in action
help us rise and pledge our word.
Lead us forward into freedom,
from despair your world release,
that, redeemed from war and hatred,
all may come and go in peace.
Show us how through care and goodness
fear will die and hope increase.
All that kills abundant living,
let it from the earth be banned:
pride of status, race or schooling,
dogmas that obscure your plan.
In our common quest for justice
may we hallow brief life's span.
You, Creator God, have written
your great name on humankind;
for our growing in your likeness
bring the life of Christ to mind;
that by our response and service
earth its destiny may find.

For the Lord is marching on
And His army is ever strong
And His glory shall be seen upon our land
Raise the anthem, sing the victor's song
Praise the Lord for the battle's won
No weapon formed against us shall stand
For the Captain of the host is Jesus
We're following in His footsteps
No foe can stand against us in the fray (2x)
We are marching in Messiah's band
The keys of vict'ry in His mighty hand
Let us march on to take our promised land
For the Lord is marching on
And His army is ever strong
And His glory shall be seen upon our land.

For the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God;
thou hast kept thy pilgrim people by the strength of thy staff and rod;
thou hast called us to the journey which faithless feet ne'er trod;
for the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.
For the love of Christ constraining, that bound their hearts as one; 
for the faith in truth and freedom in which their work was done;
for the peace of God's evangel wherewith their feet were shod;
for the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.
We are watchers of a beacon whose light must never die;
we are guardians of an altar that shows thee ever nigh;
we are children of thy freemen who sleep beneath the sod;
for the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.
May the shadow of thy presence around our camp be spread; 
baptize us with the courage thou gavest to our dead;
0 keep us in the pathway their saintly feet have trod;
for the might of thine arm we bless thee, our God, our fathers' God.

“Of one blood God hath made all the nations of the earth,"
Over all His banner wide unfurled;
And He bids us to go and His saving grace proclaim
To the whole wide world.
For the whole wide world,
For the whole wide world;
Jesus dying bro’t a full salvation
For the whole wide world.
To the lanes and the highways and byways we must go,
Till the pow’rs of sin are backward hurled;
And the streams of His grace shall for cleansing onward flow
To the whole wide world.
We must carry the Gospel to earth’s remotest bound,
Men are dying for the precious Word;
Until ev’ry nation has heard the joyful sound
In the whole wide world.

For thee, O dear, dear country,
Mine eyes their vigils keep;
For very love, beholding
Thy happy name, they weep.
The mention of thy glory
Is unction to the breast
And medicine in sickness
And love and life and rest.
O one, O only mansion,
O paradise of joy,
Where tears are ever banished
And smiles have no alloy!
The Lamb is all thy splendor,
The Crucified thy praise;
His laud and benediction
Thy ransomed people raise.
With jasper glow thy bulwarks,
Thy streets with emeralds blaze;
The sardis and the topaz
Unite in thee their rays;
Thine ageless walls are bonded
With amethyst unpriced;
The saints build up thy fabric,
The cornerstone is Christ.
Thou hast no shore, fair ocean;
Thou hast no time, bright day,
Dear fountain of refreshment
To pilgrims far away!
Upon the Rock of Ages
They raise thy holy tower;
Thine is the victor’s laurel
And thine the golden dower.
O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God’s elect!
O sweet and blessed country,
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus, in mercy bring us,
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father,
And Spirit, ever blest.

For Thee, O God, our constant praise
In Zion waits, Thy chosen seat;
Our promised altars we will raise,
And there our zealous vows complete.
O Thou, Who to my humble prayer
Didst always bend Thy listening ear,
To Thee shall all mankind repair,
And at Thy gracious throne appear.
Our sins, though numberless, in vain,
To stop Thy flowing mercy try;
Whilst Thou o’erlook’st the guilty stain,
And washest out the crimson dye.
Blest is the man, who, near Thee placed,
Within Thy sacred dwelling lies!
While we, at humbler distance, taste
The vast delights Thy temple gives.

For this New Year we humbly ask Your grace;
Help us to always see Your loving face
Shining upon us, bringing peace within,
Keeping our feet from paths of mortal sin.
Dear Lord, we ask that we would always be
Open to You, and that all men may see
In how we treat them that we’ve made a pact.
To let Your love shine through our ev’ry act.
Within our fam’lies may we know Your peace;
As we share moments let our love increase.
Teach us to share with those we truly love
As we would do so in that home above.
Now for Your church, Lord, we would give You thanks,
All kinds of people making up her ranks;
Help her be true in all she longs to do
That ev’ry act shall praise and honor You.
For this Your world, dear Lord, we beg You now
Beat ev’ry sword blade into humble plow;
We seek that peace that we can help to bring
When we acknowledge You as Lord and King.
For me, O Lord, this too I simply ask;
Help me to not shirk my appointed task,
Teach me to trust, Lord, walking day by day,
In simple faith that You show me Your way.

You said You'd come and share all my sorrows,
You said You'd be there for all my tomorrows;
I came so close to sending You away,
But just like You promised You came there to stay;
I just had to pray!
And Jesus said, "Come to the water, stand by My side,
I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied;
I felt ev'ry teardrop when in darkness you cried,
And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died."
Your goodness so great I can't understand,
And, dear Lord, I know that all this was planned;
I know You're here now, and always will be,
Your love loosed my chains and in You I'm free;
But Jesus, why me?
And Jesus said, "Come to the water, stand by My side,
I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied;
I felt ev'ry teardrop when in darkness you cried,
And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died."
Jesus, I give You my heart and my soul,
I know that without God I'd never be whole;
Savior, You opened all the right doors,
And I thank You and praise You from earth's humble shores;
Take me, I'm Yours.
And Jesus said, "Come to the water, stand by My side,
I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied;
I felt ev'ry teardrop when in darkness you cried,
And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died."

For those we love within the veil,
Who once were comrades of our way,
We thank Thee, Lord; for they have won
To cloudless day.
And life for them is life indeed,
The splendid goal of earth’s strait race;
And where no shadows intervene
They see Thy face.
Not as we knew them any more,
Toil worn, and sad with burdened care:
Erect, clear eyed, upon their brows
Thy Name they bear.
Free from the fret of mortal years,
And knowing now Thy perfect will,
With quickened sense and heightened joy,
They serve Thee still.
O fuller, sweeter is that life,
And larger, ampler is the air:
Eye cannot see nor heart conceive
The glory there;
Nor know to what high purpose Thou
Dost yet employ their ripened powers,
Nor how at Thy behest they touch
This life of ours.
There are no tears within their eyes;
With love they keep perpetual tryst;
And praise and work and rest are one
With Thee, O Christ.

For Thy dear saints, O Lord,
[or, For Thy dear saint, O Lord,]
Who strove in Thee to live,
Who followed Thee, obeyed, adored,
Our grateful hymn receive.
They all in life and death,
With Thee their Lord in view,
Learned from Thy Holy Spirit’s breath
To suffer and to do.
Thine earthly members fit
To join Thy saints above,
In one communion ever knit,
One fellowship of love.
Jesus, Thy Name we bless,
And humbly pray that we
May follow them in holiness,
Who lived and died for Thee.

For Thy Gift of God the Spirit,
With us, in us, e'er to be,
Pledge of life and Hope of glory,
Saviour, we would worship Thee.
He who in Creation's dawning,
Brooded o'er the pathless deep,
Still across our nature's darkness
Moves to wake our souls from sleep.
Moves to stir, to draw, to quicken;
Thrusts us thro' with sense of sin;
Then, Himself, the Pledge,
He seals us— Saving Advocate within.
He, the mighty God, indwells us:
His to strengthen, help, empow'r;
His to overcome the Tempter—
Ours to call in danger's hour.
He it is, the Living Author,
Wakes to life the sacred Word;
Reads with us its holy pages,
And reveals our risen Lord.
He it is who works within us,
Teaching rebel hearts to pray;
He whose holy intercessions
Rise for us both night and day.

For Thy mercy and Thy grace,
Constant through another year,
Hear our song of thankfulness;
Jesus, our Redeemer, hear.
Lo! our sins on Thee we cast,
Thee, our perfect Sacrifice;
And, forgetting all the past,
Press towards our glorious prize.
Dark the future: let Thy light
Guide us, bright and morning Star:
Fierce our foes, and hard the fight;
Arm us, Savior, for the war.
In our weakness and distress,
Rock of strength, be Thou our Stay;
In the pathless wilderness
Be our true and living Way.
Who of us death’s awful road
In the coming year shall tread?
With Thy rod and staff, O God,
Comfort Thou his dying bed.
Keep us faithful, keep us pure,
Keep us evermore Thine own;
Help, O help us to endure;
Fit us for the promised crown.
So within Thy palace gate
We shall praise, on golden strings,
Thee the only Potentate,
Lord of lords, and King of kings.

For unto us a child is born,
To us a son is giv’n;
The government shall rest on him,
Th’ anointed One from Heav’n.
His name is Wonderful Counselor,
The Mighty God is He,
The Everlasting Father,
The humble Prince of Peace.
The increase of his government
And peace shall never end;
He’ll reign on David’s ancient throne
As ruler of all men.
Upheld with justice and righteousness,
Forever his kingdom will last;
The zeal of the Lord God Most High
Will bring these things to pass.
Lord Jesus, come now and reign in me,
Be Lord of my life this hour.
Come be my Counselor and my God,
My source of wisdom and power.
Watch o’er me with your Father care,
My heart and my mind, fill with peace.
I worship you, my Lord and King,
My praise will never cease.

We see Jesus
For His suffering crowned
With glory and with praise
Tasting death for all men by God’s grace
Given pow’r to put all things in place
And we see Jesus
Seated at the right hand of the throne
Making intercession for His own
Upholding all things by His Word alone
For You are glorious
Shining victorious
Over powers and principalities
For You are glorious
Shining victorious
Disarming all Your enemies
The rulers of this world
Beneath Your feet are hurled
As You reign, our conquering King! 

I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Saviour, tho' earth-friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me:
And O that my Saviour were your Saviour too!
For you I am praying, for you I am praying,
For you I am praying, I'm praying for you.
I have a Father: to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven,
But O may He lead you to go with me too!
I have a robe: 'tis resplendent in whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
O when I receive it all shining in brightness,
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one too!
I have a peace: it is calm as a river,
A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
My Saviour alone is its Author and Giver,
And O could I know it was given to you!
When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too;
Then pray that your Saviour may bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered, 'twas answered for you! 

You have broken me on the rock
You have laid my soul open
With my heart exposed on the rock
I am grateful to be chosen
For your glory
Your glory, Lord
You have shown me the truth
Of my self-centered soul
You have stopped my foolish ways
As you put to death
This body of flesh
You save me from a godless grave
You have taken me to the cross
Where new life to me is given
By your mercy shown at the cross
With your Son my soul is risen

Gloriously you saved me, you saved me
So miraculously you made me brand new
You welcomed me with open arms, with open arms
Unfailingly your love is a river
So I will praise you, I will praise you
I'll praise your name forever and a day
And I'll live for you into eternity
I'll praise your name forever and a day
And I'll live what I sing, what I say
What I'm learning every day
Generously you gave me, you gave me
Marvelously you made me, you made me
Relentlessly I follow, I follow
Your majesty breathtaking, so beautiful

Forever here my rest shall be,
Close to Thy bleeding side;
This all my hope, and all my plea,
For me the Savior died!
My dying Savior, and my God,
Fountain for guilt and sin,
Sprinkle me ever in Thy blood,
And cleanse, and keep me clean.
Wash me, and make me thus Thine own,
Wash me, and mine Thou art,
Wash me, but not my feet alone,
My hands, my head, my heart.
The atonement of Thy blood apply,
Till faith to sight improve,
Till hope shall in fruition die,
And all my soul be love.
I do believe, I now believe,
That Jesus died for me;
And through His blood, His precious blood,
I shall from sin be free.

Heavenly Father, I come before you,
with all my cares.
I lift my hands to you in surrender,
Who can compare?
Change my heart God, for I long to be like you,
to be like you
You are light, You are holy
Forever I will be yours
You are love, You show mercy
Forever I will be yours.
Forever I will be yours
Forever I will be yours
Forever I will be yours
Forever I will be yours

No one can love me the way that you do
No one as faithful and true
You never leave me though I've been untrue
I am so thankful I have a friend like you
And I love You, I love You
My Jesus, my friend
I love you
For now and forever
Your love never fails me
You're true to the end
Oh Lord, You are forever my friend

Forever trusting in the Lord,
Take heed to do His will;
So shalt thou dwell within the land,
And He thy needs shall fill.
Delight thee in the Lord, and He
Will grant thy heart’s request;
To Him commit thy way in faith,
And thus thou shalt be blest.
And He shall make Thy righteousness
Shine brightly as the light,
And as the burning noonday sun
Thy judgment shall be bright.
Rest in the Lord with quiet trust,
Wait patiently for Him;
Though wickedness triumphant seem,
Let not thy faith grow dim.

“Forever with the Lord!"
Amen, so let it be!
Life from His death is in that word
’Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home
My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith’s foreseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear!
Ah! then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.
“Forever with the Lord!"
Forever in His will,
The promise of that faithful word,
Lord, here in me fulfill.
With You at my right hand,
Then I shall never fail;
Uphold me, Lord, and I shall stand,
Through grace I will prevail.
So when my latest breath
Breaks through the veil of pain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
That resurrection word,
That shout of victory:
Once more, “Forever with the Lord!"
Amen, so let it be!

We sigh for human love, from which
A whim or chance may sever,
And leave unsought the love of God,
Tho' God's love lasts forever.
We seek earth's peace in things that pass
Like foam upon the river,
While steadfast as the stars on high,
God's peace abides forever.
Man's help, for which we long, gives way,
As trees in stormwinds quiver,
But mightier than all human need
God's help remains forever.
Turn unto Thee our wav'ring hearts,
O Thou who failest never;
Give us Thy love and Thy great peace,
And be our Help forever!

Forgive me Oh, Lord for I have sinned
Help me Oh, Lord not to do it again 
Why do I sin, then do it again
Forgive me Oh, Lord for I have sinned
I know I will fall, help me rise over it all
Help me Oh, Lord not to do it again
Forgive me Oh, Lord for I have sinned 
Help me Oh, Lord not to do it again (
Forgive me Oh, Lord for I have sinned 
Help me Oh, Lord not to do it again (
Help me Oh, Lord (Fade Out)

“Forgive them, O my Father,
They know not what they do."
The Savior spoke in anguish,
As sharp iron nails went through.
No word of anger spoke He
To them that shed His blood,
But prayer and tenderest pity
Large as the love of God.
For me was that compassion,
For me that tender care;
I need His wide forgiveness
As much as any there.
It was my pride and hardness
That hung Him on the tree;
Those cruel nails, O Savior,
Were driven in by me.
And often I have slighted
Thy gentle voice that said:
Forgive me too, Lord Jesus,
I knew not what I did.
O depth of sweet compassion!
O love divine and true!
Save Thou the souls that slight Thee,
And know not what they do.

Father God
I need to know the truth of who I am in you
Father God, I need to see myself
In the same way that you see me
Just as you see me
There's no need to pull away, even when I fail
For you will never turn your face from me
I've got to know the truth that I can run to you
It's for freedom that you have set me free
Father God, you've forgiven all my sins
There's no need to repay you
Father God, help me walk in what you've done
Your love, your grace, and your mercy
Your great mercy

Forth from the dark and stormy sky,
Lord, to Thine altar’s shade we fly;
Forth from the world, its hope and fear,
Savior, we seek Thy shelter here:
Weary and weak, Thy grace we pray;
Turn not, O Lord, Thy guests away.
Long have we roamed in want and pain,
Long have we sought Thy rest in vain;
Wildered in doubt, in darkness lost,
Long have our souls been tempest tossed;
Low at Thy feet our sins we lay;
Turn not, O Lord, Thy guests away.

Forth from the dark and stormy sky,
Lord, to Thine altar’s shade we fly;
Forth from the world, its hope and fear,
Savior, we seek Thy shelter here:
Weary and weak, Thy grace we pray;
Turn not, O Lord, Thy guests away.

Forth in Thy Name, O Lord, I go,
My daily labor to pursue;
Thee, only Thee, resolved to know
In all I think or speak or do.
The task Thy wisdom hath assigned,
O let me cheerfully fulfill;
In all my works Thy presence find,
And prove Thy good and perfect will.
Preserve me from my calling’s snare,
And hide my simple heart above,
Above the thorns of choking care,
The gilded baits of worldly love.
Thee may I set at my right hand,
Whose eyes mine inmost substance see,
And labor on at Thy command,
And offer all my works to Thee.
Give me to bear Thy easy yoke,
And every moment watch and pray,
And still to things eternal look,
And hasten to Thy glorious day.
For Thee delightfully employ
Whate’er Thy bounteous grace hath giv’n;
And run my course with even joy,
And closely walk with Thee to Heav’n.

Forty days and forty nights
Thou wast fasting in the wild;
Forty days and forty nights
Tempted, and yet undefiled.
Sunbeams scorching all the day;
Chilly dew-drops nightly shed;
Prowling beasts about Thy way;
Stones Thy pillow; earth Thy bed.
Should not we Thy sorrow share
And from worldly joys abstain,
Fasting with unceasing prayer,
Strong with Thee to suffer pain?
Then if Satan on us press,
Jesus, Savior, hear our call!
Victor in the wilderness,
Grant we may not faint nor fall!
So shall we have peace divine:
Holier gladness ours shall be;
Round us, too, shall angels shine,
Such as ministered to Thee.
Keep, O keep us, Savior dear,
Ever constant by Thy side;
That with Thee we may appear
At the eternal Eastertide.

Forty days Thy seer of old
Communed with Thee, O Most High;
Fain Thy glories to behold
And Thy glory passing by.
In the rocky cleft he bowed;
Thou, as mortal gaze might bear,
Part revealed and part in cloud,
Didst Thy secret Name declare.
Forth days of Easter-tide
Thou didst commune with Thine own;
Now by glimpses, Lord, descried,
Handled now and proved and known;
Known, most Merciful, yet veiled;
Else before the awful sight
Surely heart and flesh had failed,
Smitten with exceeding light.
Risen Master, fain would we,
Sharing those unearthly days,
Morn and eve, on shore and sea,
Watch Thy movements, mark Thy ways;
Catch by faith each glad surprise
Of Thy footstep drawing nigh,
Hear Thy sudden greeting rise—
“Peace be to you! It is I";
Secrets of Thy kingdom learn,
Read the visions open spread,
Feel Thy Word within us burn,
Know Thee in the broken bread.
So Thy glory’s skirts beside
Gently led from grace to grace,
We Thy coming may abide,
And adore Thee face to face.

Christ, our mighty Captain, leads against the foe,
We will never falter when He bids us go;
Tho’ His righteous purpose we may never know,
Yet we’ll follow all the way.
Forward! forward! ’tis the Lord’s command;
Forward! forward! to the promised land;
Forward! forward! let the ring:
We are sure to win with Christ, our King!
Satan’s fearful onslaughts cannot make us yield;
While we trust in Christ, our Buckler and our Shield;
Pressing ever on—the Spirit’s sword we wield,
And we follow all the way.
Let our glorious banner ever be unfurled;
From its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled;
Christ, our mighty Captain, overcomes the world,
And we follow all the way.
Fierce the battle rages—but ’twill not be long,
Then triumphant, shall we join the blessed throng,
Joyfully uniting in the victor’s song—
If we follow all the way.

Forward through the ages, in unbroken line,
Move the faithful spirits, at the call divine;
Gifts in different measure, hearts of one accord,
Manifold the service, one the sure reward.
Forward through the ages, in unbroken line
Move the faithful spirits at the call divine.
Wider grows the kingdom, reign of love and light;
For it we must labor, till our faith is sight.
Prophets have proclaimed it, martyrs testified.
Poets sung its glory, heroes for it died.
Not alone we conquer, not alone we fall;
In each loss or triumph lose or triumph all.
Bound by God’s far purpose in one living whole,
Move we on together to the shining goal.

Forward! be our watchword, steps and voices joined;
Seek the things before us, not a look behind;
Burns the fiery pillar at our army’s head;
Who shall dream of shrinking, by our Captain led?
Forward through the desert, through the toil and fight;
Jordan flows before us; Zion beams with light.
Forward! When in childhood buds the infant mind;
All through youth and manhood not a thought behind;
Speed through realms of nature, climb the steps of grace;
Faint not, till in glory, gleams our Father’s face.
Forward, all the lifetime, climb from height to height,
Till the head be hoary, till the eve be light.
Forward! flock of Jesus, salt of all the earth,
Till each yearning purpose spring to glorious birth:
Sick, they ask for healing; blind, they grope for day;
Pour upon the nations wisdom’s loving ray.
Forward, out of error, leave behind the night;
Forward through the darkness, forward into light!
Glories upon glories hath our God prepared,
By the souls that love Him one day to be shared;
Eye hath not beheld them, ear hath never heard;
Nor of these hath uttered thought or speech a word;
Forward, marching eastward, where the heaven is bright,
Till the veil be lifted, till our faith be sight.
Far o’er yon horizon rise the city towers
Where our God abideth; that fair home is ours:
Flash the streets with jasper, shine the gates with gold;
Flows the gladdening river shedding joys untold.
Thither, onward, thither, in the Spirit’s might;
Pilgrims to your country, forward into light!
Into God’s high temple, onward as we press,
Beauty spreads around us, born of holiness;
Arch, and vault, and carving, lights of varied tone,
Softened words and holy, prayer and praise alone.
Every thought upraising to our city bright,
Where the tribes assemble round the throne of light.
Naught that city needeth of these aisles of stone;
Where the Godhead dwelleth, temple there is none;
All the saints that ever in these courts have stood,
Are but babes, and feeding on the children’s food.
On through sign and token, stars amidst the night,
Forward through the darkness, forward into light.
To th’eternal Father loudest anthems raise;
To the Son and Spirit echo songs of praise;
To the Lord of glory, blessed Three in One,
Be by men and angels endless honor done.
Weak are earthly praises, dull the songs of night:
Forward into triumph, forward into light!

Joyful we walk on the King’s highway,
Forward, ever forward;
High is our purpose and bright is the day,
Forward, ever forward.
All to our Lord we will gladly yield,
For by His Spirit our hearts are sealed;
In us His glory shall be revealed,
Forward, ever forward.
Christ, our Redeemer, shall lead the way
Onward, ever onward;
Nothing our progress to glory shall stay,
Onward, ever onward.
Facing the foe with an ardor high,
Plying our weapons till he must fly;
Vict’ry in Jesus shall be our cry,
Onward, ever onward.
Courage, then, brother, our way doth lie
Upward, ever upward;
On let us press to our home in the sky,
Upward, ever upward.
Crowns are awaiting us over there,
Glories unsullied that we may share;
Hasten to win all those treasures rare,
Upward, ever upward.
Sure shall our footsteps the pathway keep,
Trusting, ever trusting;
O’er the obstructions we boldly shall leap,
Trusting, ever trusting.
Then when the day of this world is done,
And in eternity life begun,
We shall remember that it was won
Trusting, ever trusting.

Founded on Thee, our only Lord,
On Thee, the everlasting Rock,
Thy Church shall stand, as stands Thy Word,
Nor fear the storm, nor dread the shock.
For Thee our waiting spirits yearn,
For Thee this house of praise we rear;
To Thee with longing hearts we turn:
Come, fix Thy glorious presence here.
Come, with Thy Spirit and Thy power,
The Conqueror, once the Crucified;
Our God, our Strength, our King, our Tower,
Here plant Thy throne, and here abide.
Accept the work our hands have wrought;
Accept, O God, this earthly shrine;
Be Thou our Rock, our life, our thought,
And we, as living temples, Thine.

Oh, faint not, weary soul,
Thy Savior’s near to thee;
He now will make thee whole,
Look up to Calvary.
Hail, fount of purity!
Hail, wondrous, cleansing blood!
Hail, great security!
Thou spotless Lamb of God.
Behold thy Savior dies,
He dies, He dies for thee;
’Tis finished now, He cries,
Oh, captive soul, be free! 
Thy sins of crimson dye
Shall white as wool appear;
Now to the fountain fly,
’Twill cleanse thee, do not fear.
Thy sins of scarlet hue
Shall all be white as snow;
There’s nothing thou canst do,
But to the fountain go.
Behold the fountain near,
By faith, oh, plunge today;
Oh, sin-sick soul, draw near—
’Twill purge thy stain away.

Fountain of good, to own Thy love,
Our thankful hearts incline;
What can we render, Lord, to Thee,
When all the worlds are Thine?
But Thou hast needy brethren here,
Partakers of Thy grace,
Whose names Thou wilt Thyself confess
Before the Father’s face.
And in their accents of distress
Thy pleading voice is heard;
In them Thou may’st be clothed and fed
And visited and cheered.
Thy face with rev’rence and with love
We in Thy poor would see;
O may we minister to them,
And in them, Lord, to Thee.

Fountain of grace, rich, full and free,
What need I, that is not in Thee?
Full pardon, strength to meet the day,
And peace which none can take away.
Doth sickness fill my heart with fear,
’Tis sweet to know that Thou art near;
Am I with dread of justice tried,
’Tis sweet to know that Christ hath died.
In life, Thy promises of aid
Forbid my heart to be afraid;
In death, peace gently veils the eyes;
Christ rose, and I shall surely rise.

Fountain of mercy, God of love,
Whose gifts all creatures share,
The rolling seasons as they move
Proclaim Thy constant care.
When in the bosom of the earth
The sower hid the grain,
Thy goodness marked its secret birth,
And sent the early rain.
The spring’s sweet influence, Lord, was Thine,
The seasons knew Thy call;
Thou mad’st the summer sun to shine,
The summer dews to fall.
The gifts of mercy from above
Matured the swelling grain;
And now the harvest crowns Thy love,
And plenty fills this plain.
O ne’er may our forgetful hearts
O’erlook Thy bounteous care,
But what our Father’s hand imparts
Still own in praise and prayer.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.

Fountain of never ceasing grace,
Thy saints’ exhaustless theme,
Great object of immortal praise,
Essentially supreme;
We bless Thee for the glorious fruits
Thine incarnation gives;
The righteousness which grace imputes,
And faith alone receives.
Whom heaven’s angelic host adores,
Was slaughtered for our sin;
The guilt, O Lord was wholly ours,
The punishment was Thine:
Our God in the flesh, to set us free,
Was manifested here;
And meekly bare our sins, that we
His righteousness might wear.
Imputatively guilty then
Our substitute was made,
That we the blessings might obtain
For which His blood was shed:
Himself He offered on the cross,
Our sorrows to remove;
And all He suffered was for us,
And all He did was love.
In Him we have a righteousness,
By God Himself approved;
Our rock, our sure foundation this,
Which never can be moved.
Our ransom by His death He paid,
For all His people giv’n,
The law He perfectly obeyed,
That they might enter Heav’n.
As all, when Adam sinned alone,
In his transgression died,
So by the righteousness of One,
Are sinners justified,
We to Thy merit, gracious Lord,
With humblest joy submit,
Again to Paradise restored,
In Thee alone complete.
Our souls His watchful love retrieves,
Nor lets them go astray,
His righteousness to us He gives,
And takes our sins away:
We claim salvation in His right,
Adopted and forgiv’n,
His merit is our robe of light,
His death the gate of Heav’n.

Hark! sinner, hark! we have tidings so true,
Tidings of pardon and blessings for you!
God in His word says that Christ on the tree,
Died for guilty sinners, and "Salvation is free."
Hear the news, sinner, free! free! free!
Why not believe it? 'Tis good news for thee.
Jesus the Just One has died on the tree,
Died for guilty sinners, and "Salvation is free."
Guilty you are, yet you know very well
Jesus has suffered to save you from hell;
Tho' now condemned, justified you may be,
Jesus paid the ransom, and "Salvation is free."
Trust not in "doing," it cannot avail.
Good resolutions and works can but fail;
"Grace, grace alone," is the saved sinner's plea,
"Not of works," the Scriptures say, "Salvation is free."
Trust not in feelings, your heart is depraved.
Trust only Jesus, who now lives to save;
Tears of repentance, tho' real they may be,
Ne'er can purchase heaven, for "Salvation is free."

Free from the law, O happy condition,
Jesus has bled and there is remission,
Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,
Grace hath redeemed us once for all.
Once for all, O sinner, receive it,
Once for all, O brother, believe it;
Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.
Now we are free, there’s no condemnation,
Jesus provides a perfect salvation.
“Come unto Me," O hear His sweet call,
Come, and He saves us once for all.
“Children of God," O glorious calling,
Surely His grace will keep us from falling;
Passing from death to life at His call;
Blessed salvation once for all.

This song in my heart, this song in my soul
This song I was born to sing
It's your song of freedom
Now I'm free to dance again
I'll sing in the darkness, I'll laugh in the rain
Rejoice in your love again
It's your song of freedom
Now I'm free to dance again
Your Spirit brings me liberty
Your breath of life has set me free
Jesus, your love it lifts me high
Gives me reason to run this race with joy
This song within me Lord will bless your Holy name
Jesus, I'll dance before your throne
Bring this heavenly sound to you alone
This song within me Lord will bless your Holy name

Free to run the race!
Yeah!
Night is falling now, blood is on the brow, free to run the race
Nailed to the wood, power in the blood, died in my place
Common legacy, common victory, free to run the race
We're all pure in Jesus eyes, running for the prize, mark of holiness
Hall of famers who've gone before us a hundred million strong
And your faith in Jesus will never fail you though the road is long
And we're.
Free to run yeah we're free to run the race (free to run the race)
Yeah we're free to run, yeah we're free to run the race (free to run the race)
Eyes of faith to fend attack, plant the banner and no turning back
Free to run, yeah we're free to run the race
Running through the rain, storms and rough terrain though on solid ground
We have guidance from the Lord, Devil's snares avoid running for the crown
We are casting off the weight, Savior's storms abate when my faith is down
You know life is in the death, free is every breath when we choose the Son
Live a life of holiness bought with a fearful price
And we're called to liberty, called a family, we're called to sacrifice
And we're.
Free to run yeah we're free to run the race (free to run the race)
Yeah we're free to run, yeah we're free to run the race (free to run the race)
King and Savior on high adored let the people sing, "Jesus is Lord!"
Free to run, yeah we're free to run the race
We're free to run, run, run
King and Savior on high adored, let the people sing, "Jesus is Lord!"
Free to run, free to run the race
Freedom, free to run the race
We're free to run
Free to run (we are free to run) the race!

Jesus comes He comes in power (repeat)
Pour down Your spirit like a shower (repeat)
Give us freedom and joy in your presence Lord
In Your presence we're free
Oh let us shout and dance and lift up our hands
And sing cause we are free
And He loves to come and fill me up
He loves to overflow my cup
He loves to come and bring His love 
He loves to come and bring His touch to my heart
Turn my mourning into dancing
Turn my weeping into laughing
When he comes, he comes in power (repeat)
When Jesus comes, he comes in power
Come, Lord, come in power

God forgave my sin in Jesus' name,
I've been born again in Jesus' name,
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His love as He told me to.
He said, Freely, freely you have received;
Freely, freely give.
Go in my name and because you believe,
Others will know that I live."
All power is given in Jesus' name,
In earth and heaven, in Jesus' name;
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His power as He told me to.

God forgave my sin in Jesus' name,
I've been born again in Jesus' name,
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His love as He told me to.
He said, Freely, freely you have received;
Freely, freely give.
Go in my name and because you believe,
Others will know that I live."
All power is given in Jesus' name,
In earth and heaven, in Jesus' name;
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His power as He told me to.

Fret not thyself, nor envious be,
When wicked workers thou shalt see,
Who prosper in their way;
For like the grass they perish soon,
And, like the herb cut down at noon,
They wither in a day.
Trust in the Lord and still do well,
Within the land securely dwell,
Feed on His faithfulness;
Delight thee also in the Lord,
And to thy heart He will accord
The good it would possess.
Yea, to the Lord thy way is known;
Confide in Him Who on the throne
Abides in power divine;
Thy righteousness He shall display;
Resplendent as the light of day,
It shall unclouded shine.
Rest in the Lord and be thou still,
With patience wait His holy will,
Enduring to the end.
Fret not though sinners’ gains increase;
Forsake thy wrath, from anger cease;
It will to evil tend.
The evil-doer soon shall die,
But those that on the Lord rely
Shall all the land obtain.
A little while and thou shalt see
That wicked man cut off shall be,
They shall be sought in vain.
Yea, thou shalt soon consider well
The place where they were wont to dwell,
And it shall not be found;
But saints shall all the land possess,
And find delight and happiness
Where fruits of peace abound.
The vile may plot against the just
Who in the Lord Jehovah trust,
But God will scorn them all;
The Lord their coming day shall see,
When broken all their power shall be,
And ruin on them fall.

A friend I have called Jesus, Whose love is strong and true,
And never fails howe’er ’tis tried, no matter what I do;
I’ve sinned against this love of His, but when I knelt to pray,
Confessing all my guilt to Him, the sin clouds rolled away.
It’s just like Jesus to roll the clouds away,
it’s just like Jesus to keep me day by day,
it’s just like Jesus all along the way,
It’s just like His great love.
Sometimes the clouds of trouble bedim the sky above,
I cannot see my Savior’s face, I doubt His wondrous love;
But He, from heaven’s mercy seat, beholding my despair,
In pity bursts the clouds between, and shows me He is there.
When sorrow’s clouds o’ertake me, and break upon my head,
When life seems worse than useless, and I were better dead;
I take my grief to Jesus then, nor do I go in vain,
For heavenly hope He gives that cheers like sunshine after rain.
O, I could sing forever of Jesus’ love divine,
Of all His care and tenderness for this poor life of mine;
His love is in and over all, and wind and waves obey,
When Jesus whispers “Peace, be still!" and rolls the clouds away.

Friend of sinners Lord of truth
I am falling in love with You
Friend of sinners Lord of truth
I have fallen in love with You
Jesus I love Your name
the name by which we're saved
Jesus I love Your name
the name by which we're saved
Friend of sinners Lord of truth
I am giving my life to You
Friend of sinners Lord of truth
I have given my life to You
(

Friend of sinners, Lord of glory,
Lowly, mighty, Brother, King!
Musing o’er Thy wondrous story,
Grateful we Thy praises sing:
Friend to help us, cheer us, save us,
In Whom pow’r and pity blend—
Praise we must the grace which gave us
Jesus Christ, the sinners’ Friend.
Friend Who never fails nor grieves us,
Faithful, tender, constant, kind;
Friend Who at all times receives us,
Friend Who came the lost to find.
Sorrow soothing, joys enhancing,
Loving until life shall end;
Then conferring bliss entrancing,
Still, in heaven, the sinners’ Friend.
O to love and serve Thee better!
From all evil set us free;
Break, Lord, every sinful fetter;
Be each thought conformed to Thee:
Looking for Thy bright appearing,
May our spirits upward tend;
Till no longer doubting, fearing,
We behold the sinners’ Friend.

Friend of the home: as when in Galilee
The mothers brought their little ones to Thee,
So we, dear Lord, would now the children bring,
And seek for them the shelter of Thy wing.
Thine are they, by Thy love’s eternal claim,
Thine we baptize them in the threefold Name;
Yet not the sign we trust, Lord, but the grace
That in Thy fold prepared the lambs a place.
Lord, may Thy Church, as with a mother’s care,
For Thee the lambs within her bosom bear;
And grant, as morning grows to noon, that they
Still in her love and holy service stay.
Draw through the child the parents nearer Thee,
Endue their home with growing sanctity;
And gather all, by earthly homes made one,
In Heaven, O Christ, when earthly days are done.

Words: Deborah D.Smith 
Packing up the dreams God planted
In the fertile soil of you
I can't believe the hope he's granted
Means a chapter in your life is through
But we'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong.
And friends are friends forever
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say never
'Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hand we know
That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends
With the faith and love God's given
Springing from the hope we know
We will pray the joy you'll live in
Is the strength that now you show
To live as friends (x2)

Friends all around me are trying to find
What the heart yearns for, by sin undermined;
I have the secret, I know where ’tis found:
Only true pleasures in Jesus abound.
All that I want is in Jesus.
He satisfies, joy He supplies;
Life would be worthless without Him;
All things in Jesus I find.
Some carry burdens whose weight has for years
Crushed them with sorrow and blinded with tears.
Yet One stands ready to help them just now,
If they will humbly in penitence bow.
No other name thrills the joy chords within,
And through none else is remission of sin.
He knows the pain of the heart sorely tried.
Both need and want will by Him be supplied.
Jesus is all this poor world needs today.
Blindly they strive, for sin darkens their way.
O to draw back the grim curtains of night,
One glimpse of Jesus and all will be bright!

A friend of Jesus! O what bliss
That one so vile as I
Should ever have a Friend like this
To lead me to the sky!
Friendship with Jesus!
Fellowship divine!
O what blessed, sweet communion!
Jesus is a Friend of mine.
A Friend when other friendships cease,
A Friend when others fail,
A Friend Who gives me joy and peace,
A Friend when foes assail!
A Friend when sickness lays me low,
A Friend when death draws near,
A Friend as through the vale I go,
A Friend to help and cheer!
A Friend when life’s short race is o’er
A Friend when earth is past,
A Friend to meet on Heaven’s shore,
A Friend when home at last!

From age to age they gather, all the brave of heart and strong;
In the strife of truth with error, of the right against the wrong;
I can see their gleaming banner, I can hear their triumph song;
The truth is marching on.
Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah! The truth is marching on.
“In this sign we conquer," ’tis the symbol of our faith,
Made holy by the might of love triumphant over death;
“He who finds his life loseth it," forevermore it saith,
The right is marching on!
Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah! The right is marching on!
The earth is circling onward out of shadow into light;
The stars keep watch above our way, however dark the night;
For every martyr’s stripe there glows a bar of morning bright;
And love is marching on!
Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah! And love is marching on!
Lead on, O cross of martyr faith, with thee is victory;
Shine forth, O stars and reddening dawn, the full day yet shall be;
On earth His kingdom cometh, and with joy our eyes shall see,
Our God is marching on.
Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah! Our God is marching on.

From all that dwell below the skies,
Let the Creator’s praise arise;
Let the Redeemer’s Name be sung,
Through every land, by every tongue.
Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord;
Eternal truth attends Thy Word.
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore,
Till suns rise and set no more.
Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring,
In songs of praise divinely sing;
The great salvation loud proclaim,
And shout for joy the Savior’s Name.
In every land begin the song;
To every land the strains belong;
In cheerful sounds all voices raise,
And fill the world with loudest praise.

From All That's Mortal, All That's Vain
And from this earthly clod,
Arise my soul, and strive to gain
Sweet fellowship with God.
Say, what is there beneath the skies,
In all the paths thou'st trod,
Can suit thy wishes or thy joys,
Like fellowship with God.
Not life, nor all the toys of art,
Nor pleasure's flow'ry road,
Can to my soul such bliss impart,
As fellowship with God.
When I am made in love to bear,
Affliction's needful rod,
Light, sweet, and kind the strokes appear,
Through fellowship with God.
In fierce temptation's fiery blasts,
Or dark desertion's road,
I'm happy if I can but taste
Some fellowship with God.
And when the icy hand of death
Shall chill my flowing blood,
With joy I'll yield my latest breath
In fellowship with God.
When I, at last, to heav'n ascend,
And gain my blest abode,
There an eternity I'll spend
In fellowship with God.

From all the dark places of earth’s heathen races,
O see how the thick shadows fly!
The voice of salvation awakes every nation,
Come over and help us, they cry.
The kingdom is coming, O tell ye the story,
God’s banner exalted shall be!
The earth shall be full of His knowledge and glory,
As waters that cover the sea.
The sunlight is glancing o’er armies advancing
To conquer the kingdoms of sin;
Our Lord shall possess them,
His presence shall bless them,
His beauty shall enter them in.
With shouting and singing, and jubilant ringing,
Their arms of rebellion cast down;
At last every nation the Lord of salvation
Their King and Redeemer shall crown!

From all the wind's wide quarters,
come, see the feast is spread,
of soul-sustaining waters,
of true and living bread;
of sorrows long-departed,
and joys beyond compare--
come, poor and humble-hearted,
the feast of life to share!
With mercy all-prevailing,
God bids the wanderer come;
in grace and peace unfailing
invites the children home.
With loving-kindness tender,
God frees us from our sins--
in glory and in splendor
the feast of life begins!
Come, claim the promise spoken!
God's purpose stands secure.
The fruitful word unbroken
shall evermore endure.
All ancient bondage ended
to sin's corrupting powers--
forgiven, freed, befriended,
the feast of life is ours!

From all Thy saints in warfare, for all Thy saints at rest,
To Thee, O blessed Jesus, all praises be addressed;
Thou, Lord, didst win the battle, that they might conquerors be;
Their crowns of living glory are lit with rays from Thee.
Praise, Lord, for Thine apostle, the first to welcome Thee,
The first to lead his brother the very Christ to see.
With hearts for Thee made ready, watch we throughout the year,
Forward to lead our brethren to own Thine Advent near.
All praise for Thine apostle, whose short lived doubtings prove
Thy perfect twofold nature, the fullness of Thy love.
On all who wait Thy coming shed forth Thy peace, O Lord,
And grant us faith to know Thee, true Man, true God, adored.
Praise for the first of martyrs, who saw Thee ready stand
To aid in midst of torments, to plead at God’s right hand.
Share we with him, if summoned by death our Lord to own,
On earth the faithful witness, in heaven the martyr’s crown.
Praise for the loved disciple, exiled on Patmos’ shore;
Praise for the faithful record he to Thy Godhead bore,
Praise for the mystic vision through him to us revealed.
May we, in patience waiting, with Thine elect be sealed.
Praise for Thine infant martyrs, by Thee with tenderest love
Called early from the warfare to share the rest above.
O Rachel! cease thy weeping: they rest from pains and cares.
Lord, grant us hearts as guileless and crowns as bright as theirs.
Praise for the light from heaven, praise for the voice of awe,
Praise for the glorious vision the persecutor saw.
Thee, Lord, for his conversion, we glorify today;
So lighten all our darkness with Thy true Spirit’s ray.
Lord, Thine abiding presence directs the wondrous choice
For one in place of Judas the faithful now rejoice.
Thy Church from false apostles forevermore defend,
And by Thy parting promise be with her to the end.
For him, O Lord, we praise Thee, the weak by grace made strong,
Whose labors and whose Gospel enrich our triumph song.
May we in all our weakness find strength from Thee supplied,
And all, as fruitful branches, in Thee, the Vine, abide.
All praise for Thine apostle, blest guide to Greek and Jew,
And him surnamed Thy brother; keep us Thy brethren true,
And grant us grace to know Thee, the Way, the Truth, the Life;
To wrestle with temptations still victors in the strife.
The son of consolation, moved by Thy law of love,
Forsaking earthly treasures, sought riches from above.
As earth now teems with increase, let gifts of grace descend,
That Thy true consolations may through the world extend.
We praise Thee for the Baptist, forerunner of the Word,
Our true Elias, making a highway for the Lord.
Of prophets last and greatest, we saw Thy dawning ray:
Make us the rather blessed who love Thy glorious day.
Praise for thy great apostle, the eager and the bold;
Thrice falling, yet repentant, thrice charged to keep Thy fold.
Lord, make Thy pastors faithful to guard their flocks from ill,
And grant them dauntless courage, with humble, earnest will.
For him, O Lord, we praise Thee, who, slain by Herod’s sword
Drank of Thy cup of suffering, fulfilling thus Thy word.
Curb we all vain impatience to read Thy veiled decree,
And count it joy to suffer, if so brought nearer Thee.
All praise for Thine apostle, the faithful, pure, and true,
Whom underneath the fig tree Thine eye all seeing knew.
Like him may we be guileless, true Israelites indeed,
That Thy abiding presence our longing souls may feed.
Praise, Lord, for Him Whose Gospel Thy human life declared,
Who, worldly gains forsaking, Thy path of suffering shared.
From all unrighteous Gammon O give us hearts set free,
That we, whate’er our calling, may rise and follow Thee.
For that “beloved Physician," all praise, whose Gospel shows
The Healer of the nations, The Sharer of our woes.
Thy wine and oil, O Savior, and bruised hearts deign to pour,
And with true balm of Gilead anoint us evermore.
Praise, Lord, for Thine apostles, who sealed their faith today:
One love, one zeal impelled them to tread the sacred way.
May we with zeal as earnest the faith of Christ maintain,
And, bound in love as brethren, at length Thy rest attain.
Apostles, prophets, martyrs, and all the sacred throng,
Who wear the spotless raiment, who raise the ceaseless song,
For these, passed on before us, Savior, we Thee adore,
And, walking in their footsteps, would serve Thee more and more.
Then praise we God the Father, and praise we God the Son,
And God the Holy Spirit, eternal Three in One;
Till all the ransomed number fall down before the throne,
And honor, power, and glory, ascribe to God alone.

Now to the holy city
The faithful gather home;
To Zion’s mount of glory 
With songs of joy they come.
Jerusalem the golden,
Jerusalem the free,
With joyful hearts and voices
The ransomed come to thee.
Now eye to eye beholding
The way-marks on the road,
All bound in love together,
They’re coming home to God:
One mind and mouth possessing,
They speak with one accord,
And in the heights of Zion
They shout and praise the Lord.
Sing glory to the Savior,
High over all the world;
On Zion’s heights forever
His banner is unfurled.
God’s church can be no longer
Obscured from human sight;
For see, on yonder mountain,
A city filled with light! 
No longer Babel’s bondage
The bride of Christ can hold;
God’s children now are holy,
And free from Babel’s fold:
For it is fallen, fallen,
And it shall rise no more;
We cling alone to Jesus,
As did the saints of yore.

From Bethany, the Master
Comes down Mt.Olive’s slope,
And all the world is singing,
A glad new song of hope;
Cry out, O stately cedars,
Along the rugged way!
Ye vineyards, shout hosanna,
To greet this happy day!
The King of Love, in triumph
Rides through the city’s gate;
Rejected, scorned—yet Victor,
The Conqueror of hate;
O wave your green palm branches!
Exalt His matchless worth!
This King of Love shall conquer
The nations of the earth.
Not of this world His kingdom;
His power is from above;
His realm is of the spirit,
His scepter—Truth and Love;
He calls us to His service,
His banner is unfurled;
With Thee we march, O Master,
To overcome the world.

From Calvary a cry was heard,
A bitter and heart-rending cry;
My Savior! every mournful word
Bespeaks Thy soul’s deep agony.
A horror of great darkness fell
On Thee, Thou spotless, holy One!
And all the swarming hosts of hell
Conspired to tempt God’s only Son.
The scourge, the thorns, the deep disgrace,
These Thou couldst bear, nor once repine;
But when Jehovah veiled His face,
Unutterable pangs were Thine.
Let the dumb world its silence break;
Let pealing anthems rend the sky;
Awake, my sluggish soul, awake!
He died, that we might never die.
Lord, on Thy cross I fix mine eye:
If e’er I lose its strong control,
O let that dying, piercing cry
Melt and reclaim my wandering soul.

From days of early youth, O God,
By Thee have I been taught,
And faithfully have I declared
The wonders Thou hast wrought.
O gracious God, forsake me not
When I am old and gray,
That unto those that follow me
I may Thy might display.
Thy perfect righteousness, O God,
The height of Heav’n exceeds,
O who is like to Thee, Who hast
Performed such mighty deeds?
Thou Who hast sent me many griefs,
Wilt yet my soul restore,
And out of sorrow’s lowest depths
Wilt bring me forth once more.
O turn again and comfort me,
My waning strength increase,
And for Thy faithfulness, O God,
My praise shall never cease.
Thou Holy One of Israel,
To Thee sweet songs I raise;
The soul Thou hast redeemed from death
Shall give Thee joyful praise.
My enemies that seek my hurt
Thy help has put to shame;
My thankful tongue will ceaselessly
Thy righteousness proclaim.

From death to life, oh, what a thought!
Within my soul what change is wrought
By pow’r divine, no tongue can tell,
One thing I know—for me ’tis well;
From darkness unto light sublime,
Through my Redeemer’s matchless Name;
For this He left His home on high,
That I should not forever die.
Oh, praise the Lord for victory,
From death to life He lifted me;
By His great love and pow’r divine
Eternal life is truly mine.
There Jesus paid it all, I see,
To bring this wondrous life to me;
Life from above, oh, joy sublime!
That such a treasure should be mine;
Now in God’s Son I have a part,
Eternal life within my heart,
Translated from the shades of night,
Into the realm of glorious light.
A resurrection, I confess,
Has taken place within my breast;
I’ve been awakened from the dead,
And now I live with Christ instead;
And when I lay this body down,
To mold and crumble in the ground,
My ransomed soul shall fly away,
To one long, bright, eternal day.
There light and life without an end
Into eternity shall blend;
And I the Lord of life shall greet,
And worship at His blessed feet;
Then may I clasp His nail-scarred hands,
Which broke for me death’s awful bands,
By His great love; how could it be?
From death to life He lifted me.

From deep distress and troubled thoughts
To Thee, my God, I raised my cries;
If Thou severely mark our faults,
No flesh can stand before Thine eyes.
But Thou hast built Thy throne of grace
Free to dispense Thy pardons there,
That sinners may approach Thy face,
And hope and love, as well as fear.
As the benighted pilgrims wait
And long, and wish for breaking day,
So waits my soul before Thy gate;
When will my God His face display?
My trust is fixed upon Thy Word,
Nor shall I trust Thy Word in vain;
Let mourning souls address the Lord
And find relief from all their pain.
Great is His love, and large His grace,
Through the redemption of His Son;
He turns our feet from sinful ways,
And pardons what our hands have done.

From deepest woe I cry to thee;
Lord, hear me, I implore thee!
Bend down thy gracious ear to me;
I lay my sins before thee.
If thou rememberest every sin,
if nought but just reward we win,
could we abide thy presence?
Thou grantest pardon through thy love;
thy grace alone availeth.
Our works could ne'er guild remove;
yea, e'en the best life faileth.
For none may boast themselves of aught,
but must confess thy grace that wrought
whate'er in them is worthy.
And thus my hope is in the Lord,
and not in my own merit;
I rest upon his faithful word
to them of contrite spirit.
That he is merciful and just,
here is my comfort and my trust;
his help I wait with patience.

From depths of woe I cry to Thee,
Lord, hear me, I implore Thee.
Bend down Thy gracious ear to me,
My prayer let come before Thee.
If Thou rememberest each misdeed,
If each should have its rightful meed,
Who may abide Thy presence? 
Thy love and grace alone avail
To blot out my transgression;
The best and holiest deeds must fail
To break sin's dread oppression.
Before Thee none can boasting stand,
But all must fear Thy strict demand
And live alone by mercy.
Therefore my hope is in the Lord
And not in mine own merit;
It rests upon His faithful Word
To them of contrite spirit
That He is merciful and just;
This is my comfort and my trust.
His help I wait with patience.
And though it tarry till the night
And till the morning waken,
My heart shall never doubt His might
Nor count itself forsaken.
Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,
Ye of the Spirit born indeed;
Wait for your God's appearing.
Though great our sins and sore our woes,
His grace much more aboundeth;
His helping love no limit knows,
Our utmost need it soundeth.
Our shepherd good and true is He,
Who will at last His Israel free
From all their sin and sorrow.

From east to west, from shore to shore,
Let every heart awake and sing
The holy Child Whom Mary bore,
The Christ, the everlasting King.
Behold, the world’s Creator wears
The form and fashion of a slave;
Our very flesh our Maker shares,
His fallen creature, man, to save.
For this how wondrously He wrought!
A maiden, in her lowly place,
Became, in ways beyond all thought,
The chosen vessel of His grace.
She bowed her to the angel’s word
Declaring what the Father willed,
And suddenly the promised Lord
That pure and hallowed temple filled.
He shrank not from the oxen’s stall,
He lay within the manger bed,
And He whose bounty feedeth all
At Mary’s breast Himself was fed.
And while the angels in the sky
Sang praise above the silent field,
To shepherds poor the Lord Most High,
The one great Shepherd, was revealed.
All glory for this blessed morn
To God the Father ever be;
All praise to Thee, O virgin born,
All praise, O Holy Ghost, to Thee.

From eternity, O God,
In Thy Son Thou didst elect me;
Therefore, Father, on life's road
Graciously to heaven direct me;
Send to me Thy Holy Spirit
That His gifts I may inherit.
Though alive, I'm dead in sin,
Lost to all good things by nature.
Holy Ghost, change me within,
Make of me a new-born creature;
For the flesh works ruination
And can never gain salvation.
Drive away the gloomy night
Of my heart's perverse reflection;
Quench all thoughts that are not right,
Hold my reason in subjection;
Grant that I from Thee, with yearning,
Wisdom always may be learning.
Oh, create a heart in me
That in Thee, my God, believeth
And o'er the iniquity
Of my sins most truly grieveth.
When dark hours of woe betide me,
In the wounds of Jesus hide me.
As a branch upon a vine
In my blessed Lord implant me;
Ever of my Head divine
To remain a member grant me.
Oh, let Him, my Lord and Savior,
Be my Life and Love forever! 
Faith and hope and charity
Graciously, O Father, give me;
Be my Guardian constantly
That the devil may not grieve me;
Grant me humbleness and gladness,
Peace and patience in my sadness.

From every spire on Christmas Eve, the Christmas bells ring clearly out
Their message of goodwill and peace, with many a call and silver shout.
For faithful hearts, the angels’ song still echoes in the frosty air,
And by the altar low they bow, in adoration and in prayer.
A thousand blessed memories throng, the stars are holy signs to them,
And from the eyes of every child looks forth the Babe of Bethlehem;
But there are others, not like these, whose brows are sad, whose hopes are 
crossed,
To whom the season brings no cheer, and life’s most gracious charm is lost.
To whom that story, old and sweet, is but a fable at the best,
The Christmas music mocks their ears, and life has naught of joy or rest.
Oh! for angel’s voice to pierce the clouds of grief that over them rise,
The mists of doubt and unbelief that veil the blue of Christmas skies.
That they, at last, may see the Light which shines from Bethlehem, and unfold
For Christ the treasures of their hearts, richer than spicery or gold.
Hope of the ages, draw Thou near, till all the earth shall own Thy sway,
And when Thou reignest in every heart it will, indeed, be Christmas Day.

From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat;
’Tis found beneath the mercy seat.
There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads;
A place than all besides more sweet;
It is the blood bought mercy seat.
There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat.
There, there, on eagles’ wings we soar,
And time and sense seem all no more;
And heaven comes down, our souls to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy seat.
Oh, let my hand forget her skill,
My tongue be silent, cold, and still,
This bounding heart forget to beat,
If I forget the mercy seat!

From foes that would the land devour,
From guilty pride and lust of power,
From wild sedition’s lawless hour,
From yoke of slavery,
From blinded zeal by faction led,
From giddy change by fancy bred,
From poisonous error’s serpent head
Good Lord, preserve us free!
Defend, O God! with guardian hand,
The laws and ruler of our land,
And grant our Church Thy grace to stand
In faith and unity!

From glory to glory I see You
The more I know You
The greater is my love for You
My God, just like a good potter
Break me, transform me
Mould me to Your own image, my Lord 
I want to be more like You
To see the world just like You do
Come and fill me with Your Holy Spirit
And I will show the world Your love

From glory to glory advancing, we praise thee, O Lord;
Thy Name with the Father and Spirit be ever adored.
From strength unto strength we go forward on Sion’s highway,
To appear before God in the city of infinite day.
Thanksgiving, and glory and worship, and blessing and love,
One heart and one song have the saints upon earth and above.
Evermore, O Lord, to Thy servants Thy presence be nigh;
Ever fit us by service on earth for Thy service on high.

“From Glory unto Glory!" Be this our joyous song,
As on the King’s own highway we bravely march along!
“From Glory unto Glory!" O word of stirring cheer,
As dawns the solemn brightness of one more glad new year.
Our own beloved Master “hath many things to say."
Look forward to His teaching, unfolding day by day;
To whispers of His Spirit, to insight clear and sweet,
To blessed consolation, while resting at His feet.
“From Glory unto Glory!" Our faith hath seen the King.
We own His matchless beauty, adoringly we sing;
But He hath more to show us! O thought of untold bliss!
And on we press rejoicing in blessed hope to this:—
To marvelous outpourings of ‘treasures new and old,’
To largess of His bounty, paid in the King’s own gold,
To glorious expansion of mysteries of grace,
To radiant unveilings of brightness from His face.
“From Glory unto Glory!" What great things He hath done,
What wonders He hath shown us, what triumphs He hath won!
We marvel at the record of blessings of the year!
But sweeter still than Christmas rings out His promise clear—
That “greater things," far greater, our longing eyes shall see!
We can but wait and wonder what “greater things" shall be!
But glorious fulfillments rejoicingly we claim,
While pleading in the power of His prevailing Name.
“From Glory unto Glory!" What mighty blessings crown
The lives for which our Lord hath laid His own so freely down!
Omnipotence to keep us, omniscience, too, to guide,
Jehovah’s blessed presence within us to abide!
The fullness of His blessing encompasseth our way;
The fullness of His promise crowns every brightening day;
The fullness of His glory is beaming from above,
While more and more we realize the fullness of His love.
“From Glory unto Glory!" Without a shade of care,
Because the Lord Who loves us will every burden bear;
Because we trust Him fully, and know that He will guide,
And know that He will keep us at His beloved side.
“From Glory unto Glory!" Though tribulation fall,
It cannot touch our treasure, when Christ is All in All!
Whatever lies before us, there can be naught to fear,
For what are pain and sorrow when Jesus Christ is near?
“From Glory unto Glory!" O marvels of the Word!
“With open face beholding the glory of the Lord,"
We, even we (O wonder!) “are changed into the same,"
The image of our Savior, to glorify His Name.
Abiding in His presence, and walking in the light,
And seeking to do always what is “pleasing in His sight";
We look to Him to keep us “all glorious within,"
Because the blood of Jesus is cleansing from all sin.
The things behind forgetting, we only gaze before
“From Glory unto Glory," that “shineth more and more,"
Because our Lord hath said it, that such shall be our way,
(O splendor of the promise!) “unto the perfect day."
“From Glory unto Glory!" Our fellow travelers still
Are gathering on the journey! The bright electric thrill
Of quick, instinctive union, more frequent and more sweet,
Shall swiftly pass from heart to heart in true and tender beat.
And closer yet, and closer, the golden bonds shall be,
Enlinking all who love our Lord in pure sincerity;
And wider yet, and wider, shall circling glory glow,
As more and more are taught our God’s mighty love to know.
O ye who seek the Savior, look up in faith and love;
Come up into the sunshine, so bright and warm above!
No longer tread the valley, but, clinging to His hand,
Ascend the shining summits and view the glorious land.
Our harp notes should be sweeter, our trumpet tones more clear,
Our anthems ring so grandly that all the world must hear!
O royal be our music, for who hath cause to sing
Like es of saved ones, the children of the King?
O, let our adoration for all that He hath done
Peal out beyond the heavens, while voice and life are one;
And let our consecration be real, and deep, and true.
O even now our hearts bow, and joyful vows renew!
“In full and glad surrender we give ourselves to Thee,
Thine utterly, and only, and evermore to be!
O Son of God, Who lov’st us, we will be Thine alone,
Our being and possessions, shall henceforth be Thine own!"
Now onward, ever onward, “from strength to strength" we go,
While “grace for grace" abundant shall from His fullness flow,
To glory’s full fruition, from glory’s foretaste here,
Until His very presence crown happiest new year.

From God shall naught divide me,
For He is true for aye
And on my path will guide me,
Who else should often stray.
His right hand holdeth me;
For me He truly careth,
My burdens ever beareth,
Wherever I may be.
When man’s help and affection
Shall unavailing prove,
God grants me His protection
And shows His power and love.
He helps in every need,
From sin and shame redeems me,
From chains and bonds reclaims me,
Yea, e’en from death I’m freed.
God shall be my Reliance
In sorrow’s darkest night;
Its dread I bid defiance
When He is at my right.
I unto Him commend
My body, soul, and spirit—
They are His own by merit—
All’s well then at the end.

From God the Father, virgin-born
To us the only Son came down;
By death the font to consecrate,
The faithful to regenerate.
Beginning from His home on high
In human flesh He came to die;
Creation by His death restored,
And shed new joys of life abroad.
Glide on, O glorious Sun, and bring
The gift of healing on Your wing;
To every dull and clouded sense
The clearness of Your light dispense.
Abide with us, O Lord, we pray;
The gloom of darkness chase away;
Your work of healing, Lord, begin,
And take away the stain of sin.
Lord, once You came to earth’s domain
And, we believe, shall come again;
Be with us on the battlefield,
From every harm Your people shield.
To You, O Lord, all glory be
For this Your blest epiphany;
To God Whom all His hosts adore,
And Holy Spirit evermore.

From Greenland’s icy mountains, from India’s coral strand;
Where Afric’s sunny fountains roll down their golden sand:
From many an ancient river, from many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver their land from error’s chain.
What though the spicy breezes blow soft o’er Ceylon’s isle;
Though every prospect pleases, and only man is vile?
In vain with lavish kindness the gifts of God are strown;
The heathen in his blindness bows down to wood and stone.
Shall we, whose souls are lighted with wisdom from on high,
Shall we to those benighted the lamp of life deny?
Salvation! O salvation! The joyful sound proclaim,
Till earth’s remotest nation has learned Messiah’s Name.
Waft, waft, ye winds, His story, and you, ye waters, roll
Till, like a sea of glory, it spreads from pole to pole:
Till o’er our ransomed nature the Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator, in bliss returns to reign.

From Heaven above to earth I come,
To bear good news to every home;
Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
Whereof I now will say and sing.
To you, this night, is born a Child
Of Mary, chosen mother mild;
This tender Child of lowly birth,
Shall be the joy of all your earth.
’Tis Christ our God, Who far on high
Had heard your sad and bitter cry;
Himself will your Salvation be,
Himself from sin will make you free.
He brings those blessings long ago
Prepared by God for all below;
That in His heavenly kingdom blest
You may with us forever rest.
These are the tokens ye shall mark,
The swaddling clothes and manger dark;
There shall ye find the young Child laid,
By Whom the heavens and earth were made.
Now let us all, with gladsome cheer,
Follow the shepherds, and draw near
To see this wondrous Gift of God,
Who hath His own dear Son bestowed.
Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!
What is it in yon manger lies?
Who is this Child, so young and fair?
The blessed Christ Child lieth there!
Welcome to earth, Thou noble Guest,
Through Whom e’en wicked men are blest!
Thou com’st to share our misery,
What can we render, Lord, to Thee!
Ah, Lord, Who hast created all,
How hast Thou made Thee weak and small,
To lie upon the coarse dry grass,
The food of humble ox and ass.
Were earth a thousand times as fair,
Beset with gold and jewels rare,
She yet were far too poor to be
A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.
For velvets soft and silken stuff
Thou hast but hay and straw so rough,
Whereon Thou King, so rich and great,
As ’twere Thy heaven, art throned in state.
Thus hath it pleased Thee to make plain
The truth to us, poor fools and vain,
That this world’s honor, wealth and might
Are naught and worthless in Thy sight.
Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,
Here in my poor heart’s inmost shrine,
That I may evermore be Thine.
My heart for very joy doth leap,
My lips no more can silence keep,
I too must sing, with joyful tongue,
That sweetest ancient cradle song.
Glory to God in highest Heaven,
Who unto man His Son hath given,
While angels sing, with pious mirth,
A glad New Year to all the earth.

From heaven You came,
Helpless babe,
Entered our world,
Your glory veiled;
Not to be served
But to serve,
And give Your life
That we might live.
This is our God,
The Servant King,
He calls us now
To follow Him,
To bring our lives
As a daily offering
Of worship to
The Servant King.
There in the garden
Of tears,
My heavy load
He chose to bear;
His heart with sorrow
Was torn,
‘Yet not My will
But Yours,’ He said.
This is our God,
The Servant King,
He calls us now
To follow Him,
To bring our lives
As a daily offering
Of worship to
The Servant King.
Come see His hands
And His feet,
The scars that speak
Of sacrifice;
Hands that flung stars
Into space
To cruel nails
Surrendered.
This is our God,
The Servant King,
He calls us now
To follow Him,
To bring our lives
As a daily offering
Of worship to
The Servant King.
So let us learn
How to serve,
And in our lives
Enthrone Him;
Each other’s needs
To prefer,
For it is Christ
We’re serving.
This is our God,
The Servant King,
He calls us now
To follow Him,
To bring our lives
As a daily offering
Of worship to
The Servant King.

From heaven's height Christ spake to call
the gentiles' great apostle, Paul,
whose doctrine, like the thunder, sounds
to the wide world's remotest bounds.
O bliss of Paul, beyond all though,
to paradise, yet living, caught!
He hears the heavenly mysteries there,
which mortal tongue cannot declare.
The word's good seed abroad he flings;
straightway a mighty harvest springs,
and fruits of holy deeds supply
God's everlasting granary.
The lamp his burning faith displays
has filled the world with glorious rays;
that darkness' realm may be o'erthrown,
and Christ may reign, and reign alone.

From highest Heav’n the eternal Son,
With God the Father ever One,
Came down to suffer and to die;
For love of sinful man He bore
Our human griefs and troubles sore,
Our load of guilt and misery.
Rejoice, ye saints of God, and praise
The Lamb Who died, His flock to raise
From sin and everlasting woe;
With angels round the throne above
O tell the wonders of His love,
The joys that from His mercy flow.
In darkest shades of night we lay,
Without a beam to guide our way,
Or hope of aught beyond the grave;
But He has brought us life and light,
And opened Heaven to our sight,
And lives forever strong to save.
Rejoice, ye saints of God, rejoice;
Sing out, and praise with cheerful voice
The Lamb Whom Heav’n and earth adore;
To Him Who gave His only Son,
To God the Spirit, with Them One,
Be praise and glory evermore.

From homes of quiet peace
We lift up hands of prayer,
And those Thou gavest us to love
Commend, Lord, to Thy care.
In perils of the sea
Watch o’er them day by day;
In perils of the common life
Be Thou their Strength and Stay.
Let Thine almighty arm
Be their defense and shield;
And whosoever’s cause is Thine
To them the victory yield.

From lands that see the sun arise,
To earth’s remotest boundaries,
The virgin born today we sing,
The Son of Mary, Christ the King.
Blest Author of this earthly frame,
To take a servant’s form He came,
That liberating flesh by flesh,
Whom He had made might live afresh.
In that chaste parent’s holy womb,
Celestial grace hath found its home:
And she, as earthly bride unknown,
Yet call that Offspring blest her own.
The mansion of the modest breast
Becomes a shrine where God shall rest:
The pure and undefiled one
Conceived in her womb the Son.
That Son, that royal Son she bore,
Whom Gabriel’s voice had told afore:
Whom, in his Mother yet concealed,
The Infant Baptist had revealed.
The manger and the straw He bore,
The cradle did He not abhor:
A little milk His infant fare
Who feedeth even each fowl of air.
The heavenly filled the sky,
The angels sang to God on high,
What time to shepherds watching lone
They made creation’s Shepherd known.
All honor, laud, and glory be,
O Jesu, virgin born, to Thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To the Father and to Paraclete.

From north and south and east and west,
When shall the peoples, long unblest,
All find their everlasting rest,
O Christ, in Thee?
When shall the climes of ageless snow
Be with the Gospel light aglow,
And all men their Redeemer know,
O Christ, in Thee?
When on each southern balmy coast,
Shall ransomed men, in countless host,
Rise, heart and voice, to make sweet boast,
O Christ, in Thee?
O when in all the Orient lands,
From cities white, and flaming sands,
Shall men lift dedicated hands,
O Christ, in Thee?
O when shall heathen darkness roll
Away in light, from pole to pole,
And endless day by every soul
Be found in Thee?
Bring, Lord, the long predicted hour,
The ages’ diadem and flower,
When all shall find their refuge, tower,
And home in Thee!

From ocean unto ocean, our land shall own Thee Lord,
And, filled with true devotion, obey Thy sovereign Word:
Our prairies and our mountains, the woods and fertile field,
Our rivers, lakes and fountains, to Thee shall tribute yield.
O Christ, for Thine own glory, and for our country’s weal,
We humbly plead before Thee, Thyself in us reveal;
And may we know, Lord Jesus, the touch of Thy dear hand;
And, healed of our diseases, the tempter’s power withstand.
Where error smites with blindness, enslaves and leads astray,
Do Thou in lovingkindness proclaim Thy Gospel day,
Till all the tribes and races that dwell in this fair land,
Adorned with Christian graces, within Thy courts shall stand.
Our Savior King, defend us, and guide where we should go;
Forth with Thy message send us, Thy love and light to show,
Till, fired with true devotion, enkindled by Thy word,
From ocean unto ocean our land shall own Thee Lord.

From Olive’s Hill, the multitude upgazing,
Beheld, until the Savior passed from view;
But radiant heralds uttered words of promise,
He Who has gone shall come again to you.
Again, again, the nations shall behold Him!
Again, again, enrobed in majesty;
In clouds of glory every eye shall see Him,
Again, again, the King of Glory see!
Again, but not in weakness or in sorrow;
Again, but not for bitter pain and loss;
The Son of God shall come in glory splendid,
Again, but not to bear shame’s bitter cross.
O Zion, clothe thyself in raiment holy;
Lift up thine eyes to greet thy coming King;
Rejoice, rejoice, no more be robed in sorrow,
Rejoice, O Zion, lift thy voice and sing.

From out the cloud of amber light,
Borne on the whirlwind from the north,
Four living creatures winged and bright
Before the prophet’s eyes came forth.
The voice of God was in the four
Beneath that awful crystal mist,
And every wondrous form they wore
Foreshadowed an evangelist.
The lion-faced, he told abroad
The strength of love, the strength of faith;
He showed th’almighty Son of God,
The Man divine Who won by death.
O Lion of the royal tribe,
Strong Son of God, and strong to save,
All power and honor we ascribe
To Thee Who only makest brave.
For strength to love, for will to speak,
For fiery crowns by martyrs won,
For suffering patience, strong and meek,
We praise Thee, Lord, and Thee alone.

From out the depths I cry, O Lord, to Thee,
Lord, hear my call.
I love Thee, Lord, for Thou dost heed my plea,
Forgiving all.
If Thou dost mark our sins, who then shall stand?
But grace and mercy dwell at Thy right hand.
I wait for God, the Lord, and on His Word
My hope relies;
My soul still waits and looks unto the Lord
Till light arise.
I look for Him to drive away my night,
Yea, more than watchmen look for morning light.
Hope in the Lord, ye waiting saints, and He
Will well provide;
For mercy and redemption full and free
With Him abide.
From sin and evil, mighty though they seem,
His arm almighty will His saints redeem.

From over hill and plain there comes the signal strain,
’Tis loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to Christ;
Its music rolls along, the hills take up the song,
Of loyalty, loyalty, yes, loyalty to Christ.
“On to victory! On to victory!"
Cries our great Commander, “On!"
We’ll move at His command,
We’ll soon possess the land,
Through loyalty, loyalty,
Yes, loyalty to Christ.
O hear, ye brave, the sound that moves the earth around,
’Tis loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to Christ;
Arise to dare and do, ring out the watchword true,
Of loyalty, loyalty, yes, loyalty to Christ.
Come, join our loyal throng, we’ll rout the giant wrong,
’Tis loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to Christ;
Where Satan’s banners float we’ll send the bugle note,
Of loyalty, loyalty, yes, loyalty to Christ.
The strength of youth we lay at Jesus’ feet today,
’Tis loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to Christ;
His Gospel we’ll proclaim, throughout the world’s domain,
Of loyalty, loyalty, yes, loyalty to Christ.

From starry skies descending,
Thou comest, glorious King,
A manger low Thy bed,
In winter's icy sting;
O my dearest Child most holy,
Shudd'ring, trembling in the cold!
Great God, Thou lovest me!
What suff'ring Thou didst bear,
That I near Thee might be!
Thou art the world's Creator,
God's own and true Word,
Yet here no robe, no fire
For Thee, Divine Lord.
Dearest, fairest, sweetest Infant,
Dire this state of poverty.
The more I care for Thee,
Since Thou, o Love Divine,
Will'st now so poor to be.

From that dear cross where Jesus died,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing;
From bleeding hands and feet and side,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing.
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing;
Flowing so free for you and for me,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing.
Come, wash the stain of sin away,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing;
Come, while ’tis called salvation’s day,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing.
For every contrite, wounded soul,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing;
Step in just now, and be made whole,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing.
For every weary, aching heart,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing;
A tender healing to impart,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing.
With life and peace upon its tide,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing;
Sweet blessings down the ages glide,
Calv’ry’s stream is flowing.

Words: Matt Lusk 
You loved me from the beginning, You loved me through the years
You loved me in my quiet times, You loved me in my tears
You loved me through my trials, You loved me through my fears
And because Your love was with me, I knew that You were here
Oh I may not be here on the day You come (on the day You come)
My time may have run out long before
But to be absent from this life is to be in the presence of the Lord
And I’ll be with my Jesus I adore
Every day I see something new revealed to me
And consequently I will never be the same
And in every new miracle is a love I find unavoidable
Oh Lord there is a power in Your name

From the cross uplifted high,
Where the Savior deigns to die,
What melodious sounds we hear,
Bursting on the ravished ear!
“Love’s redeeming work is done—
Come and welcome! sinner, come!
Sprinkled now with blood the throne;
Why beneath thy burdens groan?
On My pierced body laid,
Justice owns the ransom paid:
Bow the knee, and kiss the Son,
Come and welcome, sinner, come.
“Spread for thee, the festal board
See with richest bounty stored;
To thy Father’s bosom pressed,
Thou shalt be a child confessed,
Never from His house to roam;
Come and welcome! sinner, come!
“Soon the days of life shall end—
Lo, I come—your Savior, Friend!
Safe your spirit to convey
To the realms of endless day,
Up to My eternal home—
Come and welcome! sinner, come!"

Be strong and courageous whate’er may befall,
We know our Redeemer will answer our call;
Tho’ sorrow and trials are weighing us down,
Yet hope looks away from the cross to the crown.
From the cross to the crown let us follow our Lord,
From the cross to the crown let us cling to His Word;
Tho’ sorrow and trials are weighing us down,
Yet faith leads us on from the cross to the crown!
His cup of affliction was filled to the brim,
And are we not willing to suffer for Him?
The robe of His glory for us He laid down,
To show us the path from the cross to the crown.
This life is a conflict, a battle with sin,
Yet trusting in Jesus thro’ grace we shall win;
The world may oppose us, the tempter may frown,
Yet faith leadeth on from the cross to the crown.
Tho’ friends that are dearest have gone from our sight,
’Tis only to enter the mansions of light;
Their warfare is over, their burdens laid down,
How short was their path from the cross to the crown!

From the depths do I invoke Thee,
Lord, to me incline Thine ear;
To my voice be Thou attentive,
And my supplications hear.
Lord, if Thou shouldst mark transgressions,
In Thy presence who shall stand?
But with Thee there is forgiveness,
That Thy Name may fear command.
For Jehovah I am waiting
And my hope is in His Word;
In His Word of promise given,
Yea, my soul waits for the Lord.
For the Lord my soul is waiting
More than watchers in the night;
More than they for morning watching,
Watching for the morning light.
Hope in God, ye waiting people,
Mercies great in Him abound;
With the Lord a full redemption
From the guilt of sin is found.

From the depths my prayer ascendeth
Unto God on high;
Hear, O Lord, my supplication
And my cry.
None can stand unscathed and blameless
In Thy judgment just,
But the contrite in Thy mercy
Humbly trust.
Lord, my hope is in Thy promise,
And I wait for Thee
More than they who watch for morning,
Light to see.
With the Lord is tender mercy,
And redeeming love;
Israel, look for full salvation
From above.

From the depths of sin and failure,
From despair as black as night,
Lord, we hear our brothers calling
For deliverance and for light.
Use us, Lord, to speed Thy kingdom;
Through us may Thy will be done;
Give us eyes to see the vision
Of a world redeemed and won.
By the love that bore in silence
Man’s contempt and Satan’s dart;
By the longing for the lost ones
That consumes the Savior’s heart;
By the Savior’s blood that bought us,
By the peace His merits bring,
By the Spirit that constrains us
Now on earth to crown Him King;

From depths of woe I raise to Thee
The voice of lamentation;
Lord, turn a gracious ear to me
And hear my supplication;
If Thou iniquities dost mark,
Our secret sins and misdeeds dark,
O who shall stand before Thee?
To wash away the crimson stain,
Grace, grace alone availeth;
Our works, alas! are all in vain;
In much the best life faileth:
No man can glory in Thy sight,
All must alike confess Thy might,
And live alone by mercy.
Therefore my trust is in the Lord,
And not in mine own merit;
On Him my soul shall rest, His Word
Upholds my fainting spirit:
His promised mercy is my fort,
My comfort, and my sweet support;
I wait for it with patience.
What though I wait the livelong night,
And till the dawn appeareth,
My heart still trusteth in His might;
It doubteth not nor feareth:
Do thus, O ye of Israel’s seed,
Ye of the Spirit born indeed;
And wait till God appeareth.
Though great our sins and sore our woes,
His grace much more aboundeth;
His helping love no limit knows,
Our utmost need it soundeth.
Our Shepherd good and true is He,
Who will at last His Israel free.
From all their sin and sorrow.

From the eastern mountains, pressing on, they come,
Wise men in their wisdom, to His humble home;
Stirred by deep devotion, hasting from afar,
Ever journeying onward, guided by a star.
Light of life that shineth ere the worlds began,
Draw Thou near, and lighten every heart of man.
There their Lord and Savior meek and lowly lay,
Wondrous Light that led them onward on their way,
Ever now to lighten nations from afar,
As they journey homeward by that guiding star.
Thou Who in a manger once hast lowly lain,
Who dost now in glory o’er all kingdoms reign,
Gather in the heathen who in lands afar
Ne’er have seen the brightness of Thy guiding star.
Gather in the outcasts, all who’ve gone astray,
Throw Thy radiance o’er them, guide them on their way.
Those who never knew Thee, those who’ve wandered far,
Guide them by the brightness of Thy guiding star.
Onward through the darkness of the lonely night,
Shining still before them with Thy kindly light.
Guide them, Jew and Gentile, homeward from afar,
Young and old together, by Thy guiding Star.
Until every nation, whether bond or free,
’Neath Thy starlit banner, Jesus, follows Thee.
O’er the distant mountains to that heavenly home,
Where nor sin nor sorrow evermore shall come.

From The Manger To The Cross, rugged cross of calvary
The road that Jesus walked, for you and me, all a-lone
By this world forsaken, til He shed His blood for me
From The Manger To The Cross, the rugged cross of cal-va- ry.
The story [D/F#] in The Bible, it's a message sad but true
The life our Savior lived on earth is told
Found up-[D/F#] on the pages of The Master's book of truth
Ev'ry word so precious to my soul.[D7]
No earthly treasures did He own, He got no wealth or fame
Weary was the path, He had to trod
Here, He suffered many things, for this world knew Him not
He died upon the cross, The Son of God.

From the rising of the sun 
To the going down of the same, 
The name of the Lord shall be praised.
From the rising of the sun 
To the going down of the same, 
The name of the Lord shall be praised.
So praise ye the Lord.
Praise ye the Lord.
From the rising of the sun 
To the going down of the same, 
The name of the Lord shall be praised.

From the table now retiring
Which for us the Lord hath spread,
May our souls, refreshment finding,
Grow in all things like our Head.
His example while beholding
May our lives His image bear;
Him our Lord and Master calling,
His commands may we revere.
Love to God and man displaying,
Walking steadfast in His way,
Joy attend us in believing,
Peace from God, through endless day.

From the waiting comes the sign,
come, Holy Spirit, come;
from the presence comes the peace--
come, Holy Spirit, come;
from the silence comes the song--
come, Holy Spirit, come
and be to us, in truth,
the sign, the peace, the song.
In the burning is the fire--
come, Holy Spirit, come;
in the spending is the gift--
come, Holy Spirit, come;
in the breaking is the life--
come, Holy Spirit, come
and be to us, in faith,
the fire, the gift, the life.

From Thee all skill and science flow,
All pity, care and love,
All calm and courage, faith and hope;
O pour them from above.
And part them, Lord, to each and all,
As each and all shall need,
To rise, like incense, each to Thee,
In noble thought and deed.
And hasten, Lord, that perfect day
When pain and death shall cease;
And Thy just rule shall fill the earth
With health, and light, and peace.
When ever blue the sky shall gleam,
And ever green the sod;
And man’s rude work deface no more
The paradise of God.
The original version of this hymn started with these verses:
Accept this building, gracious Lord,
No temple though it be;
We raised it for our suffering kin,
And so, good Lord, for Thee.
Accept our little gift, and give,
To all who may here dwell,
The will and power to do their work,
Or bear their sorrows well.

Time onward flows like a river vast,
While age on age it has borne to the sea;
And down this stream we have come at last,
To see time end in eternity.
Eternity! Eternity!
Will you dwell with Christ in eternity? 
What is this life but a fleeting day?
Soon death will come with a stern decree;
Then one by one we must pass away,
And change from time to eternity.
A dial true is the Book divine,
Its hands approach with a certainty
The tolling point in the death of time,
The solemn change to eternity.
Oh, joyful day to the faithful soul
Who walks with Christ in His purity!
Life’s battle fought and the vict’ry won,
He shouts from time to eternity.

From whence doth this union arise
That hatred is conquered by love?
It fastens our souls in such ties
That nature and time can't remove.
It can not in Eden be found
Nor yet in a Paradise lost;
It grows on Immanuel's ground
And Jesus' rich blood it did cost.
My friends are so dear unto me.
Our hearts all united in love.
Where Jesus has gone we shall be.
In Yonder blest mansions above.
Oh! why then, so loath for to part.
Since we shall ere long meet again,
Engraved on Immanuel's heart.
At distance we cannot remain.
And when we shall see that bright day,
And join with the angels above;
And when these vile bodies of clay,
Are fashioned like Jesus above:
With Jesus we ever shall reign,
And all his bright glories shall see,
Singing, Hallelujah, Amen;
Amen, even so let it be.

From whence this fear and unbelief?
Hath not the Father put to grief
His spotless Son for me?
And will the righteous Judge of men
Condemn me for that debt of sin
Which, Lord, was charged on Thee?
Complete atonement Thou hast made,
And to the utmost Thou hast paid
Whate'er Thy people owed;
How then can wrath on me take place,
If sheltered in Thy righteousness,
And sprinkled with Thy blood?
If thou hast my discharge procured,
And freely in my room endured
The whole of wrath divine;
Payment God cannot twice demand,
First at my bleeding Surety's hand,
And then again at mine.
Turn then, my soul, unto thy rest!
The merits of thy great High Priest
Have bought thy liberty;
Trust in His efficacious blood,
Nor fear thy banishment from God,
Since Jesus died for thee.

If ye then with Christ be risen,
Seek those things which are above;
Putting off all wrath and malice,
Walk with Him in perfect love.
Lay aside all strife and envy,
Hatred, foolishness, and pride;
None who cling to aught that’s sinful
In His kingdom shall abide.
I am the Vine, I am the Vine,
Ye are the fruitful branches.
If we’re in the Spirit living,
Let us also walk therein,
Free from guilt and condemnation—
From the servitude of sin—
Bearing holy fruits of meekness,
Temperance and love and peace,
Faith and gentleness possessing,
Daily shall our joy increase.
Can there issue from one fountain
Both the bitter and the sweet?
Do we gather figs of thistles,
Sow the tares, expecting wheat?
So a good tree yields by nature
Perfect fruit, and that alone;
Trees corrupt are bearing evil—
By their fruits they shall be known.
Once of sin we were the servants,
Held beneath its tyrant sway,
Free from righteousness—unholy—
But we’ve found a better way.
By the word of God obeying,
We are free from sinful strife;
Fruits of holiness we’re yielding,
And the end eternal life.
We are dwelling in the Spirit,
By our Father’s blest design;
Through His grace we’re made partakers
Of His nature, pure, divine.
By His faith alone I’m living,
For with Christ to sin I died;
I will bear abundant fruitage,
That His name be glorified.

Full many shall come from the east and the west
And sit at the feast of salvation,
With Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob the blest,
Obeying the Lord’s invitation.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
But they who have always resisted His grace
And on their own virtue depended
Shall then be condemned and cast out from His face,
Eternally lost and unfriended.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
May we too give heed when our Savior doth call
In accents persuasive and tender,
And may we be guests at His feast, one and all,
Our praise and obeisance to render.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
Oh, that we the throng of the ransomed may swell,
To whom He hath granted remission!
God graciously make us in heaven to dwell
And save us from endless perdition.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
God grant that I may of His infinite love
Remain in His merciful keeping
And sit with the King at His table above
When here in the grave I am sleeping.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
Then ended will be, like a dream that is past,
All trial and trouble and sorrow;
All questions and doubts will be answered at last,
When dawneth eternity’s morrow.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
Then Heaven will ring with an anthem more grand
Than ever on earth was recorded,
When all of the saved shall receive at His hand
The crown to the victors awarded.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

Full salvation! full salvation!
Lo! the fountain, opened wide,
Streams thro' ev'ry land and nation
From the Saviour's wounded side.
Full salvation! full salvation!
Full salvation! full salvation!
Streams an endless crimson tide.
O the glorious revelation!
See the cleansing current flow,
Washing stains of condemnation
Whiter than the driven snow;
Full salvation! full salvation!
Full salvation! full salvation!
O the rapt'rous bliss to know!
Love's resistless current sweeping
All the regions deep within;
Thought and wish and senses keeping
Now, and ev'ry instant, clean.
Full salvation! full salvation!
Full salvation! full salvation!
From the guilt and pow'r of sin.
Life immortal, heav'n descending,
Lo! my heart the Spirit's shrine!
God and man in oneness blending—
O what fellowship is mine!
Full salvation! full salvation!
Full salvation! full salvation!
Raised in Christ to life divine!
Care and doubting, gloomy sorrow,
Fear and grief are mine no more;
Faith knows naught of dark tomorrow
For my Saviour goes before.
Full salvation! full salvation!
Full salvation! full salvation!
Full and free for evermore.

Savior, ’tis a full surrender,
All I leave to follow Thee;
Thou my Leader and Defender
From this hour shalt ever be.
I surrender all!
I surrender all!
All I have I bring to Jesus,
I surrender all.
As I come in deep contrition,
At this consecrated hour,
Hear, O Christ, my heart’s petition,
Let me feel the Spirit’s pow’r!
No withholding—full confession;
Pleasures, riches, all must flee;
Holy Spirit, take possession!
I no more, but Thou in me.
Be this theme my song and story,
Now and until life is o’er;
This my rapture, this my glory,
Till I reach the shining shore.
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Oh, the peace of love divine!
Oh, the bliss of consecration!
I am His, and He is mine.

I am kneeling (I am kneeling) before the Father (before the Father)
From Whom the earthly family (the earthly family) derives its’ name
I am praying (praying) for His power
Through His spirit in our inner being we live by Faith (we live by Faith)
His love (how wide, how long) surpasses knowledge (how high, how deep)
His love (how wide, how long) surpasses knowledge (how high, how deep)
I am kneeling (I am kneeling) before the Father (before the Father)
From Whom the heavenly family derives its’ name
I am praying (praying) out of His riches
You’ll be rooted and established in His love
And I pray for you with all the saints
That Christ live in your hearts through faith
And be filled to the measure of all fullness of God
And I pray for you with all the saints
That Christ live in your hearts through faith
And be filled to the measure of all fullness of God
How wide, how long, how high, how deep

Fully persuaded, Lord, I believe!
Fully persuaded, Thy Spirit give;
I will obey Thy call; low at Thy feet I fall;
Now I surrender all, Christ to receive.
Fully persuaded—Lord, hear my cry!
Fully persuaded—pass me not by;
Just as I am I come, I will no longer roam,
O make my heart Thy home; save, or I die!
Fully persuaded, no more opprest,
Fully persuaded, now I am blest;
Jesus is now my Guide, I will in Christ abide,
My soul is satisfied in Him to rest!
Fully persuaded, Jesus is mine;
Fully persuaded, Lord I am Thine!
O make my love to Thee like Thine own love to me,
So rich, so full and free, Savior divine!

I am fully saved today,
All my guilt is washed away,
And the love of God is flooding all my soul;
For His grace abides within,
Since I’ve been redeemed from sin,
And the precious blood of Jesus makes me whole.
I am fully saved today,
I am in the narrow way;
And no evil can betide,
For I’m walking by my Savior’s side.
I am fully saved today,
And I’m in the narrow way,
Walking with my blessed Savior hour by hour;
Though the way seems sometimes drear,
And the hosts of hell appear,
I shall ever conquer by His mighty pow’r.
I am fully saved today,
While His word I do obey,
On the promise now by faith I calmly rest;
Not a doubt or fear I know,
While I walk with Him below,
For I’m leaning on my Savior’s loving breast.

Fully surrendered to Jesus the Lord,
Fully surrendered, I trust in His Word;
Hath He not promised that all who believe,
Perfect salvation from Him shall receive?
Fully surrendered, fully surrendered,
All on the altar and under the blood;
Fully surrendered, fully surrendered,
Pardoned and cleansed, hallelujah to God!
Fully surrendered, the struggle is o’er,
Now from my Savior I’ll wander no more;
Gladly the world and its pleasures forsake,
And with my Savior the narrow way take;
Fully surrendered, to go or to stay,
Just where He needs me, His will to obey;
Humbly to follow wherever He leads,
Trusting His Word to supply all my needs.

The fast, as taught by holy lore,
We keep in solemn course once more;
The fast to all men known, and bound
In forty days of yearly round.
The law and seers that were of old
In divers ways this Lent foretold
Which Christ, all seasons’ King and Guide,
In after ages sanctified.
More sparing therefore let us make
The words we speak, the food we take,
Our sleep and mirth, and closer barred
Be every sense in holy guard.
In prayer together let us fall,
And cry for mercy, one and all,
And weep before the Judge’s feet,
And His avenging wrath entreat.
Thy grace have we offended sore,
By sins, O God, which we deplore;
But pour upon us from on high,
O pardoning One, Thy clemency.
Remember Thou, though frail we be,
That yet Thine handiwork are we;
Nor let the honor of Thy Name
Be by another put to shame.
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;
Increase the good that we have sought;
That we at length, our wanderings o’er,
May please Thee here and evermore.
We pray Thee, holy Trinity,
One God, unchanging Unity,
That we from this our abstinence
May reap the fruits of penitence.

The Father’s sole begotten Son
Was born, the virgin’s Child, on earth;
His cross for us adoption won,
The life and grace of second birth.
Forth from the height of Heav’n He came,
In form of man with man abode;
Redeemed His world from death and shame,
The joys of endless life bestowed.
Redeemer, come with power benign,
Dwell in the souls that look for Thee;
O let Thy light within us shine
That we may Thy salvation see.
Abide with us, O Lord, we pray,
Dispel the gloom of doubt and woe;
Wash every stain of guilt away,
Thy tender healing grace bestow.
Lord, Thou hast come, and well we know
That Thou wilt likewise come again;
Thy kingdom shield from every foe,
Thy honor and Thy rule maintain.
Eternal glory, Lord, to Thee,
Whom, now revealed, our hearts adore;
To God the Father glory be,
And Holy Spirit evermore.

The fight is on, the trumpet sound is ringing out,
The cry “To arms!" is heard afar and near;
The Lord of hosts is marching on to victory,
The triumph of the Christ will soon appear.
The fight is on, O Christian soldier,
And face to face in stern array,
With armor gleaming, and colors streaming,
The right and wrong engage today!
The fight is on, but be not weary;
Be strong, and in His might hold fast;
If God be for us, His banner o’er us,
We’ll sing the victor’s song at last!
The fight is on, arouse, ye soldiers brave and true!
Jehovah leads, and victory will assure;
Go buckle on the armor God has given you,
And in His strength unto the end endure.
The Lord is leading on to certain victory;
The bow of promise spans the eastern sky;
His glorious Name in every land shall honored be;
The morn will break, the dawn of peace is nigh.

I’ve been on Mount Pisgah’s lofty height,
And I’ve satisfied my longing heart’s desire;
For I caught a glimpse of glory bright,
And my soul is burning with the fire.
O the fire is burning, yes, ’tis brightly burning,
O ’tis burning, burning in my soul;
O the fire is burning, yes, ’tis brightly burning,
O ’tis burning, burning in my soul.
I will walk with Jesus, bless His Name,
And to be like Him I ev’ry day aspire;
For His love is like a heav’nly flame,
And my soul is burning with the fire.
I my all upon the altar lay,
As I to my closet lovingly retire;
And the flame consumes while there I pray,
And my soul is burning with the fire.
By faith’s eye I scan the ocean’s foam,
And beyond I see the haven I desire;
There I view the beacon lights of home,
And my soul is burning with the fire.

The fires of the sun shall be quenched at last,
And the steadfast stars be gone;
But souls of the ransomed shall live in strength,
And they still shall be going on.
Going on, going on,
They still shall be going on;
Forever and aye, through eternal day,
They still shall be going on.
As souls that remember and feel and thrill,
We shall live when seas are dry;
As separate beings, to love and will,
We shall live, nevermore to die.
From glory to glory our path shall be,
And from grace to perfect grace;
Through all the wide years of eternity,
We shall look on our dear Lord’s face.
Going on, going on,
We still shall be going on;
Forever and aye, through eternal day,
We still shall be going on.

The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay tending their sheep,
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest,
Over Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie;
One entered it them for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty.
Then entered in those Wise Men three,
Full reverently upon the knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Between an ox stall and an ass,
This Child truly there He was;
For want of clothing they did Him lay
All in a manger, among the hay.
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.
If we in our time shall do well,
We shall be free from death and hell;
For God hath prepared for us all
A resting place in general.

He dies! the Friend of sinners dies!
Lo! Salem’s daughters weep around;
A solemn darkness veils the skies,
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.
Come, saints, and drop a tear or two
For Him who groaned beneath your load:
He shed a thousand drops for you,
A thousand drops of richer blood.
Here’s love and grief beyond degree:
The Lord of Glory dies for men!
But lo! what sudden joys we see,
Jesus, the dead, revives again!
The rising God forsakes the tomb;
The tomb in vain forbids His rise;
Cherubic legions guard Him home,
And shout Him welcome to the skies.
Break off your fears, ye saints, and tell
How high your great Deliv’rer reigns;
Sing how He spoiled the hosts of hell,
And led the monster death in chains!
Say, “Live forever, wondrous King!
Born to redeem, and strong to save;"
Then ask the monster, “Where’s thy sting?"
And, “Where’s thy vict’ry, boasting grave?"

Jesus, our Brother, strong and good,
Was humbly born in a stable rude,
And the friendly beasts around Him stood,
Jesus, our Brother, strong and good.
的," said the donkey, shaggy and brown,
的 carried His mother uphill and down,
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town;
I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown.
的," said the cow, all white and red,
的 gave Him my manger for His bed,
I gave Him hay to pillow His head;
I," said the cow, all white and red.
的," said the sheep with curly horn,
的 gave Him my wool for His blanket warm,
He wore my coat on Christmas morn;
I," said the sheep with curly horn.
的," said the dove, from the rafters high,
的 cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry,
We cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I;
I," said the dove, from the rafters high.
Thus all the beasts, by some good spell,
In the stable dark were glad to tell
Of the gifts they gave Emmanuel,
The gifts they gave Emmanuel.

What! sitting at ease when there’s work to be done!
The best of the day half its circuit has run;
Yon orb to its zenith rides forth in the sky;
What! sitting at ease and the harvest so nigh!
Oh, look on the fields, that already are white;
The Lord hath commanded to work in the light;
Beware lest, instead of the bright, golden sheaves,
We bring to Him only a handful of leaves.
What! sitting at ease, leaving others the toil
Of training the vineyard and tilling the soil;
This truth in our mind let us constantly keep,
From seed what we scatter the fruit we shall reap.
What! sitting at ease, when a burden of care
Our brother has borne we might help him to bear;
Oh, let us be earnest, and work while we may,
The Master is calling, arise and away.
No longer at ease we are folding our hands,
But, willing to do what the Savior commands,
We’ll work till the harvest, then gather the sheaves,
And bring to Him more than a handful of leaves.

A holy air is breathing round,
A fragrance from above;
Be every soul from sense unbound,
Be every spirit love.
O God, unite us heart to heart,
In sympathy divine,
That we be never drawn apart,
To love not Thee nor Thine.
But by the cross of Jesus taught,
And all His gracious word,
Be nearer to each other brought,
And nearer Thee, O Lord.

There’s a home in my heart for Jesus,
In the heart He has cleansed from sin;
’Tis the shrine of a deep devotion,
And my Savior abides within.
There’s a home in my heart,
And Jesus abides within;
He will always be a friend to me,
There’s a home in my heart for Him.
There’s a home in my heart for Jesus,
There’s a sympathy rare and sweet;
There are days of divine communion,
When His presence is bliss complete.
There’s a home in my heart for Jesus,
And He whispers that all is well;
In the light of His love abiding,
There’s a joy that no words can tell.

A hymn of glory let us sing
New songs throughout the world shall ring
Alleluia, Alleluia.
Christ, by a road before untrod
Ascendeth to the throne of God.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
The holy apostolic band
Upon the Mount of Olives stand
Alleluia, Alleluia.
And with His followers they see
Jesus’ resplendent majesty
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
To Whom the angels drawing nigh,
“Why stand and gaze upon the sky?"
Alleluia, Alleluia.
“This is the Savior," thus they say.
“This is His noble triumph day."
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
“Again ye shall behold Him so,
As ye have today seen Him go."
Alleluia, Alleluia.
“In glorious pomp ascending high
Up to the portals of the sky."
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
O grant us thitherward to tend
And with unwearied hearts ascend,
Alleluia, Alleluia.
Unto Thy kingdom’s throne, where Thou
As is our faith, art seated now,
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
Be Thou our Joy and strong Defense,
Who art our future Recompense,
Alleluia, Alleluia.
So shall the light that springs from Thee
Be ours through all eternity,
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
All praise to Thee let earth accord,
Alleluia, Alleluia.
Who art, while endless ages run,
With Father and with Spirit One,
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

Here we would see Jesus, wearied with the journey,
We turn again to be renewed and know His touch of pow’r.
Yes, we would see Jesus thru the Scriptures shining;
Lord, lift the veil of earthly sense and meet us in this hour.
We beheld His glory, thus when homeward wending,
Our hearts will echo with the of redeeming love.
We beheld His glory, and go forth to serve Him,
Till faith gives way to joyous sight in mansions up above.

Had he not loved us
he had never come;
yet is he love
and love is all his way:
low to the mystery
of the Virgin's womb
Christ bows his glory--
born on Christmas Day.
Had he not loved us
he had never come;
had he not come
he need have never died,
nor won the victory
of the vacant tomb,
the awful triumph
of the Crucified.
Had he not loved us
he had never come;
still we were lost
in sorrow, sin and shame,
the doors fast shut
on our eternal home
which now stand open--
for he loved and came.

Hail this glorious Easter morning,
Night has fled away,
O’er the eastern hills the dawning
Breaks in light of day.
Sun and cloud their beauty blending,
Easter mem’ries sing,
Flowers sweet their fragrance lending,
Hail with your joy your risen King!
Hail, all hail this Easter morning,
Hail, all hail this day of days!
Hail, all hail the sight adorning;
Hail, all hail the songs of praise!
Hail! O earth, your risen Savior,
For today He rose—
Conqueror of death forever,
Triumphed o’er His foes.
Hail again your Savior glorious,
Richest tribute bring;
Over all the world victorious,
Hail, all hail your risen King!
Sound aloud the Easter ,
Send the news afar,
While in glory shining o’er us,
Beams our Morning Star.
Songs of joy, and peace, and gladness,
Let our voices sing;
Cheer each heart and banish sadness,
While we hail our risen King.

Hail, co-essential Three,
In mystic Unity!
Father, Son, and Spirit, hail!
God by Heaven and earth adored,
God incomprehensible;
One supreme, almighty Lord,
One supreme, almighty Lord.
Thou sittest on the throne,
Plurality in One;
Saints behold Thine open face,
Bright, insufferably bright;
Angels tremble as they gaze,
Sink into a sea of light,
Sink into a sea of light.
Ah! when shall we increase
Their heavenly ecstasies?
Chant, like them, the Lord Most High,
Fall like them who dare not move;
“Holy, holy, holy," cry,
Breathe the praise of silent love?
Breathe the praise of silent love?
Come, Father, in the Son
And in the Spirit down;
Glorious Triune Majesty,
God through endless ages blest,
Make us meet Thy face to see,
Then receive us to Thy breast;
Then receive us to Thy breast.

Hail! Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
One God, in Persons Three!
Of Thee we make our joyful boast,
Our songs we make of Thee.
Thou neither canst be felt nor seen,
Thou art a Spirit pure;
Thou from eternity hast been,
And always shalt endure.
Present alike in every place,
Thy Godhead we adore;
Beyond the bounds of time and space,
Thou dwell’st for evermore.
In wisdom infinite Thou art,
Thine eye doth all things see;
And every thought of every heart
Is fully known to thee.
Thou lov’st whate’er Thy hands have made;
Thy goodness we rehearse,
In shining characters displayed
Throughout our universe.
Mercy, with love and endless grace,
O’er all Thy works doth reign;
But mostly Thou delight’st to bless
Thy favorite creature, Man.
Wherefore, let every creature give
To Thee the praise designed;
But chiefly, Lord, the thanks receive,
The hearts of all mankind.

Hail, Father, whose creating call
Unnumbered worlds attend;
Jehovah, comprehending all,
Whom none can comprehend!
In light unsearchable enthroned,
Whom angels dimly see,
The fountain of the Godhead owned,
And foremost of the Three.
From Thee, through an eternal now,
The Son, Thine offspring, flowed;
An everlasting Father Thou,
An everlasting God.
Nor quite displayed to worlds above,
Nor quite on earth concealed;
By wondrous, unexhausted love,
To mortal man revealed.
Supreme and all-sufficient God,
When nature shall expire,
And worlds created by Thy nod
Shall perish by Thy fire.
Thy Name, Jehovah, be adored
By creatures without end,
Whom none but Thy essential Word
And Spirit comprehend.

Hail, festal day! to endless ages known,
when God ascended to his starry throne.
Now with Lord, of new and heavenly birth,
his gifts return to grace the springing earth.
Now glows the year, with painted flowers' array,
and warmer light unbars the gates of day.
Now Christ, from gloomy hell, comes triumphing,
and field and grove with flower and leafage spring.
The reign of death o'erthrown, he mounts on high,
sent forth with joyous praise from sea and sky.
Loose now the captives, loose the prison door,
the fallen, from the deep, to light restore.
A countless people from death's fetters free,
own thee Redeemer, join and follow thee.
Creator and Redeemer! Christ our Light!
The One-begotten of the Father's might.
Co-equal, co-eternal, thou to whom
the kingdom of the world decreed shall come.
Thou, looking on our race in darkness laid,
to rescue man, true man thyself wast made.

Hail, gladdening Light, of His pure glory poured,
Who is immortal Father, heavenly blest;
Highest and holiest—Jesus Christ our Lord!
Now are we come to the sun’s hour of rest;
All times are ordered in Thy Word alone,
Therefore the day and night Thy glories own.
The lights of evening now around us shine;
We hymn Thy blest humanity divine;
Worthiest art Thou at all times to be sung,
By grateful hearts, with undefiled tongue,
Son of our God, Giver of life, alone!
Therefore shall all the worlds Thy glories own.

Hail, harbinger of morn:
thou that art this day born,
and heraldest the Word with clarion voice!
Ye faithful ones, in him
behold the dawning dim
of the bright day, and let your hearts rejoice.
John--by that chosen name
to call him, Gabriel came
by God's appointment from his home on high:
what deeds that babe should do
to manhood when he grew,
God sent his Angel forth to testify.
There is none greater, none,
than Zechariah's son;
than this no mightier prophet hath been born:
of prophets he may claim
more than a prophet's fame;
sublimer deeds than theirs his brow adorn.
"Lo, to prepare thy way,"
did God the Father say,
"Before thy face my messenger I send,
thy coming to forerun;
as on the orient sun
doth the bright daystar morn by morn attend."
Praise therefore God most high;
praise him who came to die
for us, his Son that liveth evermore;
and to the Spirit raise,
the Comforter, like praise,
while time endureth, and when time is o'er.

Tell it to every kindred and nation,
Tell it far and near;
Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,
Jesus will soon appear.
Hail Him the King of glory,
Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
Tell, tell the wondrous story,
“Jesus comes to reign."
Nations again in strife and commotion,
Warnings by the way;
Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,
Herald the glorious day.
Children of God look up with rejoicing;
Shout and sing His praise;
Blessed are they who, waiting and watching,
Look for the dawning rays.

Hail! Holy, holy, holy Lord!
Whom One in Three we know;
By all thy heavenly host adored,
By all thy church below.
One undivided Trinity
With triumph we proclaim;
Thy universe is full of thee,
And speaks thy glorious name.
Thee, Holy Father, we confess,
Thee, Holy Son, adore,
Thee, Spir't of truth and holiness,
We worship evermore.
Three Persons equally divine
We magnify and love;
And both the choirs ere long shall join,
To sing thy praise above.
Hail! holy, holy, holy Lord,
Our heavenly song shall be,
Supreme, essential One, adored
In co-eternal Three!

Hail, holy Light! The world rejoices
As morning breaks and shadows fly;
All nature blends her myriad voices
To greet the dayspring from on high,
To greet the dayspring from on high.
Break forth, in glory far excelling,
O Light eternal, Love divine!
Let Thy bright beams, all shades dispelling,
Around us and within us shine,
Around us and within us shine.
The heav’nly hosts fall down before Thee,
And “Holy!" cry, nor ever rest;
The saints on earth, with them, adore Thee,
Creator, Savior, Spirit blest,
Creator, Savior, Spirit blest.
O God, if we could duly praise Thee,
Could we but voice the love we see,
As sweet as song as angels raise Thee,
Our Sabbath morning hymn should be,
Our Sabbath morning hymn should be.
Accept, O Father, we entreat Thee,
The worship which Thy children bring;
O, grant us grace in Heav’n to greet Thee,
And with all saints Thy love to sing,
And with all saints Thy love to sing.

Hail holy queen enthroned above,
Oh Maria.
Hail mother of mercy and of love,
Oh Maria.
Triumph all ye cherubim,
Sing with us ye seraphim.
Heaven and earth resound the hymn.
Salve, salve, salve regina.:| 
Our life, our sweetness here below,
Oh, oh, oh, oh Maria.
Our hope in sorrow and in woe;
Oh, oh, oh, Maria.
Triumph all ye cherubim cherubim
Sing with us ye seraphim seraphim
Heaven and earth resound the hymn
Salve, salve, salve regina.
Al le lu ia

Virgo, respice; mater, adspice;
Sanctus, sanctus, Dominus! 
Al le lu ia 
Our life, our sweetness here below,
Oh, oh, oh, oh Maria
Our hope in sorrow and in woe;
Oh, oh, oh, Maria
Triumph all ye cherubim cherubim

Heaven and earth resound the hymn
Salve, salve, salve regina
salve regina, salve regi na.

Hail, mighty Victor! Behold He comes from out the grave.
Shout, shout His triumph! Oh, tell abroad His power to save.
Sing, sing with gladness, proclaim the news o’er land and sea:
He reigns forever, great Ruler over all is He.
Shout His praise, for us He came to die.
But lo, He lives!
He reigns upon His Father’s throne on high.
Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the Lord be given.
Praise Him! all ye people, mighty Ruler of earth and Heav’n.
Praise Him! all ye stars of night.
Praise Him! all ye shining hosts of light.
Oh! that men would bless and praise His holy Name,
Would praise His holy Name.
[

Hail! my ever blessed Jesus,
Only Thee I wish to sing;
To my soul Thy Name is precious,
Thou my Prophet, Priest and King.
O what mercy flows from Heaven!
O what joy and happiness!
Love I much? I’m much forgiven
I’m a miracle of grace.
Once with Adam’s race in ruin,
Unconcerned in sin I lay;
Swift destruction still pursuing,
Till my Savior passed that way.
Witness, all ye hosts of Heaven,
My Redeemer’s tenderness;
Love I much? I’m much forgiven,
I’m a miracle of grace.
Shout, ye bright angelic choir,
Praise the Lamb enthroned above;
Whilst astonished I admire
God’s free grace and boundless love.
That blest moment I received Him,
Filled my soul with joy and peace;
Love I much? I’m much forgiven,
I’m a miracle of grace.

'Hail, O Mary, full of grace,
Daughter true of David's race!
Thou, of women first and best,
Art beyond all others blest.
Fear not, thou shalt bear a Son,
Aided by the Holy One;
Greater than the greatest, he
Son of God most high shall be.'
Thus the holy angel said.
Blessed Mary bowed her head:
'Lo, the handmaid of the Lord;
With his word may all accord.'
So to hearts still undefiled
Comes the promise of a child,
Full of joy, akin to tears,
Full of hope, yet full of fears.
Happy she who answers still,
'Be it, Lord, at thy sweet will;
All I am to thee I owe,
All thy purpose thou dost know.
What thou givest to be mine,
May it ne'er be aught but thine;
Be it good or be it ill,
Still be all at thy sweet will.'
Holy Mary, taught by thee
Let us vain forebodings flee.
God is giving; fears must cease:
In his will is perfect peace.

Hail! princes of the host of heaven,
To whom by Christ your Chief 'tis given
On shining thrones to sit on high,
And judge the world with equity.
Through you was borne the Gospel light
To those who lay in sin's dark night;
That Christ, the Life, the Truth, the Way,
Might lead them to eternal day.
Not in the power of earthly sword
Or arts of speech ye preached the Lord:
The Cross, the Cross which men despise,
'Twas this achieved your victories.
And now to God, the Three in One,
Be highest praise and glory done,
Who calls us from the gloom of night
To share the glory of his light.

Hail The Blest Morn! When The Great Mediator
Down from the regions of glory descends;
Shepherds! Go worship the Lord in the manger,
Lo! For His guards the bright angels attend.
Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid.
Star in the east! The horizon adorning,
Guide where the infant Redeemer is laid.
Lo! On His cradle the dew-drops are shining,
Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall;
Angels adore Him with slumbers reclining,
Maker, Redeemer, and Savior of all.
Say, shall we yield Him some costly devotion,
Odors of Eden, and off'rings divine?
Gems from the mountain, and pearls from the ocean,
Myrrh from the forest, and gold from the mine?
Vainly we offer each ample oblation
Vainly with gold would His favor secure;
Richer by far is the heart's adoration,
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

Hail the day that sees Him rise, Alleluia!
To His throne above the skies, Alleluia!
Christ, awhile to mortals given, Alleluia!
Reascends His native heaven, Alleluia!
There the glorious triumph waits, Alleluia!
Lift your heads, eternal gates, Alleluia!
Christ hath conquered death and sin, Alleluia!
Take the King of glory in, Alleluia!
Circled round with angel powers, Alleluia!
Their triumphant Lord, and ours, Alleluia!
Conqueror over death and sin, Alleluia!
“Take the King of glory in! Alleluia!"
Him though highest Heav’n receives, Alleluia!
Still He loves the earth He leaves, Alleluia!
Though returning to His throne, Alleluia!
Still He calls mankind His own, Alleluia!
See! He lifts His hands above, Alleluia!
See! He shows the prints of love, Alleluia!
Hark! His gracious lips bestow, Alleluia!
Blessings on His church below, Alleluia!
Still for us His death He pleads, Alleluia!
Prevalent He intercedes, Alleluia!
Near Himself prepares our place, Alleluia!
Harbinger of human race, Alleluia!
Master, (will we ever say), Alleluia!
Taken from our head to day, Alleluia!
See Thy faithful servants, see, Alleluia!
Ever gazing up to Thee, Alleluia!
Grant, though parted from our sight, Alleluia!
Far above yon azure height, Alleluia!
Grant our hearts may thither rise, Alleluia!
Seeking Thee beyond the skies, Alleluia!
Ever upward let us move, Alleluia!
Wafted on the wings of love, Alleluia!
Looking when our Lord shall come, Alleluia!
Longing, gasping after home, Alleluia!
There we shall with Thee remain, Alleluia!
Partners of Thy endless reign, Alleluia!
There Thy face unclouded see, Alleluia!
Find our heaven of heavens in Thee, Alleluia.

Hail the glorious golden city,
Pictured by the seers of old!
Everlasting light shines o’er it,
Wondrous tales of it are told:
Only righteous men and women
Dwell within its gleaming wall;
Wrong is banished from its borders,
Justice reigns supreme o’er all.
We are builders of that city,
All our joys and all our groans
Help to rear its shining ramparts;
All our lives are building stones:
Whether humble or exalted,
All are called to task divine;
All must aid alike to carry
Forward one sublime design.
And the work that we have builded,
Oft with bleeding hands and tears,
Oft in error, oft in anguish,
Will not perish with our years:
It will live and shine transfigured,
In the final reign of right;
It will pass into the splendors
Of the city of the light.

Hail the sign, the sign of Jesus,
bright and royal tree!
Standard of the Monarch, planted
first on Calvary!
Hail the sign all signs excelling,
hail the sign all ills dispelling,
hail the sign hell's power quelling,
Cross of Christ, all hail!
Sign the martyrs' strength and refuge,
sign to saints so dear!
Sign of evil men abhorred,
sign which devils fear: 
Sign which, when the Lord returneth,
in the heavens shall be;
sinners quail, while saints with rapture
shall the vision see: 
Lo, I sign the cross of Jesus
meekly on my breast;
may it guard my heart when living,
dying be its rest: 
In the name of God the Father, 
Name of God the Son,
Name of God the blessed Spirit,
Ever Three in One: 

EASTER
Hail thee, festival day!
Blessed day to be hallowed forever;
Day when our Lord was raised,
Breaking the kingdom of death.
Lo, the fair beauty of the earth,
From the death of the winter arising!
Every good gift of the year
Now with its Master returns.
Rise from the grave now, O Lord,
The author of life and creation.
Treading the pathway of death,
New life You give to us all.

ASCENSION
Hail thee, festival day!
Blessed day to be hallowed forever;

Adorned with glory of blossom;
Heaven her gates unbars,
Flinging her increase of light.

PENTECOST
Hail thee, festival day!
Blessed day to be hallowed forever;
Day when the Holy Ghost
Shone in the world full of grace.

On those who await your appearing,

Suddenly, swiftly descend.
Forth from the Father You come
With sevenfold mystical offering,
Pouring on all human souls
Infinite riches of God.

ALL OCCASIONS
God the Almighty Lord,
The Ruler of earth and the heavens,
Guard us from harm without;
Cleanse us from evil within.
Jesus the health of the world,
Enlighten our minds, great Redeemer,
Son of the Father supreme,
Only begotten of God.
Spirit of life and of power,
Now flow in us, fount of our being,
Light that enlightens us all,
Life that in all may abide.
Praise to the giver of good!
O lover and author of concord,
Pour out your balm on our days;
Order our ways in your peace.

Now the earth, in joy awaking
From the sleep of winter drear,
Tells the story of His glory;
How He rose the Lord so dear.
Ev'ry soul sing alleluia;
Ev'ry heart be light and gay.
Alleluia, alleluia,
Hail this blessed Easter Day!
Children, come! With sweet rejoicing

Alleluia, alleluia,
Hail this blessed Easter Day!

Hail this joyful day's return,

blessings of this sacred day

You who did our forebears guide,
with their children still abide;
grant us pardon, grant us peace,
till our earthly wanderings cease.Alleluia!

Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morning!
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning;
Zion in triumph begins her mild reign.
Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morning!
Long by the prophets of Israel foretold!
Hail to the millions from bondage returning!
Gentiles and Jews the blest vision behold.
Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing,
Streams ever copious are gliding along;
Loud from the mountain tops echoes are ringing,
Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song.
See, from all lands, from the isles of the ocean,
Praise to the Savior ascending on high;
Fallen the engines of war and commotion;
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.

Hail to the Lord Who comes,
Comes to His temple gate;
Not with His angel host,
Not in His kingly state;
No shouts proclaim Him nigh,
No crowds His coming wait.
But, borne upon the throne
Of Mary’s gentle breast,
Watched by her duteous love,
In her fond arms at rest,
Thus to His Father’s house
He comes, the heav’nly Guest.
There Joseph at her side
In reverent wonder stands,
And, filled with holy joy,
Old Simeon in his hands
Takes up the promised Child,
The Glory of all lands.
Hail to the great First-born
Whose ransom price they pay!
The Son before all worlds,
The Child of man today,
That He might ransom us
Who still in bondage lay.
O Light of all the earth,
Thy children wait for Thee!
Come to Thy temples here,
That we, from sin set free,
Before Thy Father’s face
May all presented be!

Hail to the Lord’s anointed, great David’s greater Son!
Hail in the time appointed, His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression, to set the captive free;
To take away transgression and rule in equity.
He comes in succor speedy to those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy, and bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing, their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying, were precious in His sight.
By such shall He be feared while sun and moon endure;
Beloved, obeyed, revered; for He shall judge the poor
Through changing generations, with justice, mercy, truth,
While stars maintain their stations, or moons renew their youth.
He shall come down like showers upon the fruitful earth;
Love, joy, and hope, like flowers, spring in His path to birth.
Before Him, on the mountains, shall peace, the herald, go,
And righteousness, in fountains, from hill to valley flow.
Arabia’s desert ranger to Him shall bow the knee;
The Ethiopian stranger His glory come to see;
With offerings of devotion ships from the isles shall meet,
To pour the wealth of oceans in tribute at His feet.
Kings shall fall down before Him, and gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him, His praise all people sing;
For He shall have dominion o’er river, sea and shore,
Far as the eagle’s pinion or dove’s light wing can soar.
For Him shall prayer unceasing and daily vows ascend;
His kingdom still increasing, a kingdom without end:
The mountain dews shall nourish a seed in weakness sown,
Whose fruit shall spread and flourish and shake like Lebanon.
O’er every foe victorious, He on His throne shall rest;
From age to age more glorious, all blessing and all blest.
The tide of time shall never His covenant remove;
His Name shall stand forever, His Name to us is Love.

Hail to the Prince of life and peace,
Who holds the keys of death and hell!
The spacious world unseen is His,
And sovereign power becomes Him well.
In shame and torment once He died,
But now He lives forevermore;
Bow down, ye saints, around His seat,
And all ye angel bands, adore.
So live forever, glorious Lord,
To crush Thy foes and guard Thy friends!
While all Thy chosen tribes rejoice
That Thy dominion never ends.
Worthy Thy hands to hold the keys,
Guided by wisdom and by love;
Worthy to rule o’er mortal life,
O’er worlds below and worlds above.
Forever reign, victorious King!
Wide through the earth Thy Name is known;
And call my longing soul to sing
Sublimer anthems near Thy throne.

Hail to the Sabbath day!
The day divinely given,
When men to God their homage pay,
And earth draws near to Heaven.
Lord, in this sacred hour,
Within Thy courts we bend,
And bless Thy love, and own Thy power,
Our Father and our Friend.
But Thou art not alone
In courts by mortals trod;
Nor only is the day Thine own
When man draws near to God.
Thy temple is the arch
Of yon unmeasured sky;
Thy Sabbath, the stupendous march
Of vast eternity.
Lord, may that holier day
Dawn on Thy servants’ sight;
And purer worship may we pay
In Heaven’s unclouded light.

Hail, Virgin, dearest Mary!
Our lovely Queen of May,
O spotless blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
Thy children humbly bending,
A round thy shrine so dear;
With heart and voice ascending,
Sweet Mary hear our prayer.
Hail, Virgin, dearest Mary!
Our lovely Queen of May,
O spotless blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
Behold earth's blossoms springing,
In beauteous form and hue;
All nature gladly bringing,
Her sweetest charms to you.
Hail, Virgin, dearest Mary!
Our lovely Queen of May,
O spotless blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
We'll gather fresh, bright flowers,
To bind our fair Queen's brow;
From gay and verdant bowers,
We haste to crown the now.
Hail, Virgin, dearest Mary!
Our lovely Queen of May,
O spotless blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
And now our blesed Mother,
Smile on our festal day;
Accept our wreath of flowers,
And be our Queen of May.
Hail, Virgin, dearest Mary!
Our lovely Queen of May,
O spotless blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.

Hail! Ye Foll'wers of the Lamb 
Ye who love the Savior's name,
Who are cleansed by pard'ning blood,
Go with us, the way is good.
Glories bright we have in view,
While we on our way pursue;
March with joy the heav'nly road,
Go with us, the way is good.
Doubting souls, dismiss your fears,
Mourning souls, dry up your tears;
Christ for you has spilt His blood,
Go with is, the way is good.
Burdened souls, oppressed with grief,
Jesus freely grants relief;
He'll remove your heavy load,
Go with us, the way is good.
Ye who know your Savior's love,
Now your faithfulness approve;
Follow Him in Jordan's flood,
Go with us, the way is good.
Saints, begin the heav'nly song,
Join in concert, every tongue;
Walk with joy the heav'nly road,
Go with is, the way is good.

Hail, ye sighing sons of sorrow,
View with me th'autumnal gloom,
Learn from thence your fate to-morrow;
Dead perhaps, laid in the tomb.
See all nature fading, dying,
Silent, all things seem to mourn,
Life from vegetation flying,
Brings to mind the mould'ring urn.
Oft when autumn's tempest rising,a Makes the lofty forest nod,
Scenes of nature how surprising,
Read in nature nature's God.
See the sov'reign, sole Creator,
Lives eternal in the skies,
Whilst we mortals yield to nature,
Bloom awhile, then fade and die.
Lo! I hear the air resounding,
With expiring insects' cries;
Ah! their moans to me how wounding,
Emblems of my age and sighs,
Hollow winds about me roaring,
Noisy waters round me rise,
Whilst I sit my fate deploring,
Tears fast streaming from my eyes.
What to me is autumn's treasure,
Since I know no earthly joy?
Long I've lost all youthful pleasure,
Time must youth and health destroy.
Pleasures once I fondly courted,
Shared each bliss that health bestows,
But to see where then I sported,
Now embitters all my woes.
Age and sorrow since have blasted
Ev'ry youthful, pleasing dream;
Quiv'ring age with youth contrasted,
O, how short their glories seem!
As the annual frosts are cropping
Leaves and tendrils from the trees,
So my friends are yearly dropping,
Through old age and dire disease.
Former friends, O, how I've sought them!
Just to cheer my drooping mind;
But they're gone like leaves in autumn,
Driv'n before a dreary wind.
Sping and summer, fall and winter,
Each in swift succession roll,
So my friends in death do enter,
Bringing sadness to my soul.
Death has laid them down to slumber;
Solemn thought to think that I
Soon must be one of that number!
Soon--ah, soon, with them lie!
When a few more years are wasted,
When a few more scenes are o'er,
When a few more griefs are tasted,
I shall fall to rise no more.
Fast sun of life declining,
Soon will set in endless night;
But my hope, pure and refining,
Rests in future life and light.
Cease this fearing, trembling, sighing,
Death will break the sudden gloom;
Soon my spirit, flutt'ring, flying,
Must be borne beyond the tomb.

Hail! sacred day of earthly rest,
From toil and trouble free:
Hail! day of light, that bringest light
And joy to me.
A holy stillness, breathing calm
On all the world around,
Uplifts my soul, O God, to Thee,
Where rest is found.
On all I think, or say, or do,
A ray of light divine
Is shed, O God, this day by Thee,
For it is Thine.
No sound of jarring strife is heard,
As weekly labors cease;
No voice, but those that sweetly sing
Sweet songs of peace.
For those who sings with saints below
Glad songs of heavenly love,
Shall sing—when songs on earth have ceased—
With saints above.
Accept, O God, my hymn of praise,
That Thou, this day, hast given
Sweet foretaste of that endless day
Of rest in Heaven.

Hail, Body true, of Mary born, and in the manger laid,
That once with thorn and scourging torn wast on the cross displayed,
That every eye might there descry th’uplifted Sacrifice,
Which once for all to God on high paid our redemption’s price!
Hail, precious Blood, by true descent drawn from our own first sire,
Yet innocent of that fell taint which fills our veins with fire,
Once from the side of Him that died for love of us His kin,
Drained an atonement to provide and wash away our sin!
Still Thou art here amidst us, Lord, unchangeably the same;
When at Thy board with one accord Thy promises we claim;
But lo! the way Thou com’st today is one where bread and wine
Conceal the Presence they convey, both human and divine.
How glorious is that Body now, throned on the Throne of Heav’n!
The angels bow, and marvel how to us on earth ’tis given;
Oh, to discern what splendors burn within these veils of His—
That faith could into vision turn, and see Him as He is!
How mighty is the Blood that ran for sinful nature’s needs!
It broke the ban, it rescued man; it lives, and speaks, and pleads;
And all who sup from this blest Cup in faith and hope and love,
Shall prove that death is swallowed up in richer life above.

Hail happy morning, hail, holy day,
Calling from earthly labors away,
Sweet words of wisdom, glad songs of joy,
Now be our best employ.
Sing once more the happy, happy song,
While the golden moments roll along,
“Come to the temple, come, come away,
Hallow the Sabbath day."
Emblem of heaven, sweet day of rest,
In thy “remembrance," may we be blessed.
So may our songs and lives ever say,
“Hallow the Sabbath day."
Rest from our labors, rest from our cares,
Rest in our praises, rest in our prayers,
So the commandment would we obey,
“Hallow the Sabbath day."

Hail, holy Light! The world rejoices
As morning breaks and shadows fly;
All nature blends her myriad voices
To greet the dayspring from on high,
To greet the dayspring from on high.
Break forth, in glory far excelling,
O Light eternal, Love divine!
Let Thy bright beams, all shades dispelling,
Around us and within us shine,
Around us and within us shine.
The heav’nly hosts fall down before Thee,
And “Holy!" cry, nor ever rest;
The saints on earth, with them, adore Thee,
Creator, Savior, Spirit blest,
Creator, Savior, Spirit blest.
O God, if we could duly praise Thee,
Could we but voice the love we see,
As sweet as song as angels raise Thee,
Our Sabbath morning hymn should be,
Our Sabbath morning hymn should be.
Accept, O Father, we entreat Thee,
The worship which Thy children bring;
O, grant us grace in Heav’n to greet Thee,
And with all saints Thy love to sing,
And with all saints Thy love to sing.

Hail, O star that pointest
Towards the port of Heaven,
Thou to whom as maiden
God for Son was given.
When the salutation
Gabriel had spoken,
Peace was shed upon us,
Eva’s bonds were broken.
Bound by Satan’s fetters,
Health and vision needing,
God will aid and light us
At thy gentle pleading.
Jesu’s tender mother,
Make thy supplication
Unto Him Who chose thee
At His incarnation;
That, O matchless maiden,
Passing meek and lowly,
Thy dear Son may make us
Blameless, chaste and holy.
So, as now we journey
Aid our weak endeavor,
Till we gaze on Jesus,
And rejoice forever.
Father, Son and Spirit,
Three in One confessing,
Give we equal glory,

Hail, sovereign love that first began,
The scheme to rescue fallen man;
Hail matchless free eternal grace,
That gave my soul a hiding place.
Against the God who rules the sky,
I fought with hand uplifted high,
Despised the mention of His grace,
Too proud to seek a hiding place.
Enwrapped in thick Egyptian night,
And fond of darkness more than light,
Madly I ran the sinful race,
Secure without a hiding place.
But thus th’ eternal counsel ran,
“Almighty Love, arrest that man!"
I felt the arrows of distress,
And found I had no hiding place.
Indignant justice stood in view,
To Sinai’s fiery mount I flew,
But Justice cried with frowning face,
“This mountain is no hiding place!"
Ere long a heavenly voice I heard,
And Mercy’s angel form appeared.
Who led me on with gentle pace,
To Jesus Christ, my hiding place.
On Him Almighty vengeance fell,
That must have sunk a world to hell;
He bore it for a chosen race,
And thus became their hiding place.
Should storms of sevenfold vengeance roll,
And shake this earth from pole to pole;
No flaming bolt could daunt my face,
For Jesus is my hiding place.
A few more rolling suns at most,
Shall land me safe on Heaven’s coast.
There I shall sing the song of grace,
To Jesus Christ, my hiding place!

Hail, thou bright and sacred morn,
Ris’n with gladness in thy beams!
Light, which not of earth is born,
From thy dawn in glory streams;
Airs of Heav’n are breathed around,
And each place is holy ground.
Sad and weary were our way,
Fainting oft beneath our load,
But for thee, thou blessed day,
Resting place on life’s rough road;
Here flow forth the streams of grace;
Strengthened hence we run our race.
Great Creator, Who this day
From Thy perfect work didst rest,
By the souls that own Thy sway
Hallowed be its hours and blest;
Cares of earth aside be thrown,
This day give to Heav’n alone.
Savior, Who this day didst break
The dark prison of the tomb,
Bid my slumbering soul awake;
Shine through all its sin and gloom;
Let me, from my bonds set free,
Rise from sin, and live to Thee.
Blessed Spirit, Comforter,
Sent this day from Christ on high;
Lord, on me Thy gifts confer,
Cleanse, illumine, sanctify:
All Thine influence shed abroad;
Let me to the truth of God.

Hail, Thou once despised Jesus! Hail, Thou Galilean King!
Thou didst suffer to release us; Thou didst free salvation bring.
Hail, Thou universal Savior, Who hast borne our sin and shame!
By Thy merits we find favor; life is given through Thy Name.
Paschal Lamb, by God appointed, all our sins on Thee were laid;
By almighty love anointed, Thou hast full atonement made.
Every sin may be forgiven through the virtue of Thy blood;
Opened is the gate of heaven, reconciled are we with God.
Jesus, hail! enthroned in glory, there forever to abide;
All the heavenly hosts adore Thee, seated at Thy Father’s side.
There for sinners Thou art pleading; there Thou dost our place prepare;
Thou for saints art interceding till in glory they appear.
Worship, honor, power and blessing Christ is worthy to receive;
Loudest praises, without ceasing, right it is for us to give.
Help, ye bright angelic spirits, bring your sweetest, noblest lays;
Help to sing of Jesus’ merits, help to chant Emmanuel’s praise!

Hail, Thou Source of every blessing,
Sovereign Father of mankind!
Gentiles now, Thy grace possessing,
In Thy courts admission find.
Grateful now we fall before Thee,
In Thy Church obtain a place,
Now by faith behold Thy glory,
Praise Thy truth, adore Thy grace.
Once far off, but now invited,
We approach Thy sacred throne;
In Thy covenant united,
Reconciled, redeemed, made one.
Now revealed to Eastern sages,
See the Star of Mercy shine;
Mystery hid in former ages,
Mystery great of love divine.
Hail, Thou all-inviting Savior!
Gentiles now their offerings bring;
In Thy temple seek Thy favor,
Jesus Christ, our Lord and King.
May we, body, soul, and spirit,
Live devoted to Thy praise,
Glorious realms of bliss inherit,
Grateful anthems ever raise!

Hail! sweetest, dearest tie that binds
Our glowing hearts in one;
Hail sacred hope, that tunes our minds
To harmony divine.
It is the hope, the blissful hope,
Which Jesus’ grace has giv’n;
The hope when days and years are passed,
We all shall meet in Heav’n.
What though the northern wintry blast
Shall howl around thy cot,
What though beneath an eastern sun,
Be cast our distant lot;
Yet still we share the blissful hope!
No lingering hope, no parting sigh,
Our future meetings knows;
The friendship beams from every eye,
And hope immortal grows,
O sacred hope! O blissful hope!

Hallelujah, Jesus is Lord
Hallelujah, death is no more
Hallelujah, hope is restored
Hallelujah, Jesus is Lord
He was dead in the grave
And all hope had vanished away
He arose; He’s alive
And I’m ready to shout it on high ()
I was dead in my sins
Bound for hell and darkness within
By His love, I’m alive
Heaven’s gates are opened wide ()
We’re alive in the Son
Longing for the day He will come
In a flash, trumpet blast
Christ the Victor will raise us at last !
Hallelujah, Jesus is Lord !!

Heart and voice to Heaven raise,
Sing to God a hymn of gladness,
Sing to God a hymn of praise;
He Who on the cross a ransom
For the world’s salvation bled,
Jesus Christ the King of glory
Now is risen from the dead.
Christ is risen, Christ the firstfruits
Of the holy harvest field,
Which will all its full abundance,
At His glorious advent, yield;
Then the golden ears of harvest
Will before His presence wave,
Rising in His sunshine joyous,
From the furrow of the grave.
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Glory be to God above!
Hallelujah, to the Savior,
Fount of life and source of love;
Hallelujah, to the Spirit
Let our high ascriptions be;
Hallelujah, now and ever,
To the blessed Trinity.

The cross, it standeth fast—
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Defying every blast—
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
The winds of hell have blown,
The world its hate hath shown,
Yet it is not overthrown—
Hallelujah for the cross!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah for the cross;
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
It shall never suffer loss!
It is the old cross still—
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Its triumph let us tell—
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
The grace of God here shone
Thru Christ, the blessed Son,
Who did for sin atone—
Hallelujah for the cross!
’Twas here the debt was paid—
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Our sins on Jesus laid—
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
So round the cross we sing
Of Christ, our offering,
Of Christ, our living King—
Hallelujah for the cross!

Long mine eyes were drowned in tears,
And my soul was filled with fears,
And I heeded not the swiftly passing years;
For thro’ many a weary day,
O’er a long and desert way
From the fold of Christ, my Shepherd, I did stray.
Hallelujah! Jesus saves me,
And my head is sweetly pillowed on His breast;
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
His shekinah covers me and I am blest.
Now I doubt and fear no more,
All my heart with bliss runs o’er,
And I can but love Him, praise Him and adore;
Skies above me never lower,
Bright is every fleeting hour,
And I sing the day of Jesus’ mighty power.
O how precious is His grace!
O to come to that fair place
Where our souls may drink the light of His dear face!
There before His shining seat
All his sainted ones shall meet,
Casting down their crowns before His pierced feet.
Will you join us, brother dear,
While His voice of love and cheer
Now is calling you—O hasten to His side;
Every day you wait is lost,
Sad will be the fearful cost,
If you blindly spurn at last the Crucified.

Hallelujah unto Jesus!
Now He lives to die no more;
Let all nations sing His praises,
Gladly sing them o’er and o’er.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! to our King!
From the tomb today He’s risen,
Hallelujah we’ll sing.
Hallelujah unto Jesus!
Who for us once bled, and died,
He is now o’er death, the Victor,
Hail Him King the Crucified.
Hallelujah unto Jesus!
Blessed firstfruits of the dead;
He our resurrection Surety,
Lives for us our risen King.
Hallelujah unto Jesus!
Death is robbed now of its sting;
And the tomb for us lighted,
Hallelujah to our King.

I now have the Spirit that setteth me free,
Hallelujah!
My Savior’s own presence abideth with me,
Hallelujah!
Oh, hallelujah! hallelujah!
I am glad to tell,
Oh, hallelujah! hallelujah!
With my soul ’tis well.
No longer I’m doubting His power to save,
Hallelujah!
The pleasures of earth I no longer now crave,
Hallelujah!
So glad I can trust Him I cannot but shout,
Hallelujah!
The inbred corruption is all taken out,
Hallelujah!
My Savior is with me each day in the year,
Hallelujah!
A constant Companion, I’ve nothing to fear,
Hallelujah!

Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Heart and voice to Heaven raise,
Sing to God a hymn of gladness,
Sing to God a hymn of praise;
He Who on the cross a ransom
For the world’s salvation bled,
Jesus Christ the King of glory
Now is risen from the dead.
Christ is risen, Christ the firstfruits
Of the holy harvest field,
Which will all its full abundance,
At His glorious advent, yield;
Then the golden ears of harvest
Will before His presence wave,
Rising in His sunshine joyous,
From the furrow of the grave.
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Glory be to God above!
Hallelujah, to the Savior,
Fount of life and source of love;
Hallelujah, to the Spirit
Let our high ascriptions be;
Hallelujah, now and ever,
To the blessed Trinity.

Hallelujah! Jesus lives!
He is now the Living One;
From the gloomy halls of death
Christ, the conqueror, has gone,
Bright forerunner to the skies
Of His people, yet to rise.
Jesus lives! Why do you weep?
Why that sad and mournful sigh?
He who died our Brother here
Lives our Brother still on high.
Lives forever to bestow
Blessings on His church below.
Jesus lives! And thus, my soul,
Life eternal waits for you;
Joined to Him, your living head,
Where He is, you shall be, too;
With the Lord, at His right hand,
As a victor you shall stand.
Jesus lives! Let all rejoice.
Praise Him, ransomed of the earth.
Praise Him in a nobler song,
Cherubim of heavenly birth.
Praise the victor King, Whose sway
Sin and death and hell obey.
Jesus lives! To Him my heart
Draws with ever new delight.
Earthly vanities, depart,
Hinder not my heavenward flight.
Let this spirit ever rise
To its Magnet in the skies.
Hallelujah! Angels, sing!
Join with us in hymns of praise.
Let your swell the strain
Which our feebler voices raise;
Glory to our God above
And on earth His peace and love!

Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
To God the Father let us bring
Our songs of adoration.
To Him through everlasting days
Be worship, honor, power and praise,
Whose hand sustains creation.
Singing, ringing: Holy, holy, God is holy,
Spread the story of our God, the Lord of Glory.
Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
Unto the Lamb of God we sing,
In Whom we are elected.
He bought His Church with His own blood,
He cleansed her in that blessed flood,
And as His bride selected.
Holy, holy is our union and communion,
His befriending gives us joy and peace unending.
Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
Unto the Holy Ghost we sing
For our regeneration.
The saving faith in us He wrought
And us unto the Bridegroom brought,
Made us His chosen nation.
Glory! Glory! Joy eternal, bliss supernal;
There is manna and an endless, glad hosanna.
Hallelujah! Let praises ring!
Unto our Triune God we sing;
Blest be His Name forever!
With angel hosts let us adore
And sing His praises more and more
For all His grace and favor!
Singing, ringing: Holy, holy, God is holy,
Spread the story of our God, the Lord of Glory!

Hallelujah, praise Jehovah,
O my soul, Jehovah praise;
I will sing the glorious praises
Of my God through all my days.
Put no confidence in princes,
Nor for help on man depend;
He shall die, to dust returning,
And his purposes shall end.
Happy is the man that chooses
Israel’s God to be his aid;
He is blest whose hope of blessing
On the Lord his God is stayed.
Heaven and earth the Lord created,
Seas and all that they contain;
He delivers from oppression,
Righteousness He will maintain.
Food He daily gives the hungry,
Sets the mourning prisoner free,
Raises those bowed down with anguish,
Makes the sightless eyes to see.
Well Jehovah loves the righteous,
And the stranger He befriends,
Helps the fatherless and the widow,
Judgment on the wicked sends.
Hallelujah, praise Jehovah,
O my soul, Jehovah praise;
I will sing the glorious praises
Of my God through all my days.
Over all God reigns forever,
Through all ages He is King;
Unto Him, thy God, O Zion,
Joyful hallelujahs sing.

Hallelujah, praise Jehovah, from the heavens praise His Name;
Praise Jehovah in the highest, all His angels, praise proclaim.
All His hosts, together praise Him, sun and moon and stars on high;
Praise Him, O you heav’ns of heavens, and you floods above the sky.
Let them praises give Jehovah, for His Name alone is high,
And His glory is exalted, and His glory is exalted,
And His glory is exalted far above the earth and sky.
Let them praises give Jehovah, they were made at His command;
Them forever He established, His decree shall ever stand,
From the earth, O praise Jehovah, all you seas, you monsters all,
Fire and hail and snow and vapors, stormy winds that hear His call.
All you fruitful trees and cedars, all you hills and mountains high,
Creeping things and beasts and cattle, birds that in the heavens fly,
Kings of earth, and all you people, princes great, earth’s judges all;
Praise His Name, young men and maidens, aged men, and children small.

Hallelujah! raise, O raise
To our God the song of praise;
All His servants join to sing
God our Savior and our King.
Blessed be forevermore
That dread Name which we adore;
Round the world His praise be sung
Through all lands, in every tongue.
O’er all nations God alone,
Higher than the heav’ns His throne;
Who is like to God most high,
Infinite in majesty!
Yet to view the heav’ns He bends;
Yea, to earth He condescends;
Passing by the rich and great,
For the low and desolate.
He can raise the poor to stand
With the princes of the land;
Wealth upon the needy shower;
Set him with the high in power.
He the broken spirit cheers:
Turns to joy the mourner’s tears;
Such the wonders of His ways;
Praise His Name, forever praise!

Hallelujah, He is risen!
Jesus is gone up on high!
Burst the bars of death asunder,
Angels shout and men reply:
He is risen, He is risen,
Living now no more to die.
He is risen, He is risen,
Living now no more to die.
Hallelujah, He is risen!
Our exalted Head to be;
Sends the witness of the Spirit
That our advocate is He:
He is risen, He is risen,
Justified in Him are we.
He is risen, He is risen,
Justified in Him are we.
Hallelujah, He is risen!
Death for aye hath lost his sting,
Christ, Himself the Resurrection,
From the grave His own will bring:
He is risen, He is risen,
Living Lord and coming King.
He is risen, He is risen,
Living Lord and coming King.

Hallelujah, Jesus is Lord
Hallelujah, death is no more
Hallelujah, hope is restored
Hallelujah, Jesus is Lord
He was dead in the grave
And all hope had vanished away
He arose; He’s alive
And I’m ready to shout it on high.
I was dead in my sins
Bound for hell and darkness within
By His love, I’m alive
Heaven’s gates are opened wide.
We’re alive in the Son
Longing for the day He will come
In a flash, trumpet blast
Christ the Victor will raise us at last!

’Tis the promise of God, full salvation to give
Unto him who on Jesus, His Son, will believe.
Hallelujah, ’tis done! I believe on the Son;
I am saved by the blood of the crucified One;
Hallelujah, ’tis done! I believe on the Son;
I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.
Though the pathway be lonely, and dangerous, too,
Surely Jesus is able to carry me through.
Many loved ones have I in yon heavenly throng,
They are safe now in glory, and this is their song:
Little children I see standing close by their King,
And He smiles as their song of salvation they sing:
There are prophets and kings in that throng I behold,
And they sing as they march through the streets of pure gold:
There’s a part in that for you and for me,
And the theme of our praises forever will be:

In the resurrection morning,
When the trump of God shall sound,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
Then the saints will come rejoicing
And no tears will e’er be found,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise.
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
Amen! We shall rise! Hallelujah!
In the resurrection morning,
When death’s prison bars are broken,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! We shall rise.
In the resurrection morning,
What a meeting it will be,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
When our fathers and our mothers,
And our loved ones we shall see,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
In the resurrection morning,
Blessed thought it is to me,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
I shall see my blessed Savior,
Who so freely died for me,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
In the resurrection morning,
We shall meet Him in the air,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
And be carried up to glory,
To our home so bright and fair,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!

Man of Sorrows! what a name
For the Son of God, Who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim.
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood.
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
Guilty, vile, and helpless we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
“Full atonement!" can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
Lifted up was He to die;
“It is finished!" was His cry;
Now in Heav’n exalted high.
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew His song we’ll sing:
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

My God, I have found the thrice-blessed ground,
Where life and where joy and true comfort abound.
Hallelujah! Thine the glory!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Thine the glory!
Revive us again.
'Tis found in the blood of Him who once stood
My refuge and safety, my Surety with God.
He bore on the tree the sentence for me,
And now both the Surety and sinner are free.
Accepted I am in the onceoffered Lamb,
It was was God who Himself had devised the plan.
And though here below 'mid sorrow and woe,
My place is in heaven with Jesus, I know.
And this I shall find, for such is His mind.
He'll not be in glory and leave me behind.

Your love is amazing, steady and unchanging
Your love is a mountain, firm beneath my feet
Your love is a mystery, how you gently lift me
When I am surrounded, your love carries me
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing
Your love is surprising, I can feel it rising
All the joy that's growing deep inside of me
Every time I see you, all your goodness shines through
And I can feel this God song, rising up in me
Album: Come, Now is the Time to Worship
25 Top Vineyard Worship Songs

Now begin the heavenly race—
The Savior calls today;
Let us early seek His face,
And early learn to pray.
Hand in hand we’ll journey on,
Reaching forward to the prize,
Hoping, trusting in the Lord,
Where all our vigor lies.
He Who left His Father’s throne,
To suffer, bleed and die,
He Who made our grief his own,
Will every want supply.
They who on His Name believe,
And patiently endure,
Life eternal shall receive,
And find His mercy sure.
Now begin the heavenly race,
No more, no more delay;
To the healing fount of grace,
Rejoicing, haste away.

Look out, little woman! Look out, little man!
Do be just as careful as ever you can,
For each of you carry a treasure too rare
To risk any trifling, so “Handle with care!" 
Look out! Look out, little woman!
Look out, little man! 
Your soul is the treasure, and day after day
You choose which to follow: the straight or broad way;
So mind what comes nigh you, and heed where you go—
Your soul is eternal for weal or for woe.
The words of the Savior were “Come unto Me!"
So sweetly He spoke them in dear Galilee;
He wants us to serve Him with pure hearts, and true;
Then let us be careful in all that we do.

Hands that have been handling,
holy things and high,
still, Lord, in thy service
bless and fortify.
Ears which heard the message
of the words of life,
keep thou closed and guarded
from the noise of strife.
Eyes whose contemplation
looked upon thy love,
let them gaze expectant
on the world above.
"Holy, holy, holy,"
thee our lips confessed:
on those lips for ever
let no falsehood rest.
Feet which trod the pavement
round about God's board,
let them walk in glory
where God's light is poured.
Bodies that have tasted
of the living Bread,
be they re-created
in their living Head.
Be we all one Body,
all our members one,
measured by the stature
of God's full-grown Son.

Happiness is to know the Savior
Living a life within His favor,
Having a change in my behavior
Happinesss is the Lord
Happiness is a new creation
Jesus in me in close relation
Having a part in His salvation
Happiness is the Lord
Real joy is mine
No matter if teardrops start,
I've found the secret --
It's Jesus in my heart!
Happiness is to be forgiven
Living the life that worth the living
Taking a trip that leads to heaven
Happiness is the Lord, Happiness is the Lord
Happiness is the Lord!

Sweetly I trust in my Redeemer as I go singing on my way
So happy am I (yes so happy now), yes happy am I (very happy now)
Ever I know that He is with me, keeping my soul from day to day
So happy am I (happy now am I), yes happy am I (yes happy am I)
Happy am I with my Redeemer
Singing along the homeward way
And telling the lost (tell-) of (-ing) His (all) great love (the lost of His 
great mercy)
Happy am I to know He's with me (I'm always happy)
Keeping me spotless day by day (yes day by day)
I'm happy along (yes) the way (I'm happy) to heaven above (along the way, along 
the journey)
Sweetly I sing along the journey helping the lost to know His love
So happy am I (yes so happy now), yes happy am I (very happy now)
Hoping to meet Him in the morning in that sweet happy home above
So happy am I (happy now am I), yes happy am I (yes happy am I)
Looking for Him most any moment, ready when Jesus shall appear
So happy am I (yes so happy now), yes happy am I (very happy now)
Keeping my lamp all trimmed and burning, feeling His coming now is near
So happy am I (happy now am I), yes happy am I (yes happy am I)

Happy are they, they that love God,
Whose hearts have Christ confessed,
Who by His cross have found their life,
And ’neath His yoke their rest.
Glad is the praise, sweet are the songs,
When they together sing;
And strong the prayers that bow the ear
Of Heaven’s eternal King.
Christ to their homes giveth His peace,
And makes their loves His own;
But ah, what tares the evil one
Hath in his garden sown.
Sad were our lot, evil this earth,
Did not its sorrows prove
The path whereby the sheep may find
The fold of Jesu’s love.
Then shall they know, they that love Him,
How all their pain is good;
And death itself cannot unbind
Their happy brotherhood.

The bells of Christmas chime once more;
The heavenly guest is at the door
He comes to earthly dwelling still
With new year gifts of peace, good will
This world though wide and far outspread,
Could scarcely find for you a bed
Your cradle was a manger stall
No pearl no silk no kingly hall
Now let us go with quiet mind,
The swaddled babe with shepherds find,
To gaze on him who gladdens them
The lovliest flow'r of Jesse's stem
O join with me, in gladness sing,
To keep our Christmas with our King,
Until our song, from loving souls,
Like rushing mighty water rolls!
O patriarchs' Joy, O prophets' Song
O Dayspring bright, awaited long
O son of Man, incarnate Word
Great David's Son, great David's Lord
Come, Jesus, glorious heav'nly guest,
And keep your Christmas in our breast
Then David's harpstrings, hushed so long,
Shall swell our jubilee of song.

I am happy in the Lord for the love He showed to me,
And I’m resting on His precious promise;
Confiding in His Word, He will keep me pure and free,
And forever in His grace victorious.
Happy in the Savior,
Happy in the Savior,
Happy in the Savior,
I am happy in the Lord.
I am happy in the Lord since my sins are washed away,
I’ve His peace within my heart abiding;
He sanctified my soul, and the Blesser came to stay,
In the bosom of His love I’m hiding.
I am happy in the Lord, for He gives me life and breath,
And He sweetens all my days with pleasure;
He’s all I need on earth; He’s my vict’ry over death,
He’s the secret of that hidden treasure.
I am happy in the Lord for the place prepared for me,
Oh, how sweet the blessed consolation;
And though I fall asleep, I shall wake eternally,
In His likeness with His great salvation.

Happy little pilgrims,
We should ne’er be sad;
For the love of Jesus
Makes His children glad.
Happy little pilgrims,
Going on our way,
To a land of beauty,
Singing all the day.
In that land so lovely,
Everything is bright,
There will be no sorrow,
There will be no night.
Not alone we journey
To the mansions fair;
Jesus is our Shepherd;
He will lead us there.

Happy soul, that, free from harms,
Rests within his Shepherd’s arms!
Who his quiet shall molest?
Who shall violate his rest?
Jesus doth his spirit bear;
Jesus takes his every care;
He Who found the wandering sheep,
Jesus, still delights to keep.
O that I might so believe,
Steadfastly to Jesus cleave;
On His only love rely,
Smile at the destroyer nigh;
Free from sin and servile fear,
Have my Jesus ever near;
All His care rejoice to prove,
All His paradise of love!
Jesus, seek Thy wandering sheep;
Bring me back, and lead, and keep;
Take on Thee my every care;
Bear me, on Thy bosom bear;
Let me know my Shepherd’s voice;
More and more in Thee rejoice;
More and more of Thee receive;
Ever in Thy spirit live.
Live, till all Thy life I know,
Perfect, through my Lord, below;
Gladly then from earth remove,
Gathered to the fold above;
O that I at last may stand,
With the sheep at Thy right hand;
Take the crown so freely given,
Enter in by Thee to Heaven.

We are happy sunbeams,
Shining day by day,
Making others happy as we go our way,
Bright’ning gloomy places,
Spreading mirth and cheer,
Always glowing brightly for our Savior dear.
We are happy sunbeams,
Shining day by day,
Making others happy all along the way.
We are happy sunbeams,
Shining in the gloom,
Love’s true light reflecting as we journey home;
Much of care and sadness
Daily we remove
With our looks of kindness and our smiles of love.
We are little sunbeams,
With bright gleam and glow,
We are helping others ev’rywhere we go;
Thus to our Redeemer
We will prove our love,
Till He bids us join Him in His home above.

Happy the home when God is there,
And love fills every breast;
When one their wish, and one their prayer,
And one their heav’nly rest.
Happy the home where Jesus’ Name
Is sweet to every ear;
Where children early speak His fame,
And parents hold Him dear.
Happy the home where prayer is heard,
And praise each day does rise;
Where parents love the sacred Word
And all its wisdom prize.
Lord, let us in our homes agree
This blessed peace to gain;
Unite our hearts in love to Thee,
And love to all will reign.

Happy the man that finds the grace,
The blessing of God's chosen race,
The wisdom coming from above,
The faith that sweetly works by love.
Happy beyond description he
Who knows 'The Saviour died for me',
The gift unspeakable obtains,
And heav'nly understanding gains.
Wisdom divine! Who tells the price
Of wisdom's costly merchandise?
Wisdom to silver we prefer,
And gold is dross compared to her.
Her hands are filled with length of days,
True riches, and immortal praise,
Riches of Christ, on all bestowed,
And honour that descends from God.
To purest joys she all invites,
Chaste, holy, spiritual delights;
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her flowery paths are peace.
Happy the man who wisdom gains,
Thrice happy who his guest retains;
He owns, and shall for ever own,
Wisdom, and Christ, and heaven are one.

Happy the man who feareth God,
Whose feet His holy ways have trod;
Thine own good hand shall nourish thee,
And well and happy shalt thou be.
Thy wife shall, like a fruitful vine,
Fill all thy house with clusters fine;
Thy children all be fresh and sound,
Like olive-plants thy table round.
Lo! to the man these blessings cleave
Who in God’s holy fear doth live;
From him the ancient curse hath fled
By Adam’s race inherited.
Out of Mount Zion God shall send,
And crown with joy thy latter end;
That thou Jerusalem mayst see,
In favor and prosperity.
He shall be with thee in thy ways,
And give thee health and length of days;
Yea, thou shalt children’s children see,
And peace on Israel shall be.

Happy the man whose cautious feet
Shun the broad way that sinners go,
Who hates the place where atheists meet,
And fears to talk as scoffers do.
He loves t’employ the morning light
Amongst the statutes of the Lord;
And spends the wakeful hours of night,
With pleasure, pond’ring o’er His Word.
He, like a plant by gentle streams,
Shall flourish in immortal green;
And Heav’n will shine with kindest beams
On ev’ry work his hands begin.
But sinners find their counsels cross’d:
As chaff before the tempest flies,
So shall their hopes be blown and lost,
When the last trumpet shakes the skies.
In vain the rebel seeks to stand
In judgment with the pious race;
The dreadful Judge, with stern command,
Divides him to a diff’rent place.
“Straight is the way My saints have trod;
I bless’d the path, and drew it plain;
But you would choose the crooked road,
And down it leads to endless pain."

Happy the souls to Jesus joined,
And saved by grace alone,
Walking in all His ways they find
Their heaven on earth begun.
The church triumphant in Thy love,
Their mighty joys we know;
They sing the Lamb in hymns above,
And we in hymns below.
Thee in Thy glorious realm they praise,
And bow before Thy throne,
We in the kingdom of Thy grace:
The kingdoms are but one.
The holy to the holiest leads,
From thence our spirits rise,
And he that in Thy statutes treads
Shall meet Thee in the skies.

Happy town of Salem, set on Zion’s hill!
Happy hearts of pilgrims, could they see it still!
He that follows Jesus, He that dares the right,
Sees the lights of Salem gleam across the night.
Happy town of Salem, with the jasper wall!
In its many mansions there is room for all.
“Come to Me," says Jesus, “I will give you rest,"
And the town of Salem gathers all the blest.
Happy town of Salem, happy little feet
Of the children playing in the golden street!
“Let them come," says Jesus, “and forbid them not";
But the proud in Salem have no part or lot.
Happy town of Salem, with its open gates!
Happy are the pilgrims whom a welcome waits!
In the Name of Jesus, they an entrance claim,
And the guards of Salem answer, “In His Name."
Happy town of Salem, vision true of peace,
Seen above earth’s strivings, steadfast when they cease!
“Take thy cross," says Jesus, and the narrow way
Brings the feet to Salem at the break of day.

You gotta walk right, talk right, sing right, pray right, on the battlefield

We keep bringin souls to Jesus
By the service that we give

We are hard pressed on every side
But not crushed 
Perplexed, but not in despair 
Persecuted but not abandoned
Struck down, but not destroyed
Persecuted but not abandoned
Struck down 
We are hard pressed on every side
But not crushed 
Perplexed, but not in despair 

Hark, creation's alleluia,
rising from a thousand shores,
vibrates sweet as angel voices,
loud as many waters, roars--
"Blessing, glory, power, salvation
to our God upon the throne,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
infinite, supreme, alone."
Gathering strength from every nation,
every kindred, tribe, and tongue,
hark, that everlasting anthem,
hark, that glorious tide of song,
floods the valleys with its music,
echoes from the lasting hills,
onward, upward, till the temple
of the living God it fills.
Hark, it mingles with the raptures
of the armies of the sky,
who have passed through tribulation
into perfect rest on high,
clothed in robes of spotless beauty,
palms of triumph in their hand,
harping on their harps hosannas,
as before his face they stand:
"Glory unto him who loved us,
him who washed us with his blood,
kings and priests henceforth for ever
to our Father and our God.
Alleluia! saints and angels,
raise your loudest, loftiest strains!
Alleluia! hell is vanquished;
God, the Lord Almighty, reigns.

Hark from on high those blissful strains!
Whence can such sweetness be?
Have angels waked their golden harps
With Heav’ns own minstrelsy?
With Heav’ns own minstrelsy?
Or do we hear the cherub voice
Of infant bands who raise,
Soaring from earth celestial notes
In their Creator’s praise?
In their Creator’s praise?
Thus spake the shepherds—yet with dread,
So strange the sounds they heard,
While o’er their slumb’ring flocks they kept
Their wonted nightly guard,
Their wonted nightly guard.
And soon they saw a dazzling light
Beam through the starry way,
And shining seraphs clust’ring where
The infant Jesus lay,
The infant Jesus lay.
They came a Savior’s birth to tell,
And tunes of rapture sing;
Hence the glad notes that filled the air—
Each swept his loudest string,
Each swept his loudest string.
But now in accents soft and kind
The chieftain angel said,
“Heav’ns tidings of great joy we bear—
Shepherds, be not afraid,
Shepherds, be not afraid."

Hark, how all the welkin rings,
"Glory to the King of kings;
peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
join the triumph of the skies;
universal nature say,
"Christ the Lord is born today!"
Christ, by highest Heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord:
late in time behold him come,
offspring of a Virgin's womb!
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see,
hail the incarnate Deity!
pleased as man with men to appear,
Jesus, our Emmanuel here!
Hail, the heavenly Prince of Peace,
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
risen with healing in his wings.
Mild he lays his glory by,
born that man no more may die;
born to raise the sons of earth;
born to give them second birth.
Come, Desire of nations, come,
fix in us thy humble home;
rise, the woman's conquering Seed,
bruise in us the serpent's head.
Now display thy saving power,
ruined nature now restore;
now in mystic union join
thine to ours, and ours to thine.
Adam's likeness, Lord, efface, 
Stamp thy image in its place.
Second Adam from above, 
Reinstate us in thy love.
Let us thee, though lost, regain, 
Thee, the life, the inner man: 
O, to all thyself impart, 
Formed in each believing heart.

Bells of praise! Bells of praise!
How the merry bells are ringing,
Joyous notes their message bringing!
Come where love and mercy meet,
Bells of praise ring clear and sweet.
Hark to the bells so sweetly blending;
Go with heart and voice attending;
Love and mercy meet you there,
In this hour of praise and prayer.
Bells of prayer! Bells of prayer!
Oh, how tenderly the pleading,
Weary, longing souls entreating,
Have a pardon full and free!
Bells of prayer entreating thee!
Bells of joy! Bells of joy!
Loud and clear the peals are telling
Of the songs of praises swelling.
Worship in yon temple hall;
Bells of joy proclaim the call.

Hark! The Church proclaims her honor,
And her strength is only this:
God hath laid His choice upon her,
And the work she doth is His.
He His Church hath firmly founded,
He will guard what He began;
We, by sin and foes surrounded,
Build her bulwarks as we can.
Frail and fleeting are our powers,
Short our days, our foresight dim,
And we own the choice not ours,
We were chosen first by Him.
Onward, then! For naught despairing,
Calm we follow at His word,
Thus through joy and sorrow bearing
Faithful witness to our Lord.
Though we here must strive in weakness,
Though in tears we often bend,
What His might began in meekness
Shall achieve a glorious end.

Hark! the song of jubilee,
Loud as mighty thunders roar,
Or the fullness of the sea
When it breaks upon the shore:
Hallelujah! for the Lord
God omnipotent shall reign;
Hallelujah! let the word
Echo round the earth and main.
Hallelujah! hark! the sound
From the depths unto the skies,
Wakes above, beneath, around,
All creation’s harmonies;
See Jehovah’s banner furled,
Sheathed His sword; He speaks; ’tis done!
And the kingdoms of this world
Are the kingdoms of His Son.
He shall reign from pole to pole
With illimitable sway;
He shall reign, when, like a scroll
Yonder heavens have passed away:
Then the end; beneath His rod
Man’s last enemy shall fall;
Hallelujah! Christ in God,
God in Christ, is all in all.

Hark! ’tis the Shepherd’s voice I hear
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who’ve gone astray
Far from the Shepherd’s fold away.
Bring them in, bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, bring them in,
Bring the wand’ring ones to Jesus.
Who’ll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wand’ring ones to find?
Who’ll bring the lost ones to the fold,
Where they’ll be sheltered from the cold?
Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountains wild and high;
Hark! ’tis the Master speaks to thee,
“Go find My sheep where’er they be."

Hark! ’tis the watchman’s cry,
“Wake, brethren, wake!"
Jesus our Lord is nigh;
Wake, brethren, wake!
Sleep is for sons of night;
Ye are children of the light,
Yours is the glory bright;
Wake, brethren, wake!
Call to each waking band,
“Watch, brethren, watch!"
Clear is our Lord’s command;
Watch, brethren, watch!
Be ye as men that wait
Always at the Master’s gate,
E’en though He tarry late;
Watch, brethren, watch!
Heed we the steward’s call,
“Work, brethren, work!"
There’s room enough for all;
Work, brethren, work!
This vineyard of the Lord
Constant labor will afford;
Yours is a sure reward;
Work, brethren, work!
Hear we the Shepherd’s voice,
“Pray, brethren, pray!"
Would ye His heart rejoice?
Pray, brethren, pray!
Sin calls for constant fear,
Weakness needs the Strong One near
Long as ye struggle here;
Pray, brethren, pray!
Now sound the final chord,
“Praise, brethren, praise!"
Thrice holy is our Lord;
Praise, brethren, praise!
What more befits the tongues
Soon to lead the angels’ songs,
While Heav’n the note prolongs,
Praise, brethren, praise.

Hark! a thrilling voice is sounding;
“Christ is nigh," it seems to say,
“Cast away the works of darkness,
O ye children of the day."
Wakened by the solemn warning
Let the earthbound soul arise;
Christ, her Sun, all ill dispelling,
Shines upon the morning skies.
Lo, the Lamb, so long expected,
Comes with pardon down from Heav’n;
Let us haste, with tears of sorrow,
One and all to be forgiven.
That when next He comes in glory,
And the world is wrapped in fear,
With His mercy He may shield us,
And with words of love draw near.
Honor, glory, might, and blessing
Be to God: the Father, Son
And the everlasting Spirit,
While eternal ages run.

Hark! A voice divides the sky, happy are the faithful dead!
In the Lord who sweetly die, they from all their toils are freed;
Them the Spirit hath declared blessed, unutterably blessed;
Jesus is their great reward, Jesus is their endless rest.
Followed by their works, they go where their Head has gone before;
Reconciled by grace below, grace has opened mercy’s door;
Justified through faith alone, here they knew their sins forgiven,
Here they laid their burden down, hallowed, and made fit for heaven.
Who can now lament the lot of a saint in Christ deceased?
Let the world, who know us not, call us hopeless and unblessed:
When from flesh the spirit freed hastens homeward to return,
Mortals cry, “A man is dead!" Angels sing, “A child is born!"
Born into the world above, they our happy brother greet,
Bear him to the throne of love, place him at the Savior’s feet;
Jesus smiles, and says, “Well done, good and faithful servant thou;
Enter, and receive thy crown, reign with Me triumphant now."
Angels catch the approving sound, bow, and bless the just award;
Hail the heir with glory crowned, now rejoicing with his Lord:
Fuller joys ordained to know, waiting for the general doom,
When the archangel’s trump shall blow, “Rise, ye dead, to judgment come!"

Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound;
My ears, attend the cry;
“Ye living men, come view the ground
Where you must shortly lie.
“Princes, this clay must be your bed,
In spite of all your towers;
The tall, the wise, the rev’rend head
Must lie as low as ours!"
Great God! is this our certain doom?
And are we still secure?
Still walking downward to our tomb,
And yet prepare no more?
Grant us the powers of quick’ning grace,
To fit our souls to fly,
Then, when we drop this dying flesh,
We’ll rise above the sky.

Hark, hark the song, gliding along,
Borne on the summer breeze, far, far away;
Dear Sabbath home, once more we come,
Hailing with glad delight this happy day;
Eyes beaming brightly, hearts bounding lightly,
Now we sing our merry, merry lay.
Dear Sabbath home, once more we come,
Hailing with glad delight this happy day.
Green shady bowers, sweet blushing flowers,
Come with the summer time, blooming anew;
Morn’s gentle ray, golden and gay,
Shines on the lily-bells sparkling with dew;
Beauty is calling, music is falling,
Now again earth wakes her joyful lay.
Hark, hark the song, floating along,
Borne to the sunny land fadeless and fair;
Savior and King, gladly we bring
Praise for Thy precious love, Thy tender care;
Gathered before Thee, young hearts adore Thee,
Savior, hear, O hear our happy lay.

Hark! hark!—the notes of joy
Roll o’er the heavenly plains,
And seraphs find employ
For their sublimest strains;
Some new delight in heaven is known,
Loud sound the harps around the throne.
Hark! hark!—the sounds draw nigh,
The joyful hosts descend;
Jesus forsakes the sky,
To earth His footsteps bend;
He comes to bless our fallen race;
He comes with messages of grace.
Bear, bear the tidings round;
Let every mortal know
What love in God is found,
What pity He can show;
Ye winds that blow! ye waves that roll!
Bear the glad news from pole to pole.
Strike, strike the harps again,
To great Immanuel’s Name;
Arise, ye sons of men!
And all His grace proclaim;
Angels and men! wake every string
’Tis God the Savior’s praise we sing.

Hark, hark, my soul! the Savior’s voice is calling,
E’en now it breathes o’er life’s dark troubled sea;
His gracious truth like heav’nly dew is falling;
Hark, hark, my soul! thy Father calls for thee!
Father of mercy, Father of love!
Thee would we follow to our blest home above.
Hark, hark, my soul! from Heav’n that voice is pleading
With thee, ere evil days draw darkly near;
Still by His Word our Father’s hand is leading,
From sin and shame, from sorrow, doubt and fear.
Father of mercy, Father of love!
Thee would we follow to our blest home above.
Hark, hark, my soul! still, still that voice is sounding
Like music sweet, from some far distant shore,
While angel bands, our daily path surrounding,
Lead God’s dear children on forevermore.
Father of mercy, Father of love!
Thee would we follow to our blest home above.

Hark! hark, my soul! angelic songs are swelling,
O’er earth’s green fields and ocean’s wave-beat shore:
How sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling
Of that new life when sin shall be no more.
Angels of Jesus, angels of light,
Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!
Darker than night life’s shadows fall around us,
And like benighted men we miss our mark:
God hides Himself, and grace hath scarcely found us,
E’er death finds out his victims in the dark.
Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,
The voice of Jesus sounds o’er land and sea;
And laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,
Kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee.
Onward we go, for still we hear them singing,
“Come, weary souls, for Jesus bids you come";
And through the dark, its echoes sweetly ringing,
The music of the Gospel leads us home.
Rest comes at length: though life be long and dreary,
The day must dawn, and darksome night be past;
Faith’s journeys end in welcome to the weary,
And Heaven, the heart’s true home, will come at last.
Cheer up, my soul! faith’s moonbeams softly glisten
Upon the breast of life’s most troubled sea,
And it will cheer thy drooping heart to listen
To those brave songs which angels mean for thee.
Angels, sing on, your faithful watches keeping;
Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above,
Till morning’s joy shall end the night of weeping,
And life’s long shadows break in cloudless love.

Hark! how time’s wide sounding bell
Strikes on each attentive ear!
Tolling loud the solemn knell
Of the late departed year:
Years, like mortals, wear away,
Have their birth, and dying day;
Youthful spring, and wintry age,
Then to others quit the stage.
Sad experience may relate
What a year the last has been!
Crops of sorrow have been great,
From the fruitful seeds of sin:
O! what numbers gay and blithe,
Fell by death’s unsparing scythe?
While they thought the world their own,
Suddenly he mowed them down.
See how war, with dreadful stride,
Marches at the Lord’s command,
Spreading desolation wide,
Through a once much-favored land:
War, with heart and arms of steel,
Preys on thousands at a meal;
Daily drinking human gore,
Still he thirsts, and calls for more.
If the God, Whom we provoke,
Hither should His way direct;
What a sin-avenging stroke
May a land, like this, expect!
They who now securely sleep,
Quickly then, would wake and weep;
And too late would learn to fear,
When they saw the danger near.
You are safe, who know His love,
He will all His truth perform;
To your souls a refuge prove
From the rage of every storm:
But we tremble for the youth;
Teach them, Lord, Thy saving truth;
Join them to Thy faithful few,
Be to them a Refuge too.

Hark! I hear a sound from o’er the water,
’Tis the cry of anguish and despair;
’Tis the cry of precious souls in darkness,
While waiting for the light of Jesus, there;
Hear the idle laborers near us saying,
“Master what wilt Thou have me to do?"
The harvest now is great, oh! haste, my brother,
The reapers few.
Who will go? Who will go?
To the ends of the earth,
Hast thou a passion for the lost?
Dost thou realize what a soul is worth?
Who will go? Who will go?
Tell of Jesus’ death upon the tree?
Oh! who will answer quickly,
“Here am I, O Lord, send me"?
Will you go and tell them of a Savior?
Tell them how He suffered on the tree?
Will you give your very life to save them?
And tell them Jesus came to set them free?
Will you take the way, endure the suffering?
Finding in the cross your only rest?
For suffering here with Jesus brings the glory,
His ways are best.
We will follow, we will follow Jesus,
Willingly and gladly we’ll obey,
He will never leave us nor forsake us,
He is our Friend, our Comforter and Stay.
Though He lead us o’er the briny ocean,
Though He lead us o’er the sandy plain,
We still will trust in Jesus Christ our Savior,
Oh! praise His Name.
After we’ve received the Spirit’s fullness,
Filling all our hearts with love divine,
We’re to witness to the blessed Gospel,
In every nation, country, land and clime,
When we give the Gospel as a witness
Unto every people far and near,
With lightning flash, we’ll see in clouds of glory
The King appear.

Hark! the skies with music sound,
Heav’nly glory beams around;
Christ is born! the angels sing
Glory to the newborn King.
Peace is come, goodwill appears;
Sinners wipe away your tears;
Christ for you in flesh today
Humbly in the manger lay.
Shepherds, tending flocks by night,
Heard the song, and saw the light;
Took their reeds, and softest strains
Echoed through the happy plains.
Mortals, hail the glorious King!
Richest incense cheerful bring;
Praise and love Immanuel’s Name,
And His boundless grace proclaim.
Glory, praise, and blessing be,
Lord, our Savior, unto Thee;
Thee let heaven and earth adore,
God o’er all forevermore.

Hark! the sound of holy voices, chanting at the crystal sea,
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Lord, to Thee;
Multitude, which none can number, like the stars in glory stand
Clothed in white apparel, holding palms of victory in their hand.
Patriarch, and holy prophet, who prepared the way of Christ
King, apostle, saint, confessor, martyr and evangelist;
Saintly maiden, godly matron, widows who have watched to prayer
Joined in holy concert, singing to the Lord of all, are there.
They have come from tribulation, and have washed their robes in blood,
Washed them in the blood of Jesus; tried they were, and firm they stood;
Mocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented, sawn asunder, slain with sword;
They have conquered death and Satan by the might of Christ the Lord.
Marching with Thy cross their banner, they have triumphed, following
Thee, the Captain of salvation, Thee, their Savior and their King;
Gladly, Lord, with Thee they suffered; gladly, Lord, with Thee they died;
And by death to life immortal they were born and glorified.
Now they reign in heav’nly glory, now they walk in golden light,
Now they drink, as from a river, holy bliss and infinite:
Love and peace they taste forever, and all truth and knowledge see
In the beatific vision of the blessed Trinity.
God of God, the One begotten, Light of light, Emmanuel,
In Whose body joined together all the saints forever dwell;
Pour upon us of Thy fullness that we may forevermore
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost adore.

Hark to the music resounding,
Reapers are needed today;
Fields are all white, to the harvest
Let us be up and away!
Ever the Master is calling,
Hasten! the shadows are falling;
On to the harvest field,
Gather the golden yield,
Precious sheaves.
Hark! hark! comes the song,
On! on! join the throng;
Forth with joyful, loving heart,
Bravely do your part;
Hark! hark! rings the call;
Haste! haste! one and all;
On where the harvest stands,
Waiting for willing hands
Souls to win.
Forward with hearts full of gladness,
Reapers, I pray you, make haste;
Grain there is ready and waiting,
If not soon gathered, will waste;
Then let us hear you replying,
Labor with courage undying,
Send up a word of cheer,
Tell of the rest so near,
Rest at home.
Hark to the song they are singing!
See, they have treasures so rare;
Soon will the harvest be ended,
Haste, then, their trophies to share.
Let no one be idly dreaming,
Look! look! the harvest is gleaming,
Join ye the reaping band,
Lend them a helping hand,
Ere the night.

Hark, what a sound, and too divine for hearing,
Stirs on the earth and trembles in the air!
Is it the thunder of the Lord’s appearing?
Is it the music of His people’s prayer?
Surely He cometh, and a thousand voices
Shout to the saints and to the deaf and dumb;
Surely He cometh, and the earth rejoices,
Glad in His coming Who hath sworn, “I come."
So even I, and with a pang more thrilling,
So even I, and with a hope more sweet,
Yearn for the sign, O Christ, of Thy fulfilling,
Faint for the flaming of Thine advent feet.
Yea, through life, death, through sorrow and through sinning,
He shall suffice me, for He hath sufficed;
Christ is the end, for Christ was the beginning,
Christ the beginning, for the end is Christ.

Hark! what mean those holy voices,
Sweetly sounding through the skies?
Lo! the angelic host rejoices
Heavenly hallelujahs rise.
Listen to the wondrous story,
Which they chant in hymns of joy;
“Glory in the highest, glory;
Glory be to God most high!
“Peace on earth, good will from heaven,
Reaching far as man is found;
Souls redeemed, and sins forgiven;
Loud our golden harps shall sound.
“Christ is born, the great Anointed;
Heaven and earth His praises sing:
O receive whom God appointed,
For your Prophet, Priest and King.
“Hasten, mortals to adore Him;
Learn His Name and taste His joy;
Till in heaven you sing before Him,
Glory be to God most high!"
Let us learn the wondrous story
Of our great Redeemer’s birth;
Spread the brightness of His glory
Till it cover all the earth.

Hark, how the watchmen cry,
Attend the trumpet’s sound!
Stand to your arms, the foe is nigh,
The powers of hell surround:
Who bow to Christ’s command,
Your arms and hearts prepare!
The day of battle is at hand!
Go forth to glorious war!
See on the mountain-top
The standard of your God!
In Jesus’ Name I lift it up,
All stained with hallowed blood.
His standard-bearer, I
To all the nations call,
Let all to Jesus’ cross draw nigh!
He bore the cross for all.
Go up with Christ your Head,
Your Captain’s footsteps see;
Follow your Captain, and be led
To certain victory.
All power to Him is giv’n,
He ever reigns the same;
Salvation, happiness, and Heav’n
Are all in Jesus’ Name.
Only have faith in God;
In faith your foes assail,
Not wrestling against flesh and blood,
But all the powers of hell;
From thrones of glory driv’n,
By flaming vengeance hurled,
They throng the air, and darken Heav’n,
And rule the lower world.

Hark, my soul, how everything
Strives to serve our bounteous King;
Each a double tribute pays,
Sings its parts, and then obeys.
Nature’s chief and sweetest choir
Him with cheerful notes admire;
Chanting every day their lauds,
While the grove their song applauds.
Though their voices lower be,
Streams have too their melody;
Night and day they warbling run,
Never pause, but still sing on.
All the flowers that gild the spring
Hither their still music bring;
If heaven bless them, thankful, they
Smell more sweet, and look more gay.
Only we can scarce afford
This short office to our Lord;
We, on whom His bounty flows,
All things gives, and nothing owes.
Wake! for shame, my sluggish heart,
Wake! and gladly sing thy part;
Learn of birds, and springs, and flowers,
How to use thy nobler powers.
Call whole nature to thy aid;
Since ’twas He whole nature made;
Join in one eternal song,
Who to one God all belong.
Live forever, glorious Lord!
Live by all Thy works adored,
One in Three, and Three in One,
Thrice we bow to Thee alone.

Hark, my soul, it is the Lord!
’Tis thy Savior, hear His Word;
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee,
“Say, poor, sinner, lovest thou Me?"
“I delivered thee when bound,
And, when bleeding, healed thy wound;
Sought thee wandering, set thee right,
Turned thy darkness into light.
“Can a woman’s tender care
Cease toward the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will I remember thee.
“Mine is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above,
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.
“Thou shalt see My glory soon,
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of My throne shalt be:
Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me?"
Lord, it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet I love Thee, and adore:
O for grace to love Thee more!

Hark, ten thousand harps and voices
Sound the note of praise above!
Jesus reigns, and Heav’n rejoices,
Jesus reigns, the God of love;
See, He sits on yonder throne;
Jesus rules the world alone.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Jesus, hail! Whose glory brightens
All above, and gives it worth;
Lord of life, Thy smile enlightens,
Cheers, and charms Thy saints on earth;
When we think of love like Thine,
Lord, we own it love divine.
Come, ye saints, unite your praises
With the angels round His throne;
Soon, we hope, our God will raise us
To the place where He is gone.
Meet it is that we should sing,
Glory, glory, to our King!
Sing how Jesus came from heaven,
How He bore the cross below,
How all power to Him is given,
How He reigns in glory now.
’Tis a great and endless theme
O, ’tis sweet to sing of Him.
King of glory, reign forever!
Thine an everlasting crown.
Nothing from Thy love shall sever
Those whom Thou hast made Thine own:
Happy objects of Thy grace,
Destined to behold Thy face.
Savior, hasten Thine appearing;
Bring, O bring the glorious day,
When, the awful summons bearing,
Heaven and earth shall pass away;
Then with golden harps we’ll sing,
“Glory, glory to our King!"

Hark! ten thousand voices sounding,
Far and wide throughout the sky;
’Tis the voice of joy abounding,
Jesus lives no more to die.
Jesus lives, His conflict over,
Lives to claim His great reward;
Angels round the Victor hover,
Crowding to behold their Lord.
Yonder throne for Him erected
Now becomes the Victor’s seat;
Lo, the Man on earth rejected,
Angels worship at His feet!
All the powers of Heav’n adore Him,
All obey His sovereign Word;
Day and night they cry before Him,
“Holy, Holy, Holy Lord!"

Hark! ten thousand voices crying,
“Lamb of God!" with one accord;
Thousand thousand saints replying,
Wake at once the echoing chord.
“Praise the Lamb," the waking,
All in heaven together throng;
Loud and far each tongue partaking
Rolls around the endless song.
Grateful incense this, ascending
Ever to the Father’s throne:
Every knee to Jesus bending,
All in mind in heaven is one.
All the Father’s counsels claiming
Equal honors to the Son,
All the Son’s effulgence beaming,
Makes the Father’s glory known.
By the Spirit all pervading,
Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,
Crowned with light and joy unfading,
Hail Him as the great “I AM."
Joyful now the new creation
Rests in undisturbed repose,
Blest in Jesus’ full salvation,
Sorrow now nor thralldom knows.
Hark! the heavenly notes again!
Loudly swells the song of praise;
Through creation’s vault, Amen!
Amen! responsive joy doth raise.

Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes,
The Savior promised long;
Let every heart prepare a throne,
And every voice a song.
On Him the Spirit, largely poured,
Exerts His sacred fire;
Wisdom and might, and zeal and love,
His holy breast inspire.
He comes the prisoners to release,
In Satan’s bondage held;
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.
He comes, from thickest films of vice
To clear the mental ray,
And on the eyes oppressed with night
To pour celestial day.
He comes the broken heart to bind,
The bleeding soul to cure;
And with the treasures of His grace
To enrich the humble poor.
His silver trumpets publish loud
The jub’lee of the Lord
Our debts are all remitted now
Our heritage restored.
Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
Thy welcome shall proclaim;
And Heav’n’s eternal arches ring
With Thy beloved Name.

Hark! The herald angels sing,
“Glory to the newborn King;
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th’angelic host proclaim,
“Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
Hark! the herald angels sing,
“Glory to the newborn King!"
Christ, by highest Heav’n adored;
Christ the everlasting Lord;
Late in time, behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin’s womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail th’incarnate Deity,
Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
Jesus our Emmanuel.
Hail the heav’nly Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris’n with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die.
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Come, Desire of nations, come,
Fix in us Thy humble home;
Rise, the woman’s conqu’ring Seed,
Bruise in us the serpent’s head.
Now display Thy saving power,
Ruined nature now restore;
Now in mystic union join
Thine to ours, and ours to Thine.
Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface,
Stamp Thine image in its place:
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love.
Let us Thee, though lost, regain,
Thee, the Life, the inner man:
O, to all Thyself impart,
Formed in each believing heart.

Hark, the sounds melodious stealing
Thro’ the quiet midnight air;
Sweet, seraphic music pealing
Over all the landscape fair.
Angel hosts of brightest glory,
Hover o’er a lowly bed—
Bed of Him foretold in story,
Son of Man, creation’s Head.
Singing, Glory to God,
Glory to God,
Glory to God in the highest,
Singing, Glory to God,
Glory to God,
Glory to God in the highest,
Wise men traveled till they found Him,
Found a King in Bethlehem!
King, with sheep and cattle ’round Him?
King, without a diadem?
Yes! the Prince of Peace eternal,
King of kings, of lords the Lord!
Hark! the swelling choirs supernal
As they join with one accord:
Let us lift our hearts and voices
Prince Immanuel’s praise to sing;
While the heav’nly host rejoices,
Let us, too, our tribute bring.
Heav’nward, now, His star is pointing,
Where He sits at God’s right hand,
Unto each His crown appointing,
Who before His throne shall stand.

Hark! the sounds of singing
Coming on the breeze,
Notes of triumph winging
Over lands and seas.
Martial hosts assemble,
Flushed with victory,
Hell’s battalions tremble
And prepare to flee.
Army of salvation!
Army of the Lord!
Christ our Inspiration
Christ our great Reward.
Whence have come these legions,
Valiant, free and strong?
Worldwide are the regions
Where they combat wrong.
Gathering ’neath our banner
While the trumpets blend,
Here in fervent manner
Let our praise ascend.
Plucked as brands from burning,
Saved by Jesus’ might,
Earth’s allurement spurning,
We for Christ will fight.
He Who found and freed us
From our captive chain,
Surely He will lead us
To eternal gain.
Wondrous, wondrous story
Of our God-made host,
Unto Jesus glory
’Tis in Him we boast.
Out of every nation,
By His might restored,
Army of salvation,
Army of the Lord.

Hark! the springtide breezes pass the news along,
Jesus Christ has risen, fill the world with song;
Earth and all her voices sing glad hosannas to the King,
Praises to our Lord we bring, Hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah! Praise the victor King,
Who to all His people life and light doth bring,
Glory, hallelujah! Praise the victor King,
Who to all His people life and light doth bring.
Finished is the conflict, all the battles o’er,
Peace that passeth knowledge comes to us once more,
Raise your notes of triumph high, Jesus lives no more to die,
Earth and Heav’n with joy reply, Hallelujah!
Golden gates are lifted, doors stand open wide,
Lo! the King is standing at His Father’s side,
In the land of endless light angels praise Him, day and night,
Crown Him ever Lord of might, Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Hark, the sound of coming legions,
O how joyful is the sound,
’Tis the children’s army marching,
On the Master’s errands bound.
See their faces all are glowing
With the joyous light of youth
As they’re marching, onward marching
For the cause of Right and Truth.
Hark, the tramp of coming legions,
O how joyful is the sound,
’Tis the children’s army marching,
On the Master’s errands bound.
Hark, the tramp of coming legions,
Hosts of Satan now must quail,
They must scatter in confusion
When this army shall prevail.
At the summons of the Master,
See the children fall in line,
Marching on with glad endeavor,
Trusting in the help divine.
Hark, the tramp of coming legions,
Marching onward millions strong,
They shall surely be victorious
O’er the hosts of sin and wrong.
Ever loyal to the Master,
Strong their hearts shall be and brave,
Till the Gospel’s glorious banner
Over all the world shall wave.

Hark! the vesper hymn is stealing
O’er the waters soft and clear;
Nearer yet and nearer pealing
Soft it breaks upon the ear,
Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
Farther now and farther stealing
Soft it fades upon the ear.
Now like moonlight waves retreating
To the shore it dies along;
Now like angry surges meeting
Breaks the mingled tide of song.
Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
Hark! again like waves retreating
To the shore it dies along.
Once again sweet voices ringing
Louder still the music swells;
While on summer breezes winging
Comes the chime of vesper bells.
Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
On the summer breezes winging
Fades the chime of vesper bells.

Hark! the voice eternal, robed in majesty,
Caging into being earth and sea and sky
Hark! in countless numbers all the angel throng
Hail creation's morning with one burst of song.
High in regal glory, 'mid eternal light,
Reign, O King immortal, holy, infinite.
Bright the world and glorious, calm both earth and sea,
Noble in its grandeur stood man's purity;
Came the great transgression, came the saddening fall,
Death and desolation breathing over all.
Still in regal glory, 'mid eternal light,
Reigned the King immortal, holy, infinite.
Long the nations waited, through the troubled night,
Looking, longing, yearning, for the promised light.
Prophets saw the morning breaking far away,
Minstrels sang the splendor of that opening day;
Whilst in regal glory, 'mid eternal light,
Reigned the King immortal, holy, infinite.
Brightly dawned the advent of the newborn King,
Joyously the watchers heard the angels sing.
Sadly closed the evening of His hallowed life,
As the noontide darkness veiled the last dread strife
Lo! again in glory, 'mid eternal light,
Reigns the King immortal, holy, infinite.
Lo! again He cometh, robed in clouds of fight,
As the Judge eternal, armed with power and might.
Nations to His footstool gathered then shall be;
Earth shall yield her treasures, and her dead, the sea.
Till the trumpet soundeth, 'mid eternal light
Reign, thou King immortal, holy, infinite.
Jesus! Lord and Master, Prophet, Priest, and King,
To thy feet, triumphant, hallowed praise we bring.
Thine the pain and weeping, Thine the victory;
Power, and praise, and honor, be, O Lord, to Thee.
High in regal glory, 'mid eternal light,
Reign, O King immortal, holy, infinite.

Hark, the voice of Jesus calling,
“Who will go and work today?
Fields are ripe and harvests waiting,
Who will bear the sheaves away?"
Long and loud the Master calls us,
Rich reward He offers free;
Who will answer, gladly saying,
“Here am I, send me, send me"?
If you cannot cross the ocean,
And the distant lands explore,
You can find the lost around you,
You can help them at your door;
If you cannot give your thousands,
You can give the widow’s mite;
What you truly give for Jesus,
Will be precious in His sight.
If you cannot speak like angels,
If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
You can say He died for all.
If you cannot rouse the wicked,
With the judgment’s dread alarms,
You can lead the little children
To the Savior’s waiting arms.
If you cannot be the watchman,
Standing high on Zion’s wall,
Pointing out the path to heaven,
Offering life and peace to all,
With your prayers and with your bounties
You can do what heaven demands;
You can be like faithful Aaron,
Holding up the prophet’s hands.
If among the older people,
You may not be apt to teach,
“Feed My lambs," said Christ, our Shepherd,
“Place the food within their reach."
And it may be that the children
You have led with trembling hand,
Will be found among your jewels,
When you reach the better land.
Let none hear you idly saying,
“There is nothing I can do."
While the lost of earth are dying,
And the Master calls for you;
Take the task He gives you gladly;
Let His work your pleasure be;
Answer quickly when He calls you,
“Here am I, send me, send me."

Hark! the voice of love and mercy
Sounds aloud from Calvary;
See, it rends the rocks asunder,
Shakes the earth, and veils the sky:
的t is finished!" 的t is finished!"
的t is finished!" Hear the dying Savior cry;
Hear the dying Savior cry.
的t is finished!" O what pleasure
Do these precious words afford;
Heav'nly blessings, without measure,
Flow to us from Christ the Lord:
的t is finished!" 的t is finished!"
的t is finished!" Saints the dying words record;
Saints the dying words record.
Finished all the types and shadows
Of the ceremonial law;
Finished all that God had promised;
Death and hell no more shall awe:
的t is finished!" 的t is finished!"
的t is finished!" Saints, from hence your comfort draw;
Saints, from hence your comfort draw.
Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs,
Join to sing the glorious theme;
All in earth, and all in heaven,
Join to praise Emmanuel's Name;
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Glory to the bleeding Lamb!
Glory to the bleeding Lamb!

Hark! there comes a whisper
Stealing on thine ear:
’Tis the Savior calling,
Soft, soft and clear.
“Give thy heart to Me,
Once I died for thee";
Hark! Hark! thy Savior calls:
Come, sinner, come!
With that voice so gentle,
Dost thou hear Him say?
“Tell Me all thy sorrows;
Come, come away!"
Wouldst thou find a refuge
For thy soul oppressed?
Jesus kindly answers,
“I am thy Rest."
At the cross of Jesus,
Let thy burden fall;
While He gently whispers,
“I’ll bear it all."

Hark! ’tis the holy temple’s bell;
The voice that summons me to prayer:
My heart, each roving fancy quell;
Come, to the house of God repair.
There, while, in orison sublime,
Souls to the throne of God ascend,
Let no unhallowed child of time
Profane pollutions with them blend.
How for thy wants canst thou implore,
Crave for thy frailties pardon free,
Of praise the votive tribute pour,
Or bend, in thanks, the grateful knee,
If, from the awful King of kings,
Each bauble lures thy soul astray;
If to this dust of earth it clings,
And, fickle, flies from heaven away;
Pure as the blessed seraph’s vow,
O, let the sacred concert rise;
Intent with humble rapture bow,
Adore the Ruler of the skies.
Bid earthborn atoms all depart;
Within thyself collected, fall;
And give one day, rebellious heart,
Unsullied to the Lord of all!

Hark! the gospel news is sounding,
Christ has suffered on the tree;
Streams of mercy are abounding,
Grace for all is rich and free.
Now poor sinner, Now poor sinner,
Come to Him who died for thee.
O escape to yonder mountain!
Refuge find in Him today;
Christ invites you to the fountain,
Come and wash your sins away.
Do not tarry, Do not tarry,
Come to Jesus while you may.
Grace is flowing like a river,
Millions there have been supplied;
Still it flows as fresh as ever
From the Saviour's wounded side.
None need perish, None need perish,
All may live for Christ hath died.
Christ alone shall be our portion;
When we soon shall meet above,
Bathing in the boundless ocean
Of the great Redeemer's love;
All His fulness, All His fulness
We shall then forever prove.

O Christian! do not falter,
The harvest field is white,
And many souls are sinking
Into eternal night.
The harvest bells are ringing,
We hear them night and day;
The harvest bells are pealing,
Go work, and watch, and pray;
The harvest bells are pealing,
Go work, watch, pray.
O reapers! quickly gather
The precious golden sheaves,
That day and night are falling
Like autumn’s withered leaves.
So few we find the lab’rers,
The harvest, oh, how great!
Then slumber not, dear Christian,
For soon ’twill be too late.

The harvest fields are bending
With precious ripened grain;
More reapers now are needed,
Ere Christ comes back again.
Harvest time! Harvest time!
Precious Gospel seed is sown.
Reapers go! Reapers go!
Jesus, King, must have His own, His loved ones;
Soon He’ll come! Soon He’ll come!
Come and catch away His Bride, His own!
His own! His own!
The call must now be heeded,
We cannot say Him nay;
Since He has died to save them,
We must go forth today.
We’ll come again rejoicing,
A reaper’s crown to gain;
The Harvest Home is coming,
When Christ comes back again.

Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard,
That firm remains on high
The everlasting throne of him
Who formed the sea and sky?
Art thou afraid his power shall fail
When comes thy evil day?
And can an all-creating arm
Grow weary or decay?
Supreme in wisdom as in power
The Rock of Ages stands;
Though him thou canst not see, nor trace
The working of his hands.
He gives the conquest to the weak,
Supports the fainting heart;
And courage in the evil hour
His heavenly aids impart.
Mere human power shall fast decay,
And youthful vigour cease;
But they who wait upon the Lord
In strength shall still increase.

Haste, traveler, haste! the night comes on,
And many a shining hour is gone;
The storm is gathering in the west,
And thou art from home and rest.
O far from home thy footsteps stray;
Christ is the life, and Christ the way,
And Christ the light; thy setting sun
Sinks ere thy morning is begun.
Awake, awake! pursue thy way
With steady course, while yet ’tis day;
While thou art sleeping on the ground,
Danger and darkness gather round.
The rising tempest sweeps the sky;
The rains descend, the winds are high;
The waters swell, and death and fear
Beset thy path, nor refuge near.
O yes! a shelter you may gain,
A covert from the wind and the rain,
A hiding-place a rest, a home,
A refuge from the wrath to come.
Then linger not in all the plain,
Flee for thy life, the mountain gain;
Look not behind, make no delay,
O speed thee, speed thee on thy way!
Poor, lost, benighted soul! art thou
Wiling to find salvation now?
There yet is hope; hear mercy’s call:
Truth! Life! Light! Way! in Christ is all!

Hasten the time appointed,
By prophets long foretold
When all shall dwell together,
One Shepherd and one fold.
Let every idol perish,
To moles and bats be thrown
And every prayer be offered
To God in Christ alone.
Let Jew and Gentile, meeting
From many a distant shore
Around one altar kneeling,
One common Lord adore.
Let all that now divides us
Remove and pass away,
Like shadows of the morning
Before the blaze of day.
Let all that now unites us
More sweet and lasting prove
A closer bond of union,
In a blest land of love.
Let war be learned no longer,
Let strife and tumult cease,
All earth His blessed kingdom
The Lord and Prince of Peace.
O long expected dawning,
Come with thy cheering ray!
When shall the morning brighten,
The shadows flee away?
O sweet anticipation!
It cheers the watchers on
To pray, and hope, and labor,
Till the dark night be gone.

There’s a heaven to gain,
There is torment to shun,
There are dangers in life to be braved;
There’s a foe to be fought,
And a prize to be won,
There are souls to be lost or be saved.
Hasten today,
Will you longer delay,
While the Master, so loving and true,
Is bidding you go,
And someone in woe
Is longing and waiting for you? 
Go and labor today,
And no longer refuse;
Hear the call from the lips of your Lord;
Brother, sister, awake!
There is no time to lose,
For the millions now wait for His word.
Brother, hasten today,
There is room for us all,
There is somewhere a soul you can win;
Will you longer delay?
Hear the pitiful call
Of the souls that are fettered in sin.

Hasten, Lord, the glorious time
When, beneath Messiah’s sway,
Every nation, every clime,
Shall the Gospel call obey.
Mightiest kings His power shall own,
Heathen tribes His Name adore;
Satan and his host o’erthrown,
Bound in chains, shall hurt no more.
As when soft and gentle showers
Fall upon the thirsty plain,
Springing grass and blooming flowers,
Clothe the wilderness again;
So Thy Spirit shall descend,
Softening every stony heart,
And its sweetest influence lend,
All that’s lovely to impart.
Then shall wars and tumults cease,
Then be banished grief and pain,
Righteousness and joy and peace,
Undisturbed shall ever reign.
Bless we, then, our gracious Lord,
Ever praise His glorious Name;
All His mighty acts record;
All His wondrous love proclaim.
This hymn was origin­al­ly writ­ten in 4-line vers­es.With a tune of a 
dif­ferent me­ter, the omit­ted can be used, as well:
Time shall sun and moon obscure,
Seas be dried, and rocks be riv’n.
But His reign shall still endure,
Endless as the days of Heav’n.

Hasten, sinner, to be wise!
Stay not for the morrow’s sun:
Wisdom if you still despise,
Harder is it to be won.
Hasten, mercy, to implore!
Stay not for the morrow’s sun,
Lest thy season should be o’er,
Ere this evening’s stage be run.
Hasten, sinner, to return!
Stay not for the morrow’s sun,
Lest thy lamp should fail to burn
Ere salvation’s work is done.
Hasten, sinner, to be blest!
Stay not for the morrow’s sun,
Lest perdition thee arrest,
Ere the morrow is begun.

O my Savior, I am weary!
Let my cry to Thee ascend
While in humble supplication
Now before Thy throne I bend!
Weak and helpless, yet believing,
Casting all my care on Thee,
I am hoping, trusting, praying;
Have compassion, Lord, on me!
O my Savior, tho’ unworthy,
I have nowhere else to go;
Thou canst pardon my transgressions,
Thou canst wash me white as snow!
O my Savior, by Thy Spirit
Thou hast called me o’er and o’er;
Now repentant I am coming;
Lord, my wand’ring soul restore!
O my Savior, do not leave me
Here to perish at Thy throne;
In Thy tender, loving mercy
Cleanse and make me all Thine own!

You’re starting, my boy, on life’s journey,
Along the grand highway of life;
You’ll meet with a thousand temptations—
Each city with evil is rife.
This world is a stage of excitement,
There’s danger wherever you go;
But if you are tempted to weakness,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!
Have courage, my boy, to say No!
Have courage, my boy, to say No!
Have courage, my boy,
Have courage, my boy,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!
In courage, my boy, lies your safety,
When you the long journey begin,
Your trust in a heavenly Father
Will keep you unspotted from sin.
Temptations will go on increasing,
As streams from a rivulet flow;
But if you’d be true to your manhood,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!
Be careful in choosing companions,
Seek only the brave and the true,
And stand by your friends when in trial,
Ne’er changing the old for the new;
And when by false friends you are tempted
The taste of the wine cup to know,
With firmness, with patience and kindness,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!

Have faith in God when your pathway is lonely.
He sees and knows all the way you have trod;
Never alone are the least of His children;
Have faith in God, have faith in God.
Have faith in God when your prayers are unanswered,
Your earnest plea He will never forget;
Wait on the lord, trust His word and be patient,
Have faith in God.He'll answer yet.
Have faith in God in your pain and your sorrow,
His heart is touched with your grief and despair;
Cast all your cares and your burdens upon Him,
And leave them there, oh, leave them there.
Have faith in God though all else fall about you;
Have faith in God, He provides for His own:
He cannot fail though all kingdoms shall perish.
He rules.He reigns upon His throne.
Have faith in God, He's on His throne,
Have faith in God, He watches over His own;
He cannot fail, He must prevail,
Have faith in God, Have faith in God.

Have mercy on us, God most high,
Who lift our hearts to Thee;
Have mercy on us worms of earth,
Most holy Trinity.
Most ancient of all mysteries!
Before Thy throne we lie;
Have mercy now, most Merciful,
Most holy Trinity.
When heaven and earth were yet unmade,
When time was yet unknown,
Thou, in Thy bliss and majesty,
Didst live and love alone.
Thou wert not born; there was no fount
From which Thy Being flowed;
There is no end which Thou canst reach;
But Thou art simply God.
How wonderful creation is,
The work that Thou didst bless;
And oh, what then must Thou be like,
Eternal Loveliness!
How beautiful the angels are,
The saints how bright in bliss;
But with Thy beauty, Lord, compared,
How dull, how poor is this.
O listen, then, most pitiful,
To Thy poor creature’s heart:
It blesses Thee that Thou art God;
That Thou art what Thou art.
Most ancient of all mysteries!
Still at Thy throne we lie;
Have mercy now, most Merciful,
Most holy Trinity.

Have mercy, Lord, on me,
As Thou wert ever kind;
Let me, oppressed with loads of guilt,
Thy wonted mercy find.
Wash off my foul offense,
And cleanse me from my sin;
For I confess my crimes, and see
How great my guilt has been.
The joy Thy favor gives
Let me again obtain,
And Thy free Spirit’s firm support
My fainting soul sustain.
To God the Father, Son,
And Spirit glory be,
As ’twas, and is, and shall be so
To all eternity.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after Thy will,
While I am waiting, yielded and still.
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
Power, all power, surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Hold o’er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit ’till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me.

Have thy affections been nailed to the cross?
Is thy heart right with God?
Dost thou count all things for Jesus but loss?
Is thy heart right with God?
Is thy heart right with God,
Washed in the crimson flood,
Cleansed and made holy, humble and lowly,
Right in the sight of God?
Hast thou dominion o’er self and o’er sin?
Is thy heart right with God?
Over all evil without and within?
Is thy heart right with God?
Is there no more condemnation for sin?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does Jesus rule in the temple within?
Is thy heart right with God?
Are all thy pow’rs under Jesus’ control?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does He each moment abide in thy soul?
Is thy heart right with God?

“She hath done what she could," said the kind, loving Savior,
When the ointment so precious was poured on His head;
By the hand of a sinner redeemed through His mercy,
Her contrition displayed by the tears that she shed.
Are we bringing the gift of true love to the Savior?
Are we honoring Jesus so gentle and good?
Oh, how sweet it will be when our service is ended
If we hear His voice say, “Ye have done what ye could!" 
Have we done what we could in the white fields around us,
Where the ripe grain for reapers invitingly waits?
Have we done what we could leading souls out of darkness
Into light that is shining through heavenly gates? 
Have we done what we could in extending the Kingdom,
That in power and glory shall ever increase?
Have we done what we could filling earth with the homage
Of the Savior whose praises shall nevermore cease?

Have you any room for Jesus,
He who bore your load of sin?
As He knocks and asks admission,
Sinners, will you let Him in?
Room for Jesus, King of Glory!
Hasten now His Word obey;
Swing the heart’s door widely open,
Bid Him enter while you may.
Room for pleasure, room for business,
But for Christ the Crucified,
Not a place that He can enter,
In the heart for which He died?
Have you any room for Jesus,
As in grace He calls again?
O today is time accepted,
Tomorrow you may call in vain.
Room and time now give to Jesus,
Soon will pass God’s day of grace;
Soon thy heart left cold and silent,
And thy Savior’s pleading cease.

Have ye been to Nazareth,
Lowly, yet so fair?
Yes, we sought His humble town,
Found our Master there!
Did He dwell in palace fair,
Holding kingly sway?
Nay, we found a Carpenter,
Toiling day by day!
In life’s Nazareth we seek,
Christ, the Master meek,
In our toil from day to day,
Find our Lord for aye!
Did ye find at Nazareth,
Christ the Son of God?
Yea, He was the Son of Man,
Earthly paths He trod.
Did ye find a blessing there
Ever to abide?
Yea, by Him the toilsome tasks
E’er are glorified.
Is there light from Nazareth,
Daily life to crown?
Yes, the glory streams afar,
Distant years adown.
Will the Lord of Nazareth,
Friend and Comrade be?
All unseen He dwells with us,
As in Galilee!

Ye are the temples, Jesus hath spoken,
Temples of God’s holy Spirit divine;
Have ye received Him, bidden Him enter,
Make His abode in that poor heart of thine? 
Have ye received, since ye believed,
The blessed Holy Ghost?
He who has promised, gift of the Father,
Have ye received the Holy Ghost? 
He who has pardoned surely will cleanse thee,
All of the dross of thy nature refine;
Cleansed from all sin, His power will enter,
Fill you and thrill you with power divine.
Showers of mercy, fullness of blessing,
Ever the Spirit’s indwelling attend;
’Tis this enduement, power of service,
Fruits for your labor He surely will send.
Weary of wand’ring, come into Canaan,
Feast on the fullness and fat of the land;
Feed on the manna, dwell in the sunshine,
Led by His Spirit and kept by His hand.

O blessed Jesus, for Thee we are waiting,
Waiting in joy for that glorious morning dawn;
Thou hast a remnant that love Thy appearing;
Welcome Thy coming, dear Lord, for Thine own.
Have you a welcome down in your bosom,
For Christ to come this very day in final doom?
Yes, hallelujah! come, my Redeemer,
Even this moment, oh, come, Jesus, come.
Lo, Thou art coming, the heavens betoken,
Foreboding wonders astonish eye and ear;
Omens now thunder the signs Thou hast spoken,
Truly, O Savior, Thy coming is near.
Thrones have arisen and crumbled to ruin,
Since we await Thy returning from above;
Sinners emboldened say, “Where is His coming?"
Truth disbelieving, Thy wrath they must prove.
Many ungrateful, despise and reject Thee,
Others professing by works deny Thee more;
But all the ransomed, Thy bride meek and holy,
Joyfully welcome Thy voice at the door.

Have you any room for Jesus,
He who bore your load of sin?
As He knocks and asks admission,
Sinners, will you let Him in?
Room for Jesus, King of Glory!
Hasten now His Word obey;
Swing the heart’s door widely open,
Bid Him enter while you may.
Room for pleasure, room for business,
But for Christ the Crucified,
Not a place that He can enter,
In the heart for which He died?
Have you any room for Jesus,
As in grace He calls again?
O today is time accepted,
Tomorrow you may call in vain.
Room and time now give to Jesus,
Soon will pass God’s day of grace;
Soon thy heart left cold and silent,
And thy Savior’s pleading cease.

Have you any time for Jesus,
While the fleeting moments roll?
Is this mortal life so busy
That you cannot save you soul? 
Soon the summons from the portals
Of the mansions in the sky
May be sounding your departure;
You must then take time to die.
Have you any time for Jesus?
Can it be, life’s journey through,
That you have no time to serve Him
Who has spent His life for you? 
Time for business, time for pleasure,
Time to revel on in sin—
Will you not take time for Jesus?
Oh, invite Him to come in.
If you have no time for Jesus
Ere you pass beyond the blue,
In the resurrection morning
He will have no time for you.

Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you washed in the blood,
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you walking daily by the Savior’s side?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;
There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
O be washed in the blood of the Lamb!

Have you ever heard a duck praise the Lord?
A duck praise the Lord, a duck praise the Lord
Have you ever heard a duck praise the Lord?
This is what he says.
Quack quack quack quack quack quack
quack quack quack
quack quack quack praise the Lord
kitten (meow)
Fish (blub)
Bell (ding)
All (ding, blub, meow, quack)

Have you ever heard the story
Of the Babe of Bethlehem,
Who was worshipped by the angels
And the wise and holy men?
How He taught the learned doctors
In the temple far away?
O I’m glad, so glad, to tell you,
He is just the same today!
He is just the same today,
He is just the same today,
Seeking those who are astray,
And saving souls along the way.
O I’m glad, so glad, to tell you,
He is just the same today.
Have you ever heard the story
How He walked upon the sea,
To His dear disciples tossing
On the waves of Galilee?
How the waves in angry motion
Quickly did His will obey?
O I’m glad, so glad, to tell you
He is just the same today!
Have you ever heard of Jesus
Praying in Gethsemane,
And the ever thrilling story,
How He died upon the tree,
Cruel thorns His forehead piercing,
As His Spirit passed away?
This He did for you, my brother,
And He’s just the same today!

Have you ever tried to bear your burdens
All alone? All alone?
Don’t you know there’s One Who waits to help you,
Who will make all your burdens His own?
When I have burdens to bear which no one can share,
I take them to Jesus, the Man of Calvary;
When I have crosses to bear, my Savior is there,
And always takes the heavy end, and gives the light to me.
Don’t you know He trod the winepress for you?
All alone? All alone?
And the burden that He bore in meekness,
Such a burden no other has known.
Don’t you know that He has bought your pardon
All alone? All alone?
And your gratitude for such a mercy
Unto Jesus you never have shown.

Have you on the Lord believed?
Still there’s more to follow.
Of His grace have you received?
Still there’s more to follow.
Oh, the grace the Father shows!
Still there’s more to follow.
Freely He His grace bestows,
Still there’s more to follow.
More and more, more and more,
Always more to follow,
Oh, his matchless, boundless love!
Still there’s more to follow.
Have you felt the Savior near?
Still there’s more to follow.
Does His blessed presence cheer?
Still there’s more to follow.
Oh the love that Jesus shows;
Still there’s more to follow.
Freely He His love bestows,
Still there’s more to follow.
Have you felt the Spirit’s power?
Still there’s more to follow.
Falling like the gentle shower?
Still there’s more to follow.
Oh, the power the Spirit shows,
Still there’s more to follow.
Freely He His power bestows,
Still there’s more to follow.

Have you prayed all night, till the break of day,
And the morning light drove the dark away?
Did you linger there, till the morning dew,
In prevailing prayer, did you pray it through?
Did you pray till the answer came,
Did you plead in the Savior’s Name?
Have you prayed all night till the morning light,
Did you pray till the answer came?
Did you pray it through, till the answer came?
There’s a promise true for your faith to claim,
At the place of prayer, Jesus waits for you,
Did you meet Him there, did you pray it through?
As the Master prayed in the garden lone,
Let your prayer be made to the Father’s throne,
If you seek His will, He will answer you,
Are you trusting still, have you prayed it through?

Have you read the story of the cross,
Where Jesus bled and died,
Where your debt was paid by the precious blood
That flowed from His wounded side?
He died of a broken heart for you,
He died of a broken heart;
Oh, wondrous love! for you, for me,
He died of a broken heart.
Have you read how they placed the crown of thorns
Upon His kingly brow,
How He cried, “They know not what they do;
O Father, forgive them now"?
Have you read how the dying thief was saved
While hanging on the tree,
When he looked with pleading eyes and said,
“O Lord, remember me"?
Have you read how in anguish He cried aloud
And died on Calvary?
Have you ever said, “I thank Thee, Lord,
For giving Thy life for me"?

I’m rejoicing night and day
As I walk the narrow way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see.
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.
He abides, He abides.
Hallelujah, He abides with me!
I’m rejoicing night and day
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.
Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree.
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet.
Now the Comforter abides with me.
He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my ev’ry care;
I’m as happy as a bird and just as free.
For the Spirit has control;
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me.
There’s no thirsting for the things
Of the world—they’ve taken wings.
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away.
Now the Comforter abides with me.

A friendless pris’ner at Pilate’s bar,
’Mid the raging mob He stood;
Like wolves that had scented His blood from afar
And eagerly Him pursued;
The voice of these murd’rers was heard as they cried,
Till Jerusalem’s city was stirred;
“Away with Him, let Him be crucified";
But He answered never a word.
The priests and the elders with fiendish spite,
Accused Him of many things;
But His face was radiant with heavenly light,
He could hear the sound of wings;
And Pilate marveled to see Him there,
As each wicked charge he heard,
His mute lips moved as in silent prayer,
But He answered never a word.
With fiercest hatred his foes pressed on,
To kill Him their greatest desire;
The faith of His foll’wers was almost gone,
Must the last faint spark expire?
Will He meekly yield in His dreadful hour,
When a murderer is preferred?
He who raised the dead, has He lost His pow’r?
But He answered never a word.
Then they brought the cross that Barabbas should fill,
He, a murderer, now to go free;
And they laid in on Jesus to bear up the hill,
To purchase salvation for me;
Though hungry and thirsty, and bleeding and cold,
Not a sigh passed His lips that was heard;
He trembled a moment, then sank to the ground,
But He answered never a word.
The rabble with spite and revenge urged them on,
Till He came to Calvary’s brow,
Where they nailed His hands and His feet to the cross—
O sinner, look on him now!
Then raising the cross, oh, what suff’ring and pain!
Till the earth and the heavens were stirred,
But the suffering Jesus with meekness endured,
But He answered never a word.
But there hung by His side a thief, broken and sad,
With sins that were all his own,
And he cried, “Dear Lord, remember me
When Thou sittest on Thy throne";
And the Savior turned and looked upon him,
His compassion deep was stirred;
And peace, sweet peace He shed o’er that soul—
He could answer him with a word.

“He is risen," said the angel to the women,
When they came to see Him sleeping in the cave;
Jesus burst the mighty bars of death asunder,
And arose to reign triumphant from the grave.
He arose, my Savior,
He arose, my Savior,
He arose, my Savior,
Triumphant from the grave.
He is risen, surely death is now abolished:
Grave, where is thy vict’ry? Death, where is thy sting?
Jesus flashes light into the darkened valley;
Swell the mighty , men and angels sing.
He is risen, let the nations hear the music,
Let the gospel truth reach every distant plain;
Let the tidings roll that every guilty captive
May be fully free and help to praise His name.
He is risen, hence the fear of that grim monster
Is forever banished to the shades of night;
And the grave and death have lost their wretched terror
While we live on earth or take our upward flight.

Prelude
He became incarnate, Christ the King of glory,
He became incarnate
Shepherds were keeping their nightly watch on Bethlem’s plain,
“Fear not, O brothers," the angel addressed them,
Wonderful brightness around them shone so marv’lously.
“Joy I proclaim through the birth of the Savior."
He became incarnate, Christ the King of glory,
He became incarnate
“This sign I’ll show you by which you’ll find the Lord of all."
Suddenly heavenly hosts sang forth praises.
“In David’s city you’ll find Him in a lowly stall."
“Glory to God Who gives peace on earth good will."

My precious Savior suffered pain and agony
He bore it all (Freely bore it all)
That I might live (I with Him might live)
He broke the bonds of sin and set the captive free
He bore it all (all) that (that) I might (might) live (in His presence live)
He bore it all (Jesus bore it all) that I might see His shining face (see His 
Shining face)
He bore it all (Freely bore it all)
That I might live (I with Him might live)
I stood condemned to die (stood condemned to die) but Jesus took my place 
(freely took my place)
He bore it all (all) that (that) I might (might) live (in His presence live)
Up Calvary's hill in shame the blessed Savior trod
He bore it all (Freely bore it all)
That I might live (I with Him might live)
Between two thieves they crucified the Son of God
He bore it all (all) that (that) I might (might) live (in His presence live)
He bore it all (all) that (that) I might (might) live (in His presence live)

He brought me to His banqueting table
And his banner over me is love 
His banner over me is love
He lifts me up to heavenly places
I am safe and secure in the rock of all ages
He is the way, the truth and the life
In Christ there is no condemnation
I am my beloved's and He is mine
He placed my feet on firm foundation
And now I am living in the new creation
I am seated with Him in the heavenly places.

My heart was distressed 'neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah!
He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling while here I remain,
But stand by His grace until the crown I gain.
He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise;
By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, I'm happy and free.
I'll praise my Redeemer, Who has rescued me.
I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.

I’m a tree I can bend
When the storm comes rushing in
I’m strong my roots run deep
But when problems come along
There’s just a part of me that forgets all He's done
He never does, He never does
He never gives up on the weary
He never gives up on the weak
And every time I’ve fallen down
He lifts me to my feet (lifts me to my feet)
In your eyes I’m a hopeless case
But that is just because
You may have all but given up
He never does, He never does
He forgives and forgets
Puts my sins as far as east is
From the west
And then hopes for the best
There’s just a part of me that doubts that great a love
He never does, He never does
And when I feel like hope is gone
His precious mercy comes along
And though I don’t deserve His grace and His love
He calls me his child just because, just because
He never will, He’ll never give up on me
He never does, no, He never does
I’m His child and forever I’ll be
He never does
Some folks may give up on you
But He never will

He can turn the tides
And calm the angry sea.
He alone decides
Who writes a symphony.
He lights ev'ry star
That makes our darkness bright.
He keeps watch all through
Each long and lonely night.
He still finds the time
To hear a child's first prayer.
Saint or sinner call
And always find Him there.
Though it makes him sad
To see the way we live,
He'll always say, "I forgive." 
He can grant a wish
Or make a dream come true.
He can paint the clouds
And turn the gray to blue.
He alone knows where
To find the rainbow's end.
He alone can see
What lies beyond the bend.
He can touch a tree
And turn the leaves to gold.
He knows every lie
That you and I have told.

Jesus, my Savior, is precious to me,
He careth for me;
Loving and keeping me happy and free,
He careth for me.
He careth for me, He careth for me,
He loves and He keeps me,
I’m happy and free.
He careth for me, He careth for me,
He loves and He keeps me,
He careth for me.
Tho’ storms and tempests may break o’er my soul,
He careth for me;
Safely I’m kept under Jesus’ control,
He careth for me.
When I am tempted and wander astray,
He careth for me;
When I grow weary and faint by the way,
He careth for me.
Tho’ my path leads me where dangers betide,
He careth for me;
Still He is with me, my Shield and my Guide,
He careth for me.

He comes! He comes with trumpet sound,
To wake the slumb’ring nations ’round;
His pard’ning love no more is found—
He comes! He comes!
The dead in Christ shall then arise,
To meet their Savior in the skies,
No more a bleeding sacrifice—
He comes! He comes! 
He comes no more in priestly dress;
Each eye shall see, each tongue confess;
To judge the world in righteousness
He comes! He comes!
The earth shall melt, the mountains quake,
The sea shall roar, the heavens shake,
The trumpet sounds, the dead awake—
He comes! He comes! 
Dear sinners, what will be your fate?
The cry will be, “Too late, too late!
To enter in at heaven’s gate!"
He comes! He comes!
“Let rocks and mountains on us fall,"
In vain at mercy’s door they call;
Now doomed to swift destruction all—
He comes! He comes! 
His loved, His own all hear His voice,
Obey His call, in Him rejoice;
The way of life has been their choice;
He comes! He comes!
Now to those mansions fair and bright
They take their everlasting flight;
There they shall walk with Him in white—
He comes! He comes! 
Behold, what wonder greets mine eye—
Ten thousand angels in the sky!
The end has come, destruction’s nigh,
He comes! He comes!
Oh, fearful scene! creation groans,
While loud above the trumpet tones
What peals of joy! What piercing moans!
He comes! He comes! 

He comes to us as one unknown,
a breath unseen, unheard;
as though within a heart of stone,
or shriveled seed in darkness sown,
a pulse of being stirred.
He comes when souls in silence lie
and thoughts of day depart,
half-seen upon the inward eye,
a falling star across the sky
of night within the heart.
He comes to us in sound of seas,
the ocean's fume and foam;
yet small and still upon the breeze,
a wind that stirs the tops of trees,
a voice to call us home.
He comes in love as once he came
by flesh and blood and birth;
to bear within our mortal frame
a life, a death, a saving name
for every child of earth.
He comes in truth when faith is grown;
believed, obeyed, adored:
the Christ in all the scriptures shown,
as yet unseen, but not unknown,
our Savior, and our Lord.

He comes! He comes! the Judge severe!
The seventh trumpet speaks Him near;
His lightnings flash, His thunders roll;
How welcome to the faithful soul!
From Heav’n angelic voices sound;
See the almighty Jesus crowned,
Girt with omnipotence and grace!
And glory decks the Savior’s face.
Descending on His great white throne,
He claims the kingdoms for His own;
The kingdoms all obey His Word,
And hail Him their triumphant Lord.
Shout, all the people of the sky,
And all the saints of the Most High;
Our Lord, Who now His right obtains,
Forever and forever reigns.

Jesus is coming! go, herald the tidings
Far over the land and the sea;
Jesus is coming to gather the ransomed,
Redeemed by His death on the tree.
Angels attending, the heavens descending—
All language our joy will transcend,
When we shall see Him, the King in His beauty,
Our Bridegroom, Redeemer, and Friend.
Jesus is coming, our Savior and Lover divine;
Soon in His glory the ransomed of ages will shine;
Ages on ages we’ll reign with our King on His throne;
Wonderful story! We’ll share in His glory,
Redeemed by His mercy divine.
Lift up your heads and rejoice, O ye righteous,
Your perfect redemption is nigh;
Swiftly the darkness of midnight approaches,
“He cometh" shall sound from the sky.
Long has the battle been waged against evil
By suffering saints here below.
Jesus is coming to banish our sorrow,
And lead us where tears never flow.
Come, dear Lord Jesus, Thy promise fulfilling;
“Come quickly!" our souls cry to Thee:
Long has the world been enthralled by the tempter,
The curse is on land and on sea.
Yet Thou shalt triumph, the nations subduing,
The truth of the Word cannot fail;
God’s wondrous glory, like ocean’s deep billows,
To earth’s farthest bounds shall prevail.

He did it again
He did it again
He showed the death-defying
Faith-reyling wonder of his might
Remember the miracle
Brought from his hand
Still see him working in this land
He did it again
Remember when Moses told the Pharaoh
He should let the people go
And if he would not cooperate
The power he would show
Sadly Pharaoh's heart was hardened
And to Moses he declined
To obey the Lord's commandments
He just would not change his mind
One by one the Lord sent down the plagues
Upon Egyptian land
Showed his mighty awesome power
Just to help them understand
That Jehovah is the true God
And there is no other way
He'll deliver us from bondage
He can part the sea today
Remember when God had told Elijah
He'd send rain upon the land
That was famished from a famine
That they long could not withstand
Well, he called upon the prophets
Of a heathen god named Ball
To arrange a simple contest
And to let the prophets wail
So, from the morning 'til the evning
All the prophets of that god
Were distraught for lack of action
(a divinity facade!)
Yet Elijah called Jehovah 
To bring fire down and then
He released his might from heaven
Showed his power once again
Now our God is alive and well
Overcoming the powers of Hell
If you pray and believe it's true
There's no doubt what our God will do
Still see him working in the land
He did it again
He did it again
Again! 

My blessed Lord was crucified,
The day was dark, and grief was wide,
For hope was crushed and all seemed vain,
Until that Savior rose again.
Ring out the blessed news again!
Oh! bear aloft the strain;
The mighty Lord is ris’n in power,
He died, but not in vain!
He brings His great salvation nigh,
And on His love bids us rely;
He bought our peace through grief and pain;
But oh! He did not die in vain!
O, wondrous news of life and love!
That Jesus lives and reigns above!
He made the path to glory plain;
Ah, no! He did not die in vain.

He didn't bring us this far to leave us
He didn't teach us to swim to let us drown
He didn't build His home in us to move away
He didn't lift us up to let us down
There are some promises in a letter
Written a long, long time ago
They're not getting older, they're getting better
Because He still wants us to know
He didn't bring us this far to leave us
He didn't teach us to swim to let us drown
He didn't build His home in us to move away
He didn't lift us up to let us down (to let us down, let us down)
He didn't lift us up to let us down
I read those promises in His letter
And now I claim them for my own
Filling my heart and making life better
And I just wanted you to know
Never use the word defeat
Claim His promises, every one of them
And every spoken word He'll hear
Because we're everything to Him
He didn't lift us up to let us down

I saw One hanging on a tree,
In agony and blood;
He fixed His languid eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.
Oh, can it be, upon a tree
The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled,
My heart is filled,
To think He died for me!
Sure, never, till my latest breath,
Can I forget that look:
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Tho' not a word He spoke.
Oh, can it be, upon a tree
The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled,
My heart is filled,
To think He died for me!
My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair;
I saw my sins His blood had spilt
And helped to nail Him there.
Oh, can it be, upon a tree
The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled,
My heart is filled,
To think He died for me!
Alas! I know not what I did,
But now my tears are vain:
Where shall my trembling soul be hid?
For I the Lord have slain.
Oh, can it be, upon a tree
The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled,
My heart is filled,
To think He died for me!
A second look He gave, which said,
"I freely all forgive:
This blood is for thy ransom paid,
I die that thou may'st live."
Oh, can it be, upon a tree
The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled,
My heart is filled,
To think He died for me!

He dies! the Friend of sinners dies!
Lo! Salem’s daughters weep around;
A solemn darkness veils the skies,
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.
Come, saints, and drop a tear or two
For Him who groaned beneath your load:
He shed a thousand drops for you,
A thousand drops of richer blood.
Here’s love and grief beyond degree:
The Lord of Glory dies for men!
But lo! what sudden joys we see,
Jesus, the dead, revives again!
The rising God forsakes the tomb;
The tomb in vain forbids His rise;
Cherubic legions guard Him home,
And shout Him welcome to the skies.
Break off your fears, ye saints, and tell
How high your great Deliv’rer reigns;
Sing how He spoiled the hosts of hell,
And led the monster death in chains!
Say, “Live forever, wondrous King!
Born to redeem, and strong to save;"
Then ask the monster, “Where’s thy sting?"
And, “Where’s thy vict’ry, boasting grave?"

He expecteth, He expecteth!
Down the stream of time,
Still the words come softly ringing,
Like a chime.
Oft times faint, now waxing louder
As the hour draws near,
When the King in all His glory,
Shall appear.
He is waiting with long patience
For His crowning day,
For that kingdom which shall never
Pass away.
And till ev’ry tribe and nation
Bow before His throne,
He expecteth loyal service
From His own.
He expecteth—but He heareth
Still the bitter cry
From earth’s millions, “Come and help us,
For we die."
He expecteth—doth He see us
Busy here and there,
Heedless of those pleading accents
Of despair?
Shall we—dare we disappoint Him?
Brethren, let us rise!
He Who died for us is watching
From the skies.
Watching till His royal banner
Floateth far and wide,
Till He seeth of His travail
Satisfied!

He feedeth His flock like a shepherd,
And tenderly guideth their way;
His banner of mercy is o’er them,
Their refuge by night and by day.
O wonderful Savior,
Precious Redeemer and Friend;
He loveth the faithful that trust Him,
And loveth them unto the end.
He never will leave nor forsake them,
His own He hath promised to keep;
So great was His love and compassion,
He laid down His life for the sheep.
He feedeth His flock like a shepherd,
And makes them in Him to rejoice;
They walk in the light of His presence,
And know the glad sound of His voice.
He feedeth His flock like a shepherd,
And oh, ’twill be rapture untold,
When all shall be gathered together,
At home in the dear upper fold.

Oh Jesus, he gave her water
You know my Jesus gave her water
Oh Jesus gave her water
And it was not from the well
Well, there was a woman from Samaria
She came to the well to get some water
It was there she met a stranger
And he did her story tell
She left my savior singing
She came back to him bringing
The time she had water
And it was not from the well
Well on that woman he had pity
She ran back to the city
Crying glory hallelujah
I'm gonna let his praises swell
Every time she'd doubt him
She's stop and think about him
The man that gave her that living water
And it was not from the well
Oh, gave her water
Jesus gave her water
Oh Jesus he gave her water
I'm gonna let his praises swell
Jesus gave that woman water
He gave her that living lasting water
Oh, and it was not from the well

He took my burdens all away, up to a brighter day
He gave me a song (He gave me a song), a wonderful song (a wonderful song)
A wonderful song I now can sing, in my heart joybells ring
He gave me a song (He gave me a song), a wonderful song (a wonderful song)
He gave me a song (He gave me a song), to sing about (to sing about)
He lifted me (He lifted me) from sin and doubt (from sin and doubt)
O, praise His name (O praise His name), He is my King (He is my King)
A wonderful song (a wonderful song) He is to me (He is to me)
I am redeemed no more to die, never to say goodbye
He gave me a song (He gave me a song), a wonderful song (a wonderful song)
And some of these days in that fair land, sing with the grand
He gave me a song (He gave me a song), a wonderful song (a wonderful song)

Jesus came to earth by a lowly birth,
Gave Himself as an offering of matchless worth;
To His own He came in His Father’s Name,
But they scorned to receive Him their King.
But as many as received Him to them He gave the power
The power to become the sons of God;
But as many as received Him to them He gave the power
To become the sons of God.
Grace and pardon free, all for you and me,
Every one who receives Him a son may be;
For His blood He spilt to remove our guilt,
When He offered Himself once for all.
Not by works we come as the Father’s son,
To receive as a welcome the words “well done";
Lest we fain would boast as a mighty host,
Knowing not ’tis the free gift of God.

You give the victory to all (You give the victory to all)
You give the victory to all
Save me from my enemies and troubles great and small
You give the victory to all (You give the victory to all) 
Your love is all I need to live (Your love is all I need to live)
Your love is all I need to live
Lead me to the victory that only You can give
Your love is all I need to live (Your love is all I need to live) 
Your home is where I want to be (Your home is where I want to be)
Your home is where I want to be
I will not be satisfied until your face I see
Your home is where I want to be (Your home is where I want to be) 
You give the victory to all (Oh, You give the victory to all)
You give the victory to all (Oh, You give the victory to all)
You give the victory to all (Oh, You give the victory to all)
You give the victory to all 

Sorrow and care may meet,
The tempest cloud may low’r,
The surge of sin may beat
Upon earth’s troubled shore;
God doth His own in safety keep,
He giveth His beloved sleep,
He giveth His beloved sleep.
The din of war may roll,
With all her raging flight,
Grief may oppress the soul,
Throughout the weary nigh;
God doth His own in safety keep,
He giveth His beloved sleep,
He giveth His beloved sleep.
In childhood’s winsome page,
In manhood’s joyous bloom,
In feebleness and age,
In death’s dark gathering gloom,
God will His own in safety keep,
He giveth His beloved sleep,
He giveth His beloved sleep.

He giveth more grace as our burdens grow greater,
He sendeth more strength as our labors increase;
To added afflictions He addeth His mercy,
To multiplied trials He multiplies peace.
When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
When our strength has failed ere the day is half done,
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources
Our Father’s full giving is only begun.
His love has no limits, His grace has no measure,
His power no boundary known unto men;
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus
He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again.

He had everything (everything he wanted) (yes he had it all), everything that he 
dreamed (that he dreamed) (all he dreamed)
He had everything (everything he wanted) (yes he had it all), all he wanted it 
seemed (that he wanted) (all it seemed)
But the more he had and the more he learned
There was something not there
To fill the void within him, Oh where - Oh where 
Everything he gathered he had made by himself
Or so he always had believed
Self-reliant living always brought him success
Just consider all he had achieved
But the clock was running out on going his way
Placing all his hopes upon his wealth
Sooner than later he would come face to face
No man can live unto himself (unto himself) 
Everything he touched it seemed would turn into gold
Or at least it always did appear
As his heart was slowing down and growing so cold
Finding satisfaction no where near
Then his body lost its way, began to shut down
Leaving him with nothing to control
Abruptly showing him with nothing to live for
And now nothing within his soul (in his soul) 
(Everything he wanted, that he dreamed) 

He has come, the Christ of God:
Left for us His glad abode;
Stooping from His throne of bliss
To this darksome wilderness.
He has come, the Prince of Peace:
Come to bid our sorrows cease;
Come to scatter with His light
All the shadows of our night.
He, the mighty King, has come,
Making this poor earth His home:
Come to bear our sin’s sad load,
Son of David, Son of God.
He has come, Whose Name of grace
Speaks deliverance to our race:
Left for us His glad abode,
Son of Mary, Son of God.
Unto us a Child is born:
Ne’er has earth beheld a morn
Among all the morns of time,
Half so glorious in its prime.
Unto us a Son is given:
He has come from God’s own Heaven,
Bringing with Him from above
Holy peace and holy love.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life with the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine!
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love
I’ll shout with the millions on high.

I am so happy in Christ today,
That I go singing along my way;
Yes, I’m so happy to know and say,
“Jesus included me, too."
Jesus included me, yes, He included me,
When the Lord said, “Whosoever," He included me;
Jesus included me, yes, He included me,
When the Lord said, “Whosoever," He included me.
Gladly I read, “Whosoever may
Come to the fountain of life today";
But when I read it I always say,
“Jesus included me, too."
Ever God’s Spirit is saying, “Come!"
Hear the Bride saying, “No longer roam";
But I am sure while they’re calling home,
Jesus included me, too.
“Freely come drink," words the soul to thrill!
O with what joy they my heart do fill!
For when He said, “Whosoever will,"
Jesus included me, too.

He is able to deliver thee, O sinner;
He will drive the night away;
He’s the star of perfect day;
He will shine from heaven in thy heart forever.
He is able, He is able
To deliver thee.
He is able to deliver thee, O sinner;
See the myriad worlds above,
And the one on which we move—
They were made by our eternal God of power.
He is able to deliver thee, O sinner;
See your life is in His hand,
Thus you live at His command;
He’s the source of good, the ever blessed Giver.
He is able to deliver thee, O sinner;
He has quenched the fire of yore,
Stopped the lion’s rage and roar,
He has raised the dead and healed the spotted leper.
He is able to deliver thee, O sinner;
For He told the king His dream,
Stopped the Jordan’s flowing stream;
Healed the lame, the blind, the palsy—what a Savior!

’Tis the grandest theme through the ages rung;
’Tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue;
’Tis the grandest theme that the world e’er sung,
“Our God is able to deliver thee."
He is able to deliver thee,
He is able to deliver thee;
Though by sin oppressed, go to Him for rest;
“Our God is able to deliver thee."
’Tis the grandest theme in the earth or main;
’Tis the grandest theme for a mortal strain;
’Tis the grandest theme, tell the world again,
“Our God is able to deliver thee."
’Tis the grandest theme, let the tidings roll,
To the guilty heart, to the sinful soul;
Look to God in faith, He will make thee whole,
“Our God is able to deliver thee."

There is constant joy abiding
In Christ my Lord and King;
Of His love that passeth knowledge
My heart and tongue shall sing.
He is all in all to me,
And my song of songs shall be,
Hallelujah, O my Savior,
I am trusting only Thee.
When my path is veiled in shadows,
And clouds above me roll,
I can smile amid the tempest,
His glory fills my soul.
I can see his bow of promise
Through tears and trials deep;
I can hear His voice like music,
That lulls my care to sleep.
I shall yet behold and praise Him,
And dwell in perfect peace
In the golden land of beauty,
Where cloud and wave shall cease.

He is born, the holy Child,
Play the oboe and bagpipes merrily!
He is born, the holy Child,
Sing we all of the Savior mild.
Through long ages of the past,
Prophets have foretold His coming;
Through long ages of the past,
Now the time has come at last!
O how lovely, O how pure
Is this perfect Child of heaven;
O how lovely, O how pure
Gracious gift to humankind!
Jesus, Lord of all the world,
Coming as a Child among us,
Jesus, Lord of all the world,
Grant to us Thy heavenly peace.

He is coming, the “Man of Sorrows,"
Now exalted on high;
He is coming with loud hosannas,
In the clouds of the sky.
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
He is coming again;
And with joy we shall gather round Him,
At His coming to reign.
He is coming, our loving Savior,
Blessed Lamb that was slain;
In the glory of God the Father,
On the earth He shall reign.
He is coming, our Lord and Master,
Our Redeemer and King;
We shall see Him in all His beauty,
And His praise we shall sing.
He shall gather His chosen people,
Who are called by His Name;
And the ransomed of every nation
For His own He shall claim.

Lift up your heads, pilgrims aweary,
See day’s approach now crimson the sky;
Night shadows flee, and your Beloved,
Awaited with longing, at last draweth nigh.
He is coming again, He is coming again,
The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
He is coming again, He is coming again,
With power and great glory, He is coming again!
Dark was the night, sin warred against us;
Heavy the load of sorrow we bore;
But now we see signs of His coming;
Our hearts glow within us, joy’s cup runneth o’er!
O blessed hope! O blissful promise!
Filling our hearts with rapture divine;
O day of days! Hail Thy appearing!
Thy transcendent glory forever shall shine.
Even so, come, precious Lord Jesus;
Creation waits redemption to see;
Caught up in clouds, soon we shall meet Thee;
O blessed assurance, forever with Thee!

He is coming, He is coming,
Not as once He came before,
Wailing Infant born in weakness
On a lowly stable floor;
But upon His cloud of glory,
In the crimson tinted sky,
Where we see the golden sunrise,
In the rosy distance lie.
He is coming, He is coming,
Not in pain, and shame, and woe,
With the thorn crown on His forehead,
And the blood drops trickling slow;
But with diadem upon Him,
And the scepter in His hand,
And the dead all ranged before Him,
Raised from death, hell, sea and land.
He is coming, He is coming,
Not as once He wandered through
All the hostile land of Judah,
With His followers poor and few;
But with all the holy angels
Waiting round His judgment seat,
And the chosen twelve Apostles,
Sitting crowned at His feet.
He is coming, He is coming,
Let His lowly first estate,
And His tender love, so teach us
That in faith and hope we wait,
Till in glory eastward burning,
Our redemption draweth near,
And we see the sign in heaven
Of our Judge and Savior dear.

When I was in trouble, my way was dark as night,
But Jesus gave me comfort, and brought me to the light;
He took away my sorrow, and made my burden light,
He is everything to me.
If it wasn’t for the Lord, tell me what would I do?
Oh, tell me, what would I do? Oh, tell me, what would I do?
If it wasn’t for the Lord, tell me, what would I do?
He is everything to me.
He is bread in dry places, He’s water in a thirsty land;
He is my rock and shelter, He holds me by the hand;
And when my friends forsake me, close by my side He’ll stand,
He is everything to me.
So when my life is ended, and I must surely die,
Then He will be my gateway up to that home on high;
And in that golden city, there’ll be no more goodbyes,
He is everything to me.

He is gone—a cloud of light
Has received Him from our sight;
High in Heav’n, where eye of men
Follows not, nor angels’ ken;
Through the veils of time and space,
Passed into the holiest place;
All the toil, the sorrow done,
All the battle fought and won.
He is gone—and we remain
In this world of sin and pain:
In the void which He has left
On this earth, of Him bereft.
We have still His work to do,
We can still His path pursue;
Seek Him both in friend and foe,
In ourselves His image show.
He is gone—we heard Him say,
“Good that I should go away,"
Gone is that dear form and face,
But not gone His present grace;
Though Himself no more we see,
Comfortless we cannot be:
No, His Spirit still is ours,
Quickening, freshening all ours powers.
He is gone—towards their goal
World and church must onward roll;
Far behind we leave the past;
Forward are our glances cast:
Still His words before us range
Through the ages as they change:
Wheresoe’er the truth shall lead,
He will give whate’er we need.
He is gone—but we once more
Shall behold Him as before;
In the heaven of heavens the same,
As on earth He went and came;
In the many mansions there,
Place for us He will prepare;
In that world unseen, unknown,
He and we shall yet be one.
He is gone—but not in vain,
Wait until He comes again:
He is risen, He is not here,
Far above this earthly sphere;
Evermore in heart and mind
There our peace in Him we find:
To our own eternal Friend,
Thitherward let us ascend.

Have you ever heard of Jesus,
How He came from heav’n to earth,
With a name of mighty virtue,
Though by very humble birth?
When the world was held in bondage,
Under Satan’s dismal sway,
Jesus healed their dread diseases—
He is just the same today.
He is just the same today,
He is just the same today;
Yes, He healed in Galilee,
Set the suff’ring captives free,
And He’s just the same today.
Do you see the people gather
Round that great and holy Man,
Bringing all the sick and suff’ring,
Coming to Him all who can?
See Him look with great compassion,
As they fainted by the way!
How He called them gently to Him,
He is just the same today.
Is it true that every sickness 
May be laid at Jesus’ feet?
All my trouble, care, and sorrow,
And I rest in joy complete?
Yes, my brother, every sadness,
If by faith to Him you pray,
He’ll remove with tender mercy,
For He’s just the same today.
Oh, that precious, loving Jesus!
His compassion still the same,
Toward poor sinful, suff’ring mortals
Who seek refuge in His name.
Heed the present invitation,
Oh, you need not stay away!
Just receive His healing favor,
For He’s just the same today.

There is a Shepherd Who cares for His own, and He is mine;
Nothing am I, He’s a King on a throne, but He is mine;
How can He love such a sinner as I, though He is mine,
I cannot fathom though often I try, but He is mine.
He is mine; He is mine;
Though it is wonderful, yet it is true,
That He is mine.
Jesus left Heaven my Savior to be, and He is mine;
I am not worth all He suffered for me, but He is mine;
Though I’m not worthy He dwells in my heart, and He is mine;
From Him I’ll never, no, never depart, for He is mine.
There is a Comforter come from above, He, too, is mine,
Coming to me to reveal Jesus’ love, and that is mine;
Shepherd and Savior, and Comforter, too, They all are mine;
That’s why I know the old story is true, They all are mine.

I know not when the Lord will come,
Or at what hour He may appear,
Whether at midnight or at morn,
Or at what season of the year.
I only know that He is near,
And that His voice I soon shall hear;
I only know that He is near,
And that His voice I soon shall hear;
I know not what of time remains,
To run its course, in this low sphere,
Or what awaits of calm or storm,
Of joy or grief, or hope or fear.
I know not what is yet to run
Of spring or summer, green or sear,
Of death or life, of pain or peace,
Of shade or shine, of song or tear.
The centuries have come and gone,
Dark centuries of absence drear;
I dare not chide the long delay,
Nor ask when I His voice shall hear.
I do not think it can be long,
Till in His glory He appear;
And yet I dare not name the day,
Nor fix the solemn advent year.

Oh, day of awful story—
Jesus is dead!
Sad end to hope of glory—
Jesus is dead!
Behold the stone is rolled away!
And shining ones have come to say:
“He is not here, but is risen!
He is not here, but is risen!"
The night of death is past and gone—
Arise, and greet the glorious morn!
“He is not here, but is risen!
He is not here, but is risen!"
A weary night of weeping—
Jesus is dead!
A night that knew no sleeping—
Jesus is dead!
A day in sorrow dawning—
Jesus is dead!
A sad and gloomy morning—
Jesus is dead!

There is no way I'm gonna fight it
I'm gonna tell you how I feel
There is no reason to deny it
My God is real 
Modern man has thought of ways
To deny my God today
They think they're so educated
They don't need Him
They write their theories to deny Him
But even they can't verify them
But I know that my God is living
Through the evidence He gave 
He is real (He is)
I can see Him in the trees
I can see Him in the children
As they're playing in the leaves (in the leaves)
He is real (He is)
I can see Him in the stars
And if you will let Him in
He will live within your heart (in your heart) 
It's very strange indeed
'Bout these educated men
With the reasoning God gave them
They turn away and deny Him
If they hold but just a portion
Of the intelligence they claim
They would cast aside all foolish pride
And bow down to praise His name 
What is this world coming to
They want us to believe
The complexities of life
They say by accident conceived
Don't ignore the One with power
Creation to achieve (I believe, I believe)
Open up your heart to Him
His blessings you'll receive (hey) 
He is real (He is)
He is real
I can see Him in the children
As they're playing in the leaves (in the leaves)
He is real (my God is real)
I can see Him in the stars
And if you will let Him in
He will live within your heart (in your heart) 
He is real (He is)
I can see Him in the trees
I can see Him in the children
As they're playing in the leaves 

Said the angel, “He is risen!"
Tell it out with joyful voice:
He has burst His three days’ prison;
Let the whole wide earth rejoice:
Death is conquered, we are free,
Christ has won the victory.
Come, ye sad and fearful hearted,
With glad smile and radiant brow!
Death’s long shadows have departed;
All our woes are over now,
Due to passion that He bore—
Sin and pain can vex no more.
Come, with high and holy hymning,
Chant our Lord’s triumphant day;
Not one darksome cloud is dimming
Yonder glorious morning ray,
Breaking over the purple east:
Brighter far our Easter feast.
He is risen, He is risen!
He has opened heaven’s gate:
We are free from sin’s dark prison,
Risen to a holier state;
And a brighter Easter beam
On our longing eyes shall stream.

O trumpet sound a vict’ry call!
And tongues proclaim good news for all:
He is risen! He is risen!
O! Let a thousand hymns break forth,
Proclaiming our Redeemer’s worth!
Give Him glory! Give Him glory!
He is risen! He is risen!
Hallelujah!
He who was slain on our behalf,
Suff’ring beneath His Father’s wrath:
He is risen! He is risen!
He who was hung upon the tree,
Rose from the tomb in victory!
O Christian, are you filled with gloom?
Then look inside the empty tomb!
He is risen! He is risen!
Here there is hope for ev’ry fear!
Here there is joy for ev’ry tear!
O! Let the nations sing the fame
Of Christ the Lamb who once was slain!
He is risen! He is risen!
Now we await the coming day,
When all those raised in Christ will say:

So precious is Jesus, my Savior, my King;
His praise all the day long with rapture I sing.
To Him in my weakness for strength I can cling,
For He is so precious to me.
For He is so precious, so precious to me;
For He is so precious, so precious to me.
’Tis heaven below, my Redeemer to know,
For He is so precious to me.
He stood at my heart’s door ’mid sunshine and rain,
And patiently waited an entrance to gain.
What shame that so long He entreated in vain,
For He is so precious to me.
I stand on the mountain of blessing at last,
No cloud in the heavens a shadow to cast,
His smile is upon me; the valley is past,
For He is so precious to me.
I praise Him because He appointed a place
Where some day, through faith in His wonderful grace,
I know I shall see Him, shall look on His face,
For He is so precious to me.

Come, poor sinner, come to Jesus,
Bring Him all your sin and care;
Though your soul be bowed with anguish,
He will all your trouble share.
He is waiting, He is waiting,
Freely He will all forgive,
He will pardon, He will pardon,
Look to Jesus, look and live.
Though your sins arise like mountains,
Though like crimson they appear,
Through the precious blood of Jesus
They shall be like crystal clear.
Oh, the precious blood that bought you!
Oh, the suff’rings on the tree!
Can you slight His offered mercy,
And His love so pure and free? 
Jesus, pleading, calls the wand’rer,
Stands with outstretched arms to save;
See the wounds received on Calv’ry,
Freely there His life He gave.
Come, then, precious soul, to Jesus,
Hasten now, your sins forsake;
Jesus ready stands to save you,
Come, oh, come before too late.

Dear friends, listen, let me tell you,
If I but could portray
What a vision thrills my being
As I walk on this way:
There before me in such glory,
In such brightness, I see,
Stands a Bridegroom, blessed Bridegroom,
And He’s waiting for me! 
He is waiting, He is waiting
At the end of the way,
“I am coming, I am coming,"
With what joy I do say;
He is waiting, He is waiting
In such splendor, I see—
Hallelujah! for my Bridegroom
Is there waiting for me! 
He is fairer than the lilies,
Brighter far than the sun,
He is chief among ten thousand,
Yes, my heart He has won!
I am wholly His forever,
Yes, through eternity—
For the Bridegroom, yes, my Bridegroom,
Is now waiting for me! 
Care I any if my journey
May now seem rough and long?
Nay—His glory lights my pathway,
And His smile brings a song;
Yes, these clouds and thorns and boulders,
Oh, how small they will be
When I reach my one Beloved,
Who is waiting for me! 
I am coming, I am coming,
I will never say nay,
For His beauty fills my being,
Lost in love, I’ll obey;
What a vision, what a rapture,
What a glory I see—
There before me waits my Bridegroom,
Yes, He’s waiting for me! 

Though I walk in ways unknown,
I am never left alone;
For the Lord will not forsake me while I do His will;
But whatever may betide,
He is walking by my side,
And by this I know He loves me still.
He is with me still,
He is with me still;
In the sunshine or the shadow,
He is with me still.
When the raging storm winds blow,
And the clouds are hanging low,
When the waves are beating on me, and the night is chill;
Then His presence in the storm
Quiets all my soul’s alarm,
And I know that He is with me still.
’Mid the busy cares of life,
In the battle’s raging strife,
When around my soul are gathered all the hosts of ill;
Then a voice so sweet and clear
Whispers words of love and cheer,
And I know that He is with me still.

Shall I tell you what brought me to Jesus,
What caused me to seek His blessed face?
It was this, that, to save and to cleanse me,
He just put Himself in my place.
He just put Himself in my place (O bless His Name!)
He just put Himself in my place (O bless His Name!)
This is the Gospel story,
To Jesus the glory,
He just put Himself in my place.
O, He felt all my load in the garden,
My guilt He did carry on the tree;
I was lost, and condemned unto judgment,
But my Lord Himself died for me.
Soon He’s coming again from the glory,
The prophets of God on this agree;
And till then this to others I’m telling,
That for them He died as for me.

As I walk in pastures green,
By the crystal waters’ sheen,
Jesus gives me from all sorrow and from care release;
As a shepherd doth his sheep,
He my soul doth ever keep,
While I’m trusting I have perfect peace.
Oh, He keepeth me in perfect peace,
Yes, He keepeth me in perfect peace;
While on Him my mind is stayed,
I can never be afraid,
For He keepeth me in perfect peace.
Dwelling in the secret place,
Where I see my Father’s face,
I have found a heav’nly refuge, and my troubles cease;
In the shadow of His wings,
How my happy spirit sings,
For He keepeth me in perfect peace.
From temptation’s trying hour
He will keep me by His pow’r,
If I meekly all the mandates of His law obey;
Since the blessed Savior came,
In my heart with love aflame,
Peace is reigning all along the way.
As the apple of His eye
He will keep me till I die,
For the One who watches o’er me never falls asleep;
He surrounds me like a wall,
Yes, He is my all in all,
And my soul in perfect peace He’ll keep.

I know not what awaits me,
God kindly veils mine eyes,
And o’er each step of my onward way
He makes new scenes to rise;
And every joy He sends me, comes
A sweet and glad surprise.
Where He may lead me I’ll follow,
My trust in Him repose,
And every hour in perfect peace
I’ll sing, He knows, He knows;
And every hour in perfect peace
I’ll sing, He knows, He knows.
One step I see before me,
’Tis all I need to see,
The light of Heav’n more brightly shines,
When earth’s illusions flee;
And sweetly through the silence, came
His loving “Follow Me." 
Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
’Tis blessed not to know;
He holds me with His own right hand,
And will not let me go,
And lulls my troubled soul to rest
In Him Who loves me so.
So on I go not knowing,
I would not if I might;
I’d rather walk in the dark with God
Than go alone in the light;
I’d rather walk in faith with Him
Than go alone by sight.

He knows and He hears
When you cry unto Him,
Though it may be your tears
Make the pathway seem dim.
He knows and He sees
When your soul’s in distress,
And if oft on your knees
With His presence He’ll bless.
He knows and He cares
When you’re troubled and tried,
Though it seems that your prayers
Fall so empty and void.
He knows, yes, He knows,
Why not trust in Him then,
And confide joys and woes
To the Savior of men?

I love to think my Father knows
Why I have missed the path I chose,
And that I soon shall clearly see
The way He led was best for me.
He knows it all, He knows it all,
My Father knows, He knows it all;
Thy bitter tears how fast they fall!
He knows, my Father knows it all.
I love to think my Father knows
The thorns I pluck with every rose
The daily griefs I seek to hide
From the dear souls I walk beside.
I love to think my Father knows
The strength or weakness of my foes,
And that I need but stand and see
Each conflict end in victory.

My Jesus knows when I am Lonely
He knows each pain, He sees each tear
He understands each lonely heartache
He understands because He cares
My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes! He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, He knows just what I need
My Jesus knows when I am burdened
He knows how much my heart can bear
He lifts me up when I am sinking
And brings me joy beyond compare
When other friends seem to forget me
When skies are dark, when hope is gone
By faith I feel His arms around me
And hear Him say, "You're not alone"
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, He knows just what I need

I have a Maker;
He formed my heart.
Before even time began,
My life was in His hand.
He knows my name;
He knows my every thought.
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call.
I have a Father;
He calls me His own.
He’ll never leave me,
No matter where I go.

He leadeth me, O blessed thought!
O words with heav’nly comfort fraught!
Whate’er I do, where’er I be
Still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.
He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful foll’wer I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.
Sometimes ’mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
By waters still, o’er troubled sea,
Still ’tis His hand that leadeth me.
Lord, I would place my hand in Thine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since ’tis my God that leadeth me.
And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the vict’ry’s won,
E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

In loving kindness Jesus came,
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
Thro' grace He lifted me.
From sinking sand, He lifted me,
With tender hand, He lifted me,
From shades of night to planes of light,
O praise His name, He lifted me! 
He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His Word,
Forgiv'n He lifted me.
From sinking sand, He lifted me,
With tender hand, He lifted me,
From shades of night to planes of light,
O praise His name, He lifted me! 
His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief forlorn,
In love He lifted me.
From sinking sand, He lifted me,
With tender hand, He lifted me,
From shades of night to planes of light,
O praise His name, He lifted me!

Christ the Savior came from Heaven’s glory,
To redeem the lost from sin and shame;
On His brow he wore the thorn-crown glory,
And upon Calvary He took my blame.
He lives on high, He lives on high,
Triumphant over sin and all its stain;
He lives on high, He lives on high,
Some day He’s coming again.
He arose from death and all its sorrow,
To dwell in that land of joy and love;
He is coming back some glad tomorrow,
And He’ll take all His children home above.
Weary soul, to Jesus come confessing,
Redemption from sin He offers thee;
Look to Jesus and receive a blessing,
There is life, there is joy and victory! 

He lives! the great Redeemer lives!
What joy the blest assurance gives!
And now, before His Father, God,
Pleads the full merit of His blood,
Pleads the full merit of His blood.
Repeated crimes awake our fears,
And justice armed with frowns appears,
But in the Savior’s lovely face
Sweet mercy smiles, and all is peace,
Sweet mercy smiles, and all is peace.
In every dark, distressful hour,
When sin and Satan join their power,
Let this dear hope repel the dart,
That Jesus bears us on His heart,
That Jesus bears us on His heart.
Great Advocate, almighty Friend!
On Him our humble hopes depend;
Our cause can never, never fail,
For Jesus pleads, and must prevail,
For Jesus pleads, and must prevail.

He liveth long who liveth well;
All other life is short and vain;
He liveth longest who can tell
Of living most for heavenly gain.
He liveth long who liveth well;
All else is being flung away;
He liveth longest who can tell
Of true things truly done each day.
Be what thou seemest; live thy creed;
Hold up to earth the torch divine:
Be what thou prayest to be made;
Let the great Master’s steps be thine.
Fill up each hour with what will last;
Buy up the moments as they go;
The life above, when this is past,
Is the ripe fruit of life below.
Sow love, and taste its fruitage pure;
Sow peace, and reap its harvest bright;
Sow sunbeams on the rock and moor,
And find a harvest-home of light.

On the third day of beginnings as the Father gave command
With all over creation silenced the water gave way to land
It pierced through the waters just as all the other ground
Yet none could have more purpose, no greater will 'ere be found 
While the earth began to settle and He saw that it was good
That Father held His only Son, knowing sure He understood
"This rock of death is part of the journey you must face
Can you withstand the suffering, the pain and the disgrace?" 
He made His own mountain, like no other mountain
He saw the exact place where one day He'd die
With love for His Father and trembling spirit
He went to that mountain and gave up His life 
Then He looked on His creation for through Him it all was made
There He saw it from a distance where the groundwork had been laid
But when time had reached its fullness and He looked down from the cross
It was then He felt the suffering and the pain of all the lost 
So I went to that mountain to see it with my own eyes
The view seen by Jesus, and there I came to realize 
I go to that mountain and give Him my life 

Well I know that God
He promised me
That He would always be there
Though fame and fortune flee
And friends have come and gone
I will not worry for I am not alone
One day my faith grew weak
I stood on a troubled sea
I began to drown but Jesus lifted me
Well He came just in time
And now I’m doing fine
And He never lied to me
He never, He never, He never, no.
He never lied to me (He never, no, He never lied to me)
Oh, my Jesus (He never, no, He never lied to me)
He never lied to me (He never, no, He never lied to me)
He said when you get weary (He never, no, He never lied to me)
Just put your trust in me (He never, no, He never lied to me)
I’ll see you through all eternity (He never, no, He never lied to me)
One day my faith grew weak (He, He, He never lied to me)
I stood on a troubled sea (He never, no, He never lied to me)
I began to drown (He never, no, He never lied to me)
But Jesus lifted me (He never, no, He never lied to me)
He said He’d be my friend
Until the very end
And He never lied to me

They crucified my Lord,
And He never said a mumbalin’ word;
They crucified my Lord,
And He never said a mumbalin’ word.
Not a word, not a word, not a word.
They nailed Him to a tree,
And He never said a mumbalin’ word;
They nailed Him to a tree,
They pierced Him in the side,
And He never said a mumbalin’ word;
They pierced Him in the side,
The blood came trickalin’ down,
And He never said a mumbalin’ word;
The blood came trickalin’ down,
He bowed His head and died,
And He never said a mumbalin’ word;
He bowed His head and died,

He pardoned my transgressions,
He sanctified my soul,
He honors my confessions,
Since by His blood I’m whole.
It is truly wonderful
What the Lord has done!
It is truly wonderful!
It is truly wonderful!
It is truly wonderful
What the Lord has done!
Glory to His Name.
He keeps me ev’ry moment
By trusting in His grace;
’Tis through His best atonement,
That I may see His face.
He brings me through affliction,
He leaves me not alone;
He’s with me in temptation,
He keeps me for His own.
He prospers and protects me,
His blessings ever flow;
He fills me with His glory,
He makes me white as snow.
He keeps me firm and faithful,
His love I do enjoy,
For this I shall be grateful,
And live in His employ.
There’s not a single blessing
Which we receive on earth
That does not come from heaven,
The source of our new birth.

There’s a sweet and blessed story
Of the Christ who came from glory,
Just to rescue me from sin and misery;
He in loving-kindness sought me,
And from sin and shame hath brought me,
Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.
Hallelujah! what a Savior,
Who can take a poor, lost sinner,
Lift him from the miry clay and set me free!
I will ever tell the story,
Shouting glory, glory, glory,
Hallelujah! Jesus lifted me.
From the depth of sin and sadness
To the heights of joy and gladness
Jesus lifted me, in mercy full and free;
With His precious blood He bought me,
When I knew Him not, He sought me,
And in love divine He ransomed me.
From the throne of heav’nly glory—
Oh, the sweet and blessed story!—
Jesus came to lift the lost in sin and woe
Into liberty all-glorious,
Trophies of His grace victorious,
Evermore rejoicing here below.
By and by, with joy increasing,
And with gratitude unceasing,
Lifted up with Christ forevermore to be,
I will join the hosts there singing,
In the anthem ever ringing,
To the King of Love who ransomed me.

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our blessed Lord was slain, the Christ who came to 
reign, and in a grave he lay, to wait the coming day.
He rose triumphantly, in power and majesty,
the Saviour rose no more to die; 
O let us now proclaim the glory of his name, 
and tell to all, he lives today!
They sorrowed when He died, Nor sought the tears to hide
But soon their bitter pain was turned to joy again
The stone was rolled away, For Christ was raised that day
And now He lives above to manifest His love

’Twas Easter Sunday morning,
To the village I had gone;
My boyhood home where lived the ones I loved;
At the church the preacher spoke the Word,
The choir sang sweetly, too,
And in their midst an old man sang
The old songs good and true;
His voice was sweet and tender,
I seem to hear him yet
Sing again an old I never will forget.
How he sang in the old church choir
Olden songs, golden songs of a bygone day,
Sweet songs of gladness, songs, too, of sadness
That carried me far, far away,
And I longed in my soul for that heavenly goal
That he sang of so sweetly in those songs:
“Lead Kindly Light amid th’encircling gloom"
And “Rock of Ages cleft for me."
Those were the songs, the old golden songs
That he sang in the old church choir.
So here’s a simple lesson
Of the good that we can do
To help our fellow men along the way;
Just a word of cheer to those we meet
May ease an aching heart,
A song may save two souls that otherwise might drift apart.
Still in my memr’y that lingers
That singer and his song.
Sweet and low, so long ago,
To hear his voice I long.

He sat to watch o’er customs paid,
A man of scorned and hard’ning trade;
Alike the symbol and the tool
Of foreign masters’ hated rule.
But grace within his breast had stirred;
There needed but the timely word;
It came, true Lord of souls! from Thee,
That royal summons, “Follow Me."
Enough, when Thou wert passing by
To hear Thy voice, to meet Thine eye;
He rose, responsive to the call,
And left his task, his gains, his all.
O wise exchange! with these to part
And lay up treasure in Thy heart;
With twofold crown of light to shine
Amid Thy servants’ foremost line!
Come, Savior, as in days of old;
Pass where the world has strongest hold,
And faithless care and selfish greed
Are thorns that choke the holy seed.
Who keep Thy gifts, O bid them claim
The steward’s, not the owner’s name;
Who yield all up for Thy dear sake,
Let them of Matthew’s wealth partake.

He saved us
Not because of righteous things we’ve done
He saved us
Through the washing of His precious blood
He saved us through the sacrifice of His only Son
Through His mercy we’re saved by love
It is with a grateful heart that I come to you today
It is with humble adoration
That I take this time to say
I know that I’m not all I could be
And I don’t always see
That He’s beside me and to guide me and to comfort me
(He’s guiding me)
If you’ve got a troubled mind
And you can find no rest
If you’ve been worried ‘bout the future
And you wonder if you’re blessed
I know that He’s got all that I need
And He can always see
When I am falling I can call and He will rescue me
(He’ll rescue me)
We’re saved by love, we’re saved by lov.

I’ve found the Savior who died for man,
He saves to the uttermost;
I’ve proved redemption a perfect plan,
He saves to the uttermost.
He saves to the uttermost,
He saves to the uttermost;
He’s the only One in whom I can boast,
He saves to the uttermost.
I sought and tasted His pard’ning love,
He saves to the uttermost;
And streams of glory came from above,
He saves to the uttermost.
He cleansed my spirit from inbred sin,
He saves to the uttermost;
And now the Comforter dwells within,
He saves to the uttermost.
Though far you’ve wandered away from God,
He saves to the uttermost;
His grace He offers—a ceaseless flood,
He saves to the uttermost.

My soul is filled with joy and gladness
Since Jesus came to me.
His love has banished all my sadness,
From sin I am set free.
He set me free, He set me free,
I was blind, but hallelujah, now I see!
I shall ne’er forget the day
When He washed my sins away,
And He set, He set me free.
The Comforter divine is dwelling
Within my soul today;
His love to others I am telling
Since Jesus came to stay.
The grace of Jesus hath abounded
For all my sins I see,
Salvation walls have me surrounded,
From sin I am set free.

He shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Almighty God
He shall be called Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace
His name is Jesus, for He will save His people from sin
His name Immanuel, God with man
Jesus is called Wonderful Counselor, Almighty God
Jesus is called Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace
His name is Jesus, for He saves His people from sin
His name Immanuel, God with man
His name Immanuel, God with man
We praise Your name Wonderful Counselor, 
Almighty God
We praise Your name Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace
We love You Jesus, for You save Your people from sin
We love You Immanuel, God with man
We love You Immanuel, God with man

“He shall feed His flock like a shepherd,
He shall gather the lambs with His arm."
In His bosom they shall be ever
Safely shielded from all harm.
He shall gather the lambs,
Shall gather the lambs with His arm of love;
He shall gather the lambs,
Shall gather the lambs with His arm.
“He shall feed His flock like a shepherd":
Oh, how precious the promise to me!
Shepherd kind, how blest the assurance
That the lambs are dear to Thee.
“He shall feed His flock like a shepherd":
Oh, the depth of His wonderful love!
Lead us, guide us, wonderful Shepherd,
Safe into Thy fold above.

Nineteen hundred million souls,
Standing near the final goal,
Soon we’ll see the awful judgment on them fall;
Must they truly be consigned
To the pit, and there confined,
Since the blessed Savior shed His blood for all? 
Every second, sad to tell,
Counts another soul in hell,
Dreadful sight to see them bound in sin’s dark pall;
What in life we all may do,
Can but save a very few,
Yet the blessed Savior shed His blood for all.
Though a million be brought in,
There’s a billion yet in sin,
Quickly bear the gospel message unto all;
Preach the word at any cost,
For the world in sin is lost,
Yet the blessed Savior shed His blood for all.
Can we tarry home for dross,
While beholding such a loss?
If we can, from heaven’s grace we’ll surely fall;
Quickly leave thy cottage door,
Spread the truth from shore to shore,
For the blessed Savior shed His blood for all.

He shows me everything (everything)
That I can be (can be)
And with His loving hand (And with His loving hand)
He strengthens me (He strengthens me) Ooh.
When everything's wrong, He seems to make it alright
He shows me everything I can be
When I'm at my weakest, He gives strength for the fight
He shows me everything I can be
Ooh.
He shows me everything I can be 
When life is a struggle, He says all is not lost
He shows me everything I can be
When I look away, He points me back to the cross
He shows me everything I can be
Ooh.
He shows me everything I can be 
He paid the price, a sacrifice
For every sinner like me
He gave a light, that shines so bright
To show me everything I can be
Ooh.
He shows me everything I can be 
When everything's chaos, He restores peace and calm
He shows me everything I can be
When I start to fall, He lets me lean on His arm
He shows me everything I can be
Ooh.
He shows me everything I can be 
On my own I cannot see
All He wants me to be
With the faith that He's given to me
Now I know I'm totally free, ooh.
When I try to earn it, He reminds me it's grace
He shows me everything I can be
When I'm full of pride, He puts me back in my place
He shows me everything I can be
Ooh.
He shows me everything I can be 
He shows me everything (everything)
That I can be

He stood before the court
on trial instead of us;
he met its power to hurt,
condemned to face the cross:
our king, accused
of treachery;
our God, abused
for blasphemy!
These are the crimes that tell
the tale of human guilt;
our sins, our death, our hell
on these the case is built:
to this world's powers
their Lord stays dumb;
the guilt is ours,
no answers come.
Te sentence must be passed,
the unknown prisoner killed;
the price is paid at last,
the law of God fulfilled:
he takes our blame,
and from that day
the accuser's claim
is wiped away.
Shall we be judged and tried?
In Christ our trial is done;
we live, for he has died,
our condemnation gone:
in Christ are we
both dead and raised,
alive and free
his name be praised!

All of my need He freely supplieth,
Day after day His goodness I prove;
Mercies unfailing, new every morning,
Tell me of God’s unchangeable love.
God hath laid help on One that is mighty,
One who is Friend and Brother indeed;
Nothing have I, yet I am contented,
For He supplieth all of my need.
All of my need He freely supplieth,
Wisdom and guidance, strength as my day;
Grace for each trial, comfort in sorrow,
Blessed communion all of the way.
All of my need He freely supplieth,
There’s not a void that He cannot feel;
Never a burden He cannot lighten,
Never a heartache He cannot heal.
All of my need He freely supplieth,
I shall not want, whatever betide;
He that delivered Christ for my ransom,
With Him will all things surely provide.

He that believes and is baptized
Shall see the Lord’s salvation;
Baptized into the death of Christ,
He is a new creation.
Through Christ’s redemption he shall stand
Among the glorious heavenly band
Of every tribe and nation.
With one accord, O God, we pray:
Grant us Thy Holy Spirit;
Look Thou on our infirmity
Through Jesus’ blood and merit.
Grant us to grow in grace each day
That by this sacrament we
Eternal life inherit.

He that goeth forth with weeping,
Bearing precious seed in love,
Never tiring, never sleeping,
Findeth mercy from above.
Soft descend the dews of heaven,
Bright the rays celestial shine;
Precious fruits will thus be given
Through an influence all divine.
Sow thy seed; be never weary;
Let no fears thy soul annoy;
Be the prospect ne’er so dreary,
Thou shalt reap the fruits of joy.
Lo! the scene of verdure brightening,
See the rising grain appear:
Look again; the fields are whitening,
For the harvest time is near.

He that is down needs fear no fall,
he that is low no pride;
he that is humble ever shall
have God to be his guide.
I am content with what I have,
little be it or much;
and, Lord, contentment still I crave,
because thou savest such.
Fullness to such a burden is
that go on pilgrimage;
here little, and hereafter bliss,
is best from age to age.

Love divine, so great and wondrous,
Deep and mighty, pure, sublime!
Coming from the heart of Jesus,
Just the same through tests of time.
He the pearly gates will open,
So that I may enter in;
For He purchased my redemption
And forgave me all my sin.
Like a dove when hunted, frightened,
As a wounded fawn was I;
Brokenhearted, yet He healed me,
He will heed the sinner’s cry.
Love divine, so great and wondrous,
All my sins He then forgave!
I will sing His praise forever,
For His blood, His power to save.
In life’s eventide, at twilight,
At His door I’ll knock and wait;
By the precious love of Jesus
I shall enter Heaven’s gate.

He took my feet from the miry clay,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!
And placed them on the rock to stay,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!
I can tell the world about this,
I can tell the nations I’m blest,
Tell them that Jesus made me whole,
And He brought joy, joy to my soul!
O my Lord did just what He said,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!
He healed the sick and He raised the dead,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!
O Jesus washed my sins away,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!
And made me happy all the day,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!
He died on the cross to save my soul,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!
He ransomed me and made me whole,
Yes, He did! Yes, He did!

I came to Jesus, weary, worn, and sad.
He took my sins away, He took my sins away.
And now His love has made my heart so glad,
He took my sins away.
He took my sins away, He took my sins away,
And keeps me singing every day!
I'm so glad He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
The load of sin was more than I could bear.
He took my sins away, He took my sins away.
And now on Him I roll my ev池y care,
He took my sins away.
No condemnation have I in my heart,
He took my sins away, He took my sins away.
His perfect peace He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.
If you will come to Jesus Christ today,
He'll take your sins away, He'll take your sins away,
And keep you happy in His love each day,
He'll take your sins away.

Shackled by a heavy burden,
'neath a load of guilt and shame;
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.
He touched me, O, He touched me,
And O, the joy that floods my soul.
Something happened, and now I know,
He touched me and made me whole.
Since I met this blessed Savior,
Since He cleansed and made me whole;
I will never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls.

To the feet of my Savior in trembling and fear,
A penitent sinner I came;
He saw, and in mercy, He bade me draw near;
All glory and praise to His Name.
He touched me and thus made me whole;
Bringing comfort and rest to my soul;
O glad happy day, all my sins rolled away!
For He touched me and thus made me whole.
I knew not the tender compassion and love
That Jesus, my Savior, had shown;
Tho’ burdened with grief, His dear hand brought relief,
He healed me and called me His own.
“My grace is sufficient," I heard His dear voice,
“O come and find rest for your soul;
From sin you to save, My life freely I gave;
I died that you might be made whole."
O Jesus, dear Jesus, Thy Name I adore,
For saving and keeping my soul;
Thy praises I’ll sing, my Redeemer and King,
Thy dear, loving hand made me whole.

He walks among the golden lamps
on feet like burnished bronze:
his hair as snows of winter white,
his eyes with fire aflame, and bright
his glorious robe of seamless light
surpassing Solomon's.
And in his hand the seven stars,
and from his mouth a sword:
his voice the thunder of the seas;
all creatures bow to his decrees
who holds the everlasting keys
and reigns as sovereign Lord.
More radiant that the sun at noon,
who was, and is to be:
who was, from everlasting days;
who lives, the Lord of all our ways--
to him be majesty and praise
for all eternity.

He wants a poor sinner like me.
He wants a poor sinner like me,
Oh, wonderful love, can it be!
Christ shed His own blood to redeem me,
He wants a poor sinner like me.
When I see Him beneath the cross bending,
When I hear the sharp nails His flesh rending,
When I see His blood flow,
Jesus loves me I know,
He wants a poor sinner like me.
Yes, He wants all the sinful, the grieving,
His dear arms are held out for receiving.
I no longer will stay from this Savior away,
He wants a poor sinner like me.
Yes, He wants by His hand now to hold me,
And with His mighty love to enfold me;
Yes, He wants me to stay in His presence alway,
He wants a poor sinner like me.

have heard a most wonderful story
Of the Son of the Highest in glory,
How my heart He doth seek, though so sinful, so weak,
God has sent the Holy Spirit
To our hearts an honored guest,
To deliver us from evil,
And to bring us peace and rest;
He has come to work within us
Heaven’s purposes so blest:
He wants His way in thee.
Yield unto the Holy Spirit,
Let Him have His way in thee;
Be thou ready to obey Him,
He leads to victory.
Let the Spirit do the planning,
Point the way thy feet shall go;
Greater than thine own His wisdom,
He the will of God doth know;
Better, wiser than thy choosing
Is the way that He will show:
He wants His way in thee.
He doth sometimes work in silence,
When thou dost not know at all;
He doth sometimes speak so softly
Thou must listen for His call;
But if thou wilt trust Him fully,
He will be thine all in all:
He wants His way in thee.
All thyself to Him surrender,
As He pleases let Him do;
In the paths He leadeth, follow,
Whether they be old or new;
When the tasks seem hard before thee,
He with power will endue:
He wants His way in thee.

He wants not friends that hath Thy love,
And may converse and walk with Thee;
And with Thy saints here and above,
With whom forever I must be.
In the communion of the saints
Is wisdom, safety and delight;
And, when my heart declines and faints,
It’s raised by their heat and light.
As for my friends, they are not lost;
The several vessels of Thy fleet,
Though parted now, by tempests tossed,
Shall safely in the haven meet.
Still we are centered all in Thee,
Members, though distant, of one head;
In the same family we be,
By the same faith and Spirit led.
Before Thy throne we daily meet
As joint petitioners to Thee;
In spirit we each other greet,
And shall again each other see.
The heav’nly hosts, world without end,
Shall be my company above;
And Thou, my best and surest Friend,
Who shall divide me from Thy love?

What a wonderful, wonderful Savior,
Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His precious lifeblood,
That the sinner might be made free.
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.
Thus He left His heavenly glory,
To accomplish His Father’s plan;
He was born of the virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.
He was wounded for our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He’s the Healer of ev’ry sickness,
This He came to the world to do.
So He gave His life for others
In Redeeming this world from sin,
And He’s gone to prepare a mansion,
That at last we may enter in.

“He was not willing that any should perish";
Jesus enthroned in the glory above,
Saw our poor fallen world, pitied our sorrows,
Poured out His life for us, wonderful love!
Perishing, perishing! Thronging our pathway,
Hearts break with burdens too heavy to bear:
Jesus would save, but there’s no one to tell them,
No one to lift them from sin and despair.
“He was not willing that any should perish";
Clothed in our flesh with its sorrow and pain,
Came He to seek the lost, comfort the mourner,
Heal the heart broken by sorrow and shame.
Perishing, perishing! Harvest is passing,
Reapers are few and the night draweth near:
Jesus is calling thee, haste to the reaping,
Thou shalt have souls, precious souls for thy hire.
Plenty for pleasure, but little for Jesus;
Time for the world with its troubles and toys,
No time for Jesus’ work, feeding the hungry,
Lifting lost souls to eternity’s joys.
Perishing, perishing! Hark, how they call us;
Bring us your Savior, oh, tell us of Him!
We are so weary, so heavily laden,
And with long weeping our eyes have grown dim.
“He was not willing that any should perish";
Am I His follower, and can I live
Longer at ease with a soul going downward,
Lost for the lack of the help I might give!
Perishing, perishing! Thou wast not willing;
Master, forgive, and inspire us anew;
Banish our worldliness, help us to ever
Live with eternity’s values in view.

He was there all the Time
Time after time I was searching
For peace in some void
I was trying to blame all my ills
On this world I was in
Surface relationships used me
Til I was done in
But all the time someone was waiting
To free me from my sin
He was there all the time
He was there all the time
Waiting patiently in line
He was there all the time
Never again will I look
For a fake rainbow's end
Now that I have the answer for my life
It's just starting to mend
And living each new day with Him
Is a breath of fresh life
And oh what I've missed
He was there patiently waiting in line
He was there all the time 

I have read in His word how the blessed Savior came
To this world, and He died on the tree;
There my Savior and Lord, yes, my Prophet, Priest, and King—
He was bruised and was wounded for me.
He was wounded for me, He was wounded for me,
Christ the Savior was wounded for me;
For my sins and transgressions, O my Lord, this my plea,
That Jesus, my Savior, was wounded for me.
Oh, my soul, stand in awe, see what anguish He has borne,
In the garden alone, all for thee;
There was nothing of earth for thy sins that could atone,
Then He died, yes, He died there for me.
Now I bow at His feet, and the story I repeat,
Of His love that has reached even me;
I will praise His great name, and shall never cease to sing,
That my Savior was wounded for me.

’Tis so sweet just to know that along the way
Jesus walks by my side all the livelong day,
And He knows when the shadows begin to low’r,
And He whispers His love to me o’er and o’er.
He whispers His love to me,
He whispers His love to me;
Lest I should stray from Him away,
He whispers His love to me.
When He scatters the gifts from His boundless store,
And His showers of blessing around me pour,
Lest I humble and grateful forget to be,
Jesus whispers His wonderful love to me.
When my heart is so tempted and sorely tried,
It is then that I know He is by my side,
And I know He will give me the victory,
As He whispers His wonderful love to me.
Oh, His voice is so wondrously sweet to me!
There’s no music on earth has such melody;
There’s no joy that can come to the human heart
Like the joy that His love ever doth impart.

Sometime when misgivings darken the day
And faith's light I cannot see
I ask my dear Lord to brighten the way
He whispers sweet peace to me (to me)
He whispers sweet peace to me (yes He whispers to me)
He whispers sweet peace to me (He whispers sweet peace to me)
When I am cast down in spirit and soul
He whispers sweet peace to me (to me)
He speaks through His word, assurance He gives
I'm His and I know He's mine
And safe in the fold my soul He will keep
I'll rest in His love divine (divine)

He who began a good work in you
He who began a good work in you
Will be faithful to complete it
He’ll be faithful to complete it
He who started the work
Will be faithful to complete it in you
The struggle you’re facing is slowly
Replacing your hope with despair
For the process is long
And you’re losing your song in the night
You can be sure that the Lord
Has His hand on you, safe and secure
He will never abandon you
You are His treasure
And He finds His pleasure in yoh

He Who once in righteous vengeance
Whelmed the world beneath the flood,
Once again in mercy cleansed it
With His own most precious blood,
Coming from His throne on high
On the painful cross to die.
O the wisdom of th’Eternal!
O the depth of love divine!
O the sweetness of that mercy
Which in Jesus Christ did shine!
We were sinners doomed to die;
Jesus paid the penalty.
When before the Judge we tremble,
Conscious of His broken laws,
May the blood of His atonement
Cry aloud, and plead our cause,
Bid our guilty terrors cease,
Be our pardon and our peace.
Prince and Author of salvation,
Lord of Majesty supreme,
Jesu, praise to Thee be given
By the world Thou didst redeem;
Glory to the Father be
And the Spirit One with Thee.

He Who suns and worlds upholdeth
Lends us His upholding hand;
He the ages Who unfoldeth
Doth our times and ways command.
God is for us, God is for us;
In His strength and stay we stand.
He Who sage and seer instructed
Will not keep from us His lore;
Who those ancient saints conducted
Hath not giv’n His guiding o’er.
God is for us, God is for us;
Helpful now as heretofore.
’Gainst oppression forth He sends us;
His the cause of truth and right;
With His own great host He binds us,
Lendeth us of His own might;
God is for us, God is for us;
Brings to happy end the fight.
Onward, upward doth He beckon;
Onward, upward would we press;
As His own our burdens reckon,
As our own His strength possess.
God is for us, God is for us;
God, our Helper, still we bless.

He who to Jesus manfully bore witness,
He whom God's people join to-day to honour,
Now in the hidden mansions of the blessed
Bideth for ever.
With store of virtues God adorned his spirit,
Guiding his willing feet in paths of goodness,
Through all the earthly years while in his body
Mortal breath tarried.
Wherefore with voices linked in happy 
Hymn we his praises on this holy feast-day,
Praying for grace to follow in his footsteps
Now and hereafter.
Glory and honour, power and salvation
Be unto him, who, throned in the highest,
Ordereth meetly earth and sky and ocean,
Triune, eternal.

He who would valiant be ’gainst all disaster,
Let him in constancy follow the Master.
There’s no discouragement shall make him once relent
His first avowed intent to be a pilgrim.
Who so beset him round with dismal stories
Do but themselves confound—his strength the more is.
No foes shall stay his might; though he with giants fight,
He will make good his right to be a pilgrim.
Since, Lord, Thou dost defend us with Thy Spirit,
We know we at the end, shall life inherit.
Then fancies flee away! I’ll fear not what men say,
I’ll labor night and day to be a pilgrim.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The original text from Pilgrim’s Progress:
Who would true valour see,
Let him come hither;
One here will constant be,
Come wind, come weather
There’s no discouragement
Shall make him once relent
His first avowed intent
To be a pilgrim.
Whoso beset him round
With dismal stories
Do but themselves confound;
His strength the more is.
No lion can him fright,
He’ll with a giant fight,
He will have a right
To be a pilgrim.
Hobgoblin nor foul fiend
Can daunt his spirit,
He knows he at the end
Shall life inherit.
Then fancies fly away,
He’ll fear not what men say,
He’ll labor night and day
To be a pilgrim.

He, whose confession God of old accepted,
Whom through the ages all now hold in honor,
Gaining his guerdon this day came to enter
Heaven’s high portal.
God-fearing, watchful, pure of mind and body,
Holy and humble, thus did all men find him,
While, through his members, to the life immortal
Mortal life called him.
Thus to the weary, from the life enshrined,
Potent in virtue, flowed humane compassion;
Sick and sore laden, howsoever burdened,
There they found healing.
So now in , giving God the glory,
Raise we our anthem gladly to his honor,
That in fair kinship we may all be sharers
Here and hereafter.
Honor and glory, power and salvation,
Be in the highest unto Him Who reigneth
Changeless in Heaven over earthly changes
Triune, eternal.

God has given you His promise
That He hears and answers prayer.
He will heed your supplication
If you cast on Him your care.
He will answer every prayer,
He will answer every prayer,
Go to Him in faith believing,
He will answer every prayer.
He will not withhold one blessing,
He will give you what is best.
God will answer by His Spirit,
Every one who makes request.
He can hear the great petition,
And the smallest, over there.
Unto God pray without ceasing,
He will answer every prayer.
Take to God your plans and failures,
Any time and anywhere.
No one ever goes unanswered,
For He answers every prayer.

He will be raised up, lifted up, highly exalted
Raised up, lifted up, highly exalted
Raised up, lifted up, highly exalted
Jesus, Jesus my Lord 
We're raising the Father, (we raise You) the creator of life
We're lifting the Father, (we lift You) with our soul and our mind
Exalting the Father, (we exalt You) all the glory deserved
We're praising the Father, with our lives we will serve 
We're raising the Savior, (we raise You) our Messiah and King
We're lifting the Savior, (we lift You) and His praises we sing
Exalting the Savior, (we exalt You) to His throne up on high
We're praising the Savior, 'til we meet Him in the sky 
We're raising the Spirit, (we raise You) blessed comforter divine
We're lifting the Spirit, (we lift You) holy, tender, and kind
Exalting the Spirit, (we exalt You) as He lives in our heart
We're praising the Spirit, and we never will depart 
Oh, Jesus, Jesus my Lord (my Lord)
Jesus, Jesus my Lord (Jesus)
Jesus, Jesus my Lord 

I walk today in the Christian way,
Though dangers I may see;
I will not fear for the Lord is near,
And He will care for me.
No matter what happens, He will care for me;
He will care for me, He will care for me.
And His mighty hand will enable me to stand,
No matter what happens to me.
No test I face but sufficient grace
Is ready for my need;
When sorrows rise to obscure my skies,
He proves a friend indeed.
He will not fail in the strongest gale
That stormy winds can blow;
And in His grace is a hiding place
Unknown to any foe.
I trust in Him though disasters grim
Before me seem to be;
He calms my fears, and He dries my tears,
And faithful is to me.

He will come and save you, He will come and save you
Say to the weary one, "Your God will surely come"
He will come and save you
He will come and save you, He will come and save you
Lift up your eyes to Him, you will arise again
He will come and save you 
Say to those who are fearful hearted, (don't be afraid) "Do not be afraid" 
(don't be afraid)
The Lord your God is strong and with His mighty arm
When you call on His name, He will come and save 
Say to those who are broken hearted, (don't lose your faith) "Do not lose your 
faith" (don't lose your faith)
The Lord your God is strong and with His loving arm
When you call on His name, He will come and save 
Lift up your eyes to Him, you will arise again
He will come and save you 

When the storms of life are raging,
Tempests wild on sea and land,
I will seek a place of refuge
In the shadow of God’s hand.
He will hide me, He will hide me,
Where no harm can e’er betide me;
He will hide me, safely hide me,
In the shadow of His hand.
Though He may send some affliction,
’Twill but make me long for home;
For in love and not in anger,
All His chastenings will come.
Enemies may strive to injure,
Satan all his arts employ;
He will turn what seems to harm me
Into everlasting joy.
So while here the cross I’m bearing,
Meeting storms and billows wild,
Jesus for my soul is caring,
Naught can harm His Father’s child.

When I fear my faith will fail,
Christ will hold me fast;
When the tempter would prevail,
He can hold me fast.
He will hold me fast,
He will hold me fast;
For my Savior loves me so,
He will hold me fast.
I could never keep my hold,
He will hold me fast;
For my love is often cold,
He must hold me fast.
I am precious in His sight,
He will hold me fast;
Those He saves are His delight.
He will hold me fast.
He’ll not let my soul be lost,
Christ will hold me fast;
Bought by Him at such a cost,
He will hold me fast.

We read and heard a story from the Blessed Old Book
How the walls of Jericho the people marched around
And when that trumpet sounded, how the mighty walls shook
Walls around the city came a-tumblin down 
The Lord delivered Daniel from the hungry lions' den
He rolled the waters back before old Moses and his men
He led the people out of Egypt's bondage and it's sin
The Lord, He calmed the ocean and the mighty winds that blew
He saved the Hebrew children from the fiery furnace, too
He rose up from the grave just like the prophets said He'd do
Never will forsake us, matter not what may come
Safely He will lead His faithful children on home 
The Lord said, "Brother Jonah, go to Ninevah land"
But he disobeyed the Lord by hidin' away
Then Jonah got converted to obey the command
From the whale the Lord delivered him on that day 
The Lord has raised the dead and caused the blind men to see
He cleansed the lepers spots and turned the water to wine
The Lord's the same today and now forever will be
There's no other power like the Savior Divine 

My faith temptation shall not move,
For Jesus knows it all,
And holds me with His arm of love—
He will not let me fall.
He will not let me fall,
He will not let me fall,
He is my Strength, my Hope, my All,
He will not let me fall.
When grief is more than I can bear—
To weak am I to call—
If I but lift my heart in prayer,
He will not let me fall.
Sometimes I falter, filled with fear,
I cannot see at all,
His voice I never fail to hear—
“I will not let thee fall."

Though I walk in ways unknown,
I am never left alone;
For the Lord will not forsake me while I do His will;
But whatever may betide,
He is walking by my side,
And by this I know He loves me still.
He is with me still,
He is with me still;
In the sunshine or the shadow,
He is with me still.
When the raging storm winds blow,
And the clouds are hanging low,
When the waves are beating on me, and the night is chill;
Then His presence in the storm
Quiets all my soul’s alarm,
And I know that He is with me still.
’Mid the busy cares of life,
In the battle’s raging strife,
When around my soul are gathered all the hosts of ill;
Then a voice so sweet and clear
Whispers words of love and cheer,
And I know that He is with me still.

We come to a moment so great in our lives,
We look at each other, with tears in our eyes,
So thankful to God for this moment in time,
But He had it planned long ago.
He holds the heavens in space, the world in its place;
The mountains and valleys are all His, we know.
A man and a woman, a love that's forever, yes,
He had it planned long ago.
Today there's the question: "How long will it last,
How soon will the joy of this moment be past?"
The answer is, "Never" if we really know
That He had it planned long ago.
He holds the heavens in space, the world in its place;
The mountains and valleys are all His, we know.
A man and a woman, a love that's forever, yes,
He had it planned long ago.
There's nobody greater that God up above,
He'll keep us together with His great arms of love.
And we'll never be lonely on earth, here below,
For He had it planned long ago.
He holds the heavens in space, the world in its place;
The mountains and valleys are all His, we know.
A man and a woman, a love that's forever, yes,
He had it planned long ago.
He holds the heavens in space, the world in its place;
The mountains and valleys are all His, we know.
A man and a woman, a love that's forever, yes,
He had it planned long ago.
Oh yes, He had it planned long ago.

Who is moving on the waters
Who is holding up the moon 
Who is peeling back the darkness
With the burning light of noon
Who is standing on the mountains
Who is on the earth below
Who is bigger than the heavens
And the lover of my soul
Creator God, He is Yahweh
The Great I Am, He is Yahweh
The Lord of All, He is Yahweh
Rose of Sharon, He is Yahweh
The Righteous Son, He is Yahweh
The Three-in-one, He is Yahweh
Who is He that makes me happy
Who is He that gives me peace
Who is He that brings me comfort
And turns the bitter into sweet
Who is stirring up my passion
Who is rising up in me
Who is filling up my hunger
With everything I need
You are holy and eternal
And forever You will reign
Every knee will bow before You 
Every tongue will confess your name
All the angels give you glory
As they stand before Your throne
And here on Earth we gather
To declare Your name alon.

He leads us on by paths we did not know;
Upward He leads us, tho’ our steps be slow;
Tho’ oft we faint and falter on the way,
Tho’ storms and darkness oft obscure the day,
Yet when the clouds are gone,
We know He leads us on.
He leads us on thro’ all th’unquiet years;
Past all our dreamland hopes, and doubts, and fears
He guides our steps; thro’ all the tangled maze
Of losses, sorrows, and o’erclouded days
We know His will is done,
And still He leads us on.
And He, at last—after the weary strife,
After the restless fever we call life,
After the dreariness, the aching pain,
The wayward struggles which have proved in vain,
After our toils are past—
Will give us rest at last.

In loving kindness Jesus came,
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
Thro' grace He lifted me.
From sinking sand, He lifted me,
With tender hand, He lifted me,
From shades of night to planes of light,
O praise His name, He lifted me! 
He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His Word,
Forgiv'n He lifted me.
From sinking sand, He lifted me,
With tender hand, He lifted me,
From shades of night to planes of light,
O praise His name, He lifted me! 
His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief forlorn,
In love He lifted me.
From sinking sand, He lifted me,
With tender hand, He lifted me,
From shades of night to planes of light,
O praise His name, He lifted me!

Have you heard the wondrous story
Of the victory for God,
How the Lord of life and glory,
Sin beneath His feet hath trod?
Sing it out, oh, sing it ever,
Till the hills take up the strain,
And the saints beyond the river—
Join to sing, “He lives again!"
Have you heard the wondrous story
Of a wide and open grave,
Out of which the Lord of glory
Hath come forth with power to save?
Have you heard the wondrous story
Of the captive souls set free
By the Lord of life and glory,
Who hath brought them liberty?
May I tell the wondrous story,
For I know its worth so well,
How the Lord of life and glory,
Saved my soul from death and hell?

Oh, bless the Lord, He cleansed my soul,
And filled my lips with singing;
He came in my poor, sinful heart,
And set the joy-bells ringing.
Oh, praise the Lord, He first loved me;
I feel new life upspringing;
He came in my poor, sinful heart,
And set the joy-bells ringing.
He placed my feet upon the Rock,
The only sure foundation;
He shows me wonders of His grace,
The blessings of salvation.
His promise is “for all the days,"
His love for me is caring;
While in the “Father’s House" above,
A mansion He’s preparing.
His love is calling, seeking still,
Come, every burden bringing;
The touch of Christ within your heart
Will set the joy-bells ringing.

Blessed is the service of our Lord and King,
Precious are the jewels we may help to bring;
Down the passing ages words of counsel ring:
He that winneth souls is wise.
He that winneth souls is wise;
In the home beyond the skies,
There's a crown of glory,
O the wondrous prize!
He that winneth souls is wise.
In the quiet homelife, showing love's bright ray,
More and more like Jesus living ev'ry day,
We may guide a dear one to the heav'nward way:
He that winneth souls is wise.
Out upon the highway, going forth with prayer,
For the lost and straying seeking ev'rywhere,
Close beside the Shepherd, we His joy may share:
He that winneth souls is wise.
Sow beside all waters, sow the gospel seed,
Here a word in season, there a loving deed;
Sinners to the Saviour be it ours to lead:
He that winneth souls is wise.

A trembling soul, I sought the Lord,
My sin confessed, my guilt deplored;
How soft and sweet His word to me:
"I took thy place and died for thee."
No other hope, no other plea:
He took my place and died for me.
O precious Lamb of Calvary!
He took my place and died for me.
Here rests my heart; assurance sweet,
His blessed work He will complete,
Since in His love so great and free
He took my place and died for me.
When sorrow veils the smiling day,
When evil foes beset my way,
Abundant grace in Him I see;
He took my place and died for me.
No room for doubt, no room for fears,
When to my view the cross appears;
My joyful song shall ever be:
He took my place and died for me.

Hark how th'adoring hosts above
With songs surround the throne,
With songs surround the throne!
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues;
But all their hearts are one,
But all their hearts are one,
But all their hearts are one.
Worthy the Lamb that died, they cry,
To be exalted thus,
To be exalted thus;
Worthy the Lamb, our hearts reply,
For He was slain for us,
For He was slain for us,
For He was slain for us.
Thou hast redeemed us with Thy blood,
And set the pris'ners free,
And set the pris'ners free;
Thou mad'st us kings and priests to God,
And we shall reign with Thee,
And we shall reign with Thee,
And we shall reign with Thee.
To Him who sits upon the throne,
The God whom we adore,
The God whom we adore,
And to the Lamb that once was slain,
Be glory evermore,
Be glory evermore,
Be glory evermore.

Time after time I was searching for peace in some void
I was trying to blame all my ills on this world I was in
Surface relationships used me till I was done in
But all the while someone was begging to free me from sin 
He was there all the time
He was there all the time
Waiting patiently in line
He was there all the time 
Never again will I search for a fake rainbows end
Now that I’ve found the answer my life is just starting to rhyme
Sharing each new day with Him is a breath of fresh life
Oh what I've missed He's been waiting right here all the time 
He was there all the time
He was there all the time
Waiting patiently in line
He was there all the time

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He bore our sins in His body on the tree;
For our guilt He gave us peace,
From our bondage gave release,
And with His stripes,
and with His stripes,
And with His stripes our souls are healed.
He was numbered among transgressors,
We did esteem Him forsaken by His God;
As our sacrifice He died,
That the law be satisfied,
And all our sin,
and all our sin,
And all our sin was laid on Him.
We had wandered, we all had wandered
Far from the fold of "the Shepherd of the sheep";
But He sought us where we were,
On the mountains bleak and bare,
And bro't us home,
and bro't us home,
And bro't us safely home to God.
Who can number His generation?
Who shall declare all the triumphs of His Cross?
Millions, dead, now live again,
Myriads follow in His train!
Victorious Lord,
victorious Lord,
Victorious Lord and coming King! 

Head of Thy Church triumphant,
We joyfully adore Thee;
Till Thou appear, Thy members here
Shall sing like those in glory.
We lift our hearts and voices
With blest anticipation,
And cry aloud, and give to God
The praise of our salvation.
While in affliction’s furnace,
And passing through the fire,
Thy love we praise, which knows our days,
And ever brings us nigher.
We clap our hands exulting
In Thine almighty favor;
The love divine which made us Thine
Shall keep us Thine for ever.
Thou dost conduct Thy people
Through torrents of temptation,
Nor will we fear, while Thou art near,
The fire of tribulation.
The world with sin and Satan
In vain our march opposes,
Through Thee we shall break through them all,
And sing the song of Moses.
By faith we see the glory
To which Thou shalt restore us,
The cross despise for that high prize
Which Thou hast set before us.
And if Thou count us worthy,
We each, as dying Stephen,
Shall see Thee stand at God’s right hand,
To take us up to Heaven.

Head of Thy church, whose Spirit fills
And flows through every faithful soul,
Unites in mystic love, and seals
Them one, and sanctifies the whole;
“Come, Lord," Thy glorious Spirit cries,
And souls beneath the altar groan;
“Come, Lord," the bride on earth replies,
“And perfect all our souls in one."
Pour out the promised gift on all,
Answer the universal “Come!"
The fullness of the Gentiles call,
And take thine ancient people home.
To Thee let all the nations flow,
Let all obey the Gospel word;
Let all their bleeding Savior know,
Filled with the glory of the Lord.
O for Thy truth and mercy’s sake
The purchase of Thy passion claim!
Thine heritage the Gentiles take,
And cause the world to know Thy Name.

Heal me, O my Savior, heal;
heal me, as I suppliant kneel;
heal me and my pardon seal.
Fresh the wounds that sin hath made;
hear the prayers I oft have prayed,
and in mercy send me aid.
Helpless, none can help me now;
cheerless, none can cheer but thou;
suppliant, Lord, to thee I bow.
Thou the true Physician art;
thou, O Christ, canst health impart,
binding up the bleeding heart.
Other comforters are gone;
thou canst heal and thou alone,
thou for all my sin atone.
Heal me then, my Savior, heal;
heal me, as I suppliant kneel;
to thy mercy I appeal.

Hear our prayer, O heavenly Father,
ere we lay us down to sleep;
may thine angels, pure and holy,
round our bed their vigil keep.
Heavy though our sins, thy mercy
far outweighs them every one;
down before the cross we cast them,
trusting in thy help alone.
None can measure out thy patience
by the span of human thought;
none can bound the tender mercies
which thy holy Son has bought.
Pardon all our past transgressions,
give us strength for days to come;
guide and guard us with thy blessing
till thine angels bear us home.
Honor, glory, might, dominion,
to the Father and the Son,
with the everlasting Spirit,
while eternal ages run.

Heal us, Emmanuel, hear our prayer
[originally, Heal us, Emmanuel, here we are]
We wait to feel Thy touch;
Deep wounded souls to Thee repair,
And Savior, we are such.
Our faith is feeble, we confess
We faintly trust Thy Word;
But wilt Thou pity us the less?
Be that far from Thee, Lord!
Remember him who once applied
With trembling for relief
“Lord, I believe," with tears he cried;
“O help my unbelief!"
She, too, who touched Thee in the press
And healing virtue stole,
Was answered, “Daughter, go in peace;
Thy faith has made thee whole."
Concealed amid the gathering throng,
She would have shunned Thy view;
And if her faith was firm and strong,
Had strong misgivings too.
Like her, with hopes and fears we come
To touch Thee if we may;
O send us not despairing home;
Send none unhealed away.

There is healing at the fountain,
Come and find it, weary soul,
There your sins may all be covered;
Jesus waits to make you whole.
Oh the fountain! blessed healing fountain!
I am glad ’tis flowing free;
Oh the fountain! precious, cleansing fountain!
Praise the Lord, it cleanseth me.
There is healing at the fountain,
Look to Jesus now and live,
At the cross lay down thy burden;
All thy wanderings He’ll forgive.
There is healing at the fountain,
Precious fountain filled with blood;
Come, oh come, the Savior calls you,
Come and plunge beneath its flood.

There are some disappointments, there are times when we weep,
When those we love dearly have wounded us deep;
But there’s healing in Jesus, there’s a balm for each pain,
And the heart that’s been wounded can be made whole again.
Yes, there’s healing in Jesus, there’s a balm for each pain,
And the heart that’s been broken can be made whole again.
There are homes that are broken, there are hearts that are sore,
There are ties that are severed to unite nevermore;
But there’s healing in Jesus, there’s a balm for each pain,
And the heart that’s been broken can be made whole again.
There are sins that have blackened both the heart and the name,
And stricken a mother with sorrow and shame;
But there’s healing in Jesus, there’s a balm for each pain,
And the heart that’s been blackened can be made white again.
Is it true when we’ve fallen into pitfalls of sin
We must always be crippled, never soar high again?
No, there’s healing in Jesus, there’s a balm for each pain,
And the wing that’s been broken can now soar high again.
There’s a mother that’s troubled with the cares of the home,
And wond’ring if ever a bright day will come;
But there’s healing in Jesus, there’s a balm for each pain,
And the heart that is heavy can be made light again.

Healing in your wings, O Lord
Healing in your wings, Oh there is.
Healing in your wings O, Lord
Healing in your wings, Oh there is.
There is one thing you have spoken,
Two things I have heard
That you my God are loving
And my loving God is strong, and there is.

I am praying, blessed Savior,
To be more and more like Thee;
I am praying that Thy Spirit
Like a dove may rest on me.
Thou Who knowest all my weakness,
Thou Who knowest all my care,
While I plead each precious promise,
Hear, oh, hear and answer prayer.
I am praying, blessed Savior,
For a faith so clear and bright
That its eye will see Thy glory
Through the deepest, darkest night.
I am praying to be humbled
By the power of grace divine,
To be clothed upon with meekness,
And to have no will but Thine.
I am praying, blessed Savior,
And my constant prayer shall be
For a perfect consecration,
That shall make me more like Thee.

O weary heart, why seek in vain
The balm of rest from earth to gain,
While Jesus waits, your King to reign,
And all your sins forgive!
Awake, arise! no more delay;
He calls you now—His voice obey!
The loving words He speaks today,
Oh hear, and you shall live!
He calls again; on Him believe,
His gift of grace thro’ faith receive;
Your truest Friend no longer grieve,
But haste your heart to give.
To Jesus come, and at His feet
That precious Name with praise repeat;
Oh, trust Him now, and learn how sweet
The peace His love will give.

Heart and mind, possessions, Lord,
I offer unto Thee;
All these were Thine, Lord;
Thou didst give them all to me.
Wondrous are Thy doings unto me.
Plans and my thoughts and everything I ever do
Are dependent on Thy will and love alone.
I commit my spirit unto Thee.
Heart and mind, possessions, Lord,
I offer unto Thee;
Thou art the Way, the Truth;
Thou art the Life.
Sinful, I commit myself unto Thee.
Jesus Christ is filling all the heart of me.
He can give me victory o’er all that threatens me.
Jesus Christ is filling all my heart.

Here I am
In Your sanctuary
Here I am
In Your holy presence
To hear You 
My Lord, my Lord!
Here I am
Lord of lords
Here I am
In Your holy presence
For the love of You
My Lord, my Lord!
For You are the assurance
Of my future
You are my fortress
The Rock of my salvation
You are my strength
And my refuge
Here I am!

Hear, Lord, the voice of my complaint,
Preserve my life from fear;
Hide me from plotting enemies
And evil, crowding near.
The workers of iniquity,
Their deadly shafts prepare;
They aim at me their treacherous words;
O save me from their snare.
The wicked in their base designs
Grow arrogant and bold;
Conspiring secretly, they think
That God will not behold;
They search out more iniquity,
Their thoughts and plans are deep,
But God will smite, for He is near
His saints to guard and keep.
The wicked, by their sins o’ercome,
Shall soon be brought to shame;
The hand of God shall yet appear,
And all shall fear His Name.
The just shall triumph in the Lord,
Their trust shall be secure,
And endless glory then shall crown
The upright and the pure.

O heav’nly Father, hear my supplication,
I bow before Thee in Thy congregation;
Humble and needy, seeking Thy salvation,
Hear Thou my prayer, O God!
Draw me, Redeemer, I would seek Thee solely,
Help me to cherish, love, obey Thee wholly,
Fully surrendered, live a life that’s holy,
Hear Thou my prayer, O God!
Dwell Thou, O Savior, in my heart forever,
Thou who hast promised nothing shall us sever,
Comfort and lead me, I would leave Thee never,
Hear Thou my prayer, O God.

Light of all who come to Thee,
Let me now Thy glory see,
Shining down with beams divine,
Making glad this heart of mine.
Hear my call, oh, hear my call,
Thou my Life, my all in all;
By Thy hand uphold me still,
With Thy love my spirit fill.
Hope of all who trust in Thee,
Thou Whose blood was shed for me,
Thro’ its healing power divine
Keep from sin this heart of mine.
In Thy strength, and not my own,
This I ask before Thy throne,
Blessed Lord, my faith increase,
Keep my soul in perfect peace.
When on earth I close mine eyes,
When to life Thou bidst me rise,
To Thyself, Thou Friend divine,
Take, oh, take this heart of mine.

Hear my words, O gracious Lord,
To my thoughts attentive be;
Hear my cry, my King, my God,
I will make my prayer to Thee.
With the morning light, O Lord,
Thou shalt hear my voice arise,
And expectant I will bring
Prayer as morning sacrifice.
Thou art holy, O my God,
Thou delightest not in sin;
Evil shall not dwell with Thee,
Nor the proud Thy favor win.
In the fullness of Thy grace
To Thy house I will repair;
Bowing toward Thy holy place,
Lost in love I worship there.

soul, men languish.Hellish the sword now brandished
piercing human minds.Comes now the Lord of healing
Touched with our deepest feeling; Truth from His
lips is pealing, freeing humankind.

trusting in thy help alone.
None can measure out thy patience
by the span of human thought;
none can bound the tender mercies
which thy holy Son has bought.
Pardon all our past transgressions,
give us strength for days to come;
guide and guard us with thy blessing
till thine angels bear us home.
Honor, glory, might, dominion,
to the Father and the Son,
with the everlasting Spirit,
while eternal ages run.

Hear sweet voices from above,
Fill thy hands and go with love,
To the weary as they wait, so late;
In the name of Christ your King,
Go and sweetly, sweetly sing,
Go and wipe their tears away, and pray.
Happy voices ev’rywhere
Are like angels in the air.
’Twas for this that Jesus came,
There is music in His Name,
In the work He calleth you, be true.
Cups of water ye may bear,
And bring answer to your prayer;
Jesus led the multitude with good.
How the blind with opened eyes
Looked on Him with glad surprise!
Love may fix the eyes long dim on Him.
Only tell the story how
Jesus comes to bless you now;
What you do for love is best confessed.
Go as Jesus went to them;
You may find perchance a gem,
Long to sparkle in His sight in light.

Hear the blessed Savior calling the oppressed,
“O ye heavy laden, come to Me and rest.
Come, no longer tarry, I your load will bear,
Bring Me every burden, bring Me every care."
Come unto Me, I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you, hear Me and be blessed.
I am meek and lowly, come and trust My might.
Come, My yoke is easy, and My burden’s light.
Are you disappointed, wandering here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus—He will give you rest.
Stumbling on the mountains dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling toward the pit of hell’s consuming flame.
By the powers of sin deluded and oppressed,
Hear the tender Shepherd, “Come to Me and rest."
Have you by temptation often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, if you’ll claim His best.
In the Holy Spirit, He will give you rest.

Lo! the day of God is breaking;
See the gleaming from afar!
Sons of earth from slumber waking,
Hail the Bright and Morning Star.
Hear the call! O gird your armor on,
Grasp the Spirit’s mighty sword:
Take the helmet of salvation,
Pressing on to battle for the Lord!
Trust in Him Who is your Captain;
Let no heart in terror quail;
Jesus leads the gath’ring legions,
In His Name we shall prevail.
Onward marching, firm and steady,
Faint not, fear not Satan’s frown,
For the Lord is with you always,
Till you wear the victor’s crown.
Conq’ring hosts with banners waving,
Sweeping on o’er hill and plain,
Ne’er shall halt till swells the anthem,
“Christ o’er all the world doth reign!"

Hear the chiming Easter bells,
Their joyous music ringing;
Hear the children’s happy voices,
Easter carols singing.
Ringing, ringing, singing, singing,
Easter bells and happy voices;
Christ arose on Easter day,
And all the world rejoices,
And all the world rejoices.
Angels came from Heav’n above
To tell the wondrous story:
“Christ is risen from the dead,
The Lord of life and glory."
“Seek Him not among the dead,
The grave is not His prison;
Go and His disciples tell,
That Christ the Lord is risen."
Christ the Lord is ris’n today,
Salvation to us bringing;
Easter bells, ring out your chimes,
While voices glad are singing.

O’er the ocean’s rolling waters,
From an eastern land today,
Comes a cry from heathen daughters,
“Save us ere we’re lost for aye";
Loud we hear their voices crying,
Borne upon each floating breeze,
For their souls in sin are dying,
While we idly wait at ease.
Who will go, oh, who will go,
Bear the message o’er the sea?
Oh, who will go? 
Home and friends to us seem nearer,
As we hear their pleading cry;
Native land seems even dearer—
Still in tears they moan and sigh;
“Will not someone leave his nation?
You are saved, but we are lost!"
Jesus died for all creation—
Who will come at any cost? 
“Though your home and friends you cherish,
Will you not regard the cries
From the lips of those who perish,
As they rend the vaulted skies;
Many come with sect confusion,
Who themselves are in the night,
Bringing only more delusion;
Who will bring the gospel light?" 
Go, my brother, o’er the ocean,
Leave behind all earthly dross;
Prove to God thy life’s devotion,
Lift the banner of His cross;
Jesus left His home in glory,
Died to set the captives free;
Go and tell the wondrous story,
Bear the message o’er the sea.

Hear the everlasting song,
Breaking thro’ the sky:
“Glory, glory be to God,
To God on high!"
Thro’ the blessed courts of light
Saints and angels, joyful singing,
Strike their harps and shout aloud,
“The Lord is King!"
Hear the loud triumphant song,
O’er the world resound:
Like a mighty ocean rolls
The glad, glad sound:
“Hallelujah! praise the Lord!"
Distant climes His triumph singing,
Lift their voice and shout aloud,
“The Lord is King!"
Praise the blessed Three in One,
All ye heav’nly host:
Praise the Father, praise the Son,
And Holy Ghost!
As it was in all the past,
Through eternal ages ringing,
Ransomed ones shall still proclaim,
“The Lord is King!"

Sinners, will you scorn the message
Sent in mercy from above?
Every sentence, O how tender!
Every line is full of love:
Listen to it, listen to it,
Every line is full of love.
Hear the heralds of the Gospel
News from Zion’s King proclaim:
“Pardon to each rebel sinner,
Free forgiveness in His Name":
How important, how important,
“Free forgiveness in His Name."
Tempted souls, they bring you succor;
Fearful hearts, they quell your fears,
And, with news of consolation,
Chase away the falling tears:
Tender heralds, tender heralds,
Chase away the falling tears.
O ye angels, hovering round us,
Waiting spirits, speed your way;
Haste ye to the court of heaven,
Tidings bear without delay,
Rebel sinners, rebel sinners,
Glad the message will obey.

Hear the wail across the sea
Comes from millions unto thee—
Weary ones who might be free
Did they but know of Calvary.
Wailing, wailing o’er the sea;
Wailing, wailing unto thee;
Wailing, wailing to be free;
Go, tell them all of Calvary.
Wailing of the prophet cursed,
Of fanatics, wildest, worst,
Help us, Lord, their chains to burst,
And set them free by Calvary.
Wailings reach this favored shore,
Wailings ceasing nevermore;
Men are dying evermore;
Go, tell them all of Calvary.

Hear this, all ye people, hear,
Earth’s inhabitants, give ear;
All of high and low degree,
Rich and poor, give heed to me.
Truth with all my heart I seek,
And my mouth shall wisdom speak;
Hearken while in lyric strain
I make hidden wisdom plain.
Why should I to fear give way
When I see the evil day,
When with wickedness my foes
Shall surround me and oppose?
They that trust in treasured gold,
Though they boast of wealth untold,
None can bid his brother live,
None to God a ransom give.
If from death one would be free
And corruption never see,
Costly is life’s ransom price,
Far beyond all sacrifice.

Hear us, Heav’nly Father,
Thou Whose gentle care
Tends the young and feeble,
Hear our simple prayer!
Hear our prayer!
Father, hear!
Pardon our offenses,
Guard us from all ill;
Make us, like true children,
Love Thy holy will.
Hear our prayer!
Father, hear!
Let not sin beguile us
From Thy paths to stay;
But with Thy great mercy
Keep us night and day.
Hear our prayer!
Father, hear!

Hear us, O Lord, from Heaven Thy dwelling place:
Like them of old, in vain we toil all night,
Unless with us Thou go, Who art the Light,
Come then, O Lord, that we may see Thy face.
Thou, Lord, doest rule the raging of the sea,
When loud the storm and furious is the gale:
Strong is Thine arm; our little barques are frail:
Send us Thy help; remember Galilee.
Our wives and children we commend to Thee:
For them we plough the land and plough the deep;
For them by day the golden corn we reap,
By night the silver harvest of the sea.
We thank Thee, Lord, for sunshine, dew and rain,
Broadcast from heaven by Thine almighty hand—
Source of all life, unnumbered as the sand—
Bird, beast, and fish, herb, fruit and golden grain.
O Bread of Life, Thou in Thy Word hast said,
Who feeds in faith on Me shall never die!
In mercy hear Thy hungry children’s cry—
Father, give us this day our daily bread!
Sow in our hearts the seeds of Thy dear love,
That we may reap contentment, joy, and peace;
And when at last our earthly labors cease,
Grant us to join Thy harvest home above.

Hear us, O Savior, when we pray,
Humbly our need confessing;
Grant us the promised show’rs today—
Send them upon us, O Lord!
Send show’rs of blessing;
Send show’rs refreshing;
Send showers of blessing;
Send them, Lord, we pray!
Knowing Thy love, on Thee we call,
Boldly Thy throne addressing;
Pleading that show’rs of grace may fall—
Send them upon us, O Lord!
Trusting Thy Word that cannot fail,
Master we claim Thy promise;
Oh that our faith may now prevail—
Send us the showers, O Lord!

Hear what glorious song of angels
Is now ringing through the air;
Never valley, never mountain
Heard an anthem half so fair.
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Is the jubilant ;
God is sending us a Savior,
Peace on earth, good will to man.
Messengers of God’s free mercy
Are now seen by human eye;
Shepherds hear the wondrous message:
“Glory be to God on high."
Let us also sing the praises
Of our God so full of love,
Who on Christmas sent a Savior,
Sent a Savior from above.

Hear what God the Lord hath spoken,
“O my people, faint and few,
Comfortless, afflicted, broken,
Fair abodes I build for you:
Themes of heartfelt tribulation
Shall no more perplex your ways;
You shall name your walls, Salvation,
And your gates shall all be praise.
“There, like streams that feed the garden,
Pleasures, without end, shall flow,
For the Lord, your faith rewarding,
All His bounty shall bestow;
Still in undisturbed possession
Peace and righteousness shall reign;
Never shall you feel oppression,
Hear the voice of war again.
“Ye no more your suns descending,
Waning moons no more shall see;
But your griefs forever ending,
Find eternal noon in Me:
God shall rise, and shining o’er you,
Change to day the gloom of night;
He, the Lord, shall be your Glory,
God your everlasting Light."

Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims
for all the pious dead;
sweet is the savor of their names,
and soft their sleeping bed.
They die in Jesus and are blest;
how kind their slumbers are;
from sufferings and from sins released,
and freed from every snare.
Far from this world of toil and strife,
they're present with the Lord;
the labors of their mortal life
end in a large reward.

Hear ye the Master’s call, “Give Me thy best!"
For, be it great or small, that is His test.
Do then the best you can, not for reward,
Not for the praise of men, but for the Lord.
Every work for Jesus will be blest,
But He asks from everyone his best.
Our talents may be few, these may be small,
But unto Him is due our best, our all.
Wait not for men to laud, heed not their slight;
Winning the smile of God brings its delight!
Aiding the good and true ne’er goes unblest,
All that we think or do, be it the best.
Night soon comes on apace, day hastens by;
Workman and work must face testing on high.
Oh, may we in that day find rest, sweet rest,
Which God has promised those who do their best.

O weary heart, why seek in vain
The balm of rest from earth to gain,
While Jesus waits, your King to reign,
And all your sins forgive!
Awake, arise! no more delay;
He calls you now—His voice obey!
The loving words He speaks today,
Oh hear, and you shall live!
He calls again; on Him believe,
His gift of grace thro’ faith receive;
Your truest Friend no longer grieve,
But haste your heart to give.
To Jesus come, and at His feet
That precious Name with praise repeat;
Oh, trust Him now, and learn how sweet
The peace His love will give.

Hear, Lord, the voice of my complaint,
Preserve my life from fear;
Hide me from plotting enemies
And evil, crowding near.
The workers of iniquity,
Their deadly shafts prepare;
They aim at me their treacherous words;
O save me from their snare.
The wicked in their base designs
Grow arrogant and bold;
Conspiring secretly, they think
That God will not behold;
They search out more iniquity,
Their thoughts and plans are deep,
But God will smite, for He is near
His saints to guard and keep.
The wicked, by their sins o’ercome,
Shall soon be brought to shame;
The hand of God shall yet appear,
And all shall fear His Name.
The just shall triumph in the Lord,
Their trust shall be secure,
And endless glory then shall crown
The upright and the pure.

We are your people 
Called by your Name 
We humble ourselves and pray 
We are your people 
Called by your Name 
We humble ourselves and pray 
We turn from our sin 
And come to seek your face 
Hear from heaven 
And forgive our wicked ways 
Hear from heaven 
And heal our land today

Come, for all is ready, and the feast is spread,
Come, for Jesus offers you the living Bread,
Hear His invitation, ’mid the toil and strife,
Come, and take the gift of life.
Hear the word,
All may come,
Without price,
Come and take eternal life.
Gospel bells are ringing, hear the echo sweet,
Calling in the wand’ring to the Savior’s feet,
Heed the tender message, seek the great reward,
Hear the voice of Christ your Lord.
Welcome, ever welcome to the feast of love,
Whosoever will, may see His face above,
Hark, with hallelujahs, how the high courts ring,
Come, and crown the Savior King.
You who know how precious is His grace so free,
Take the gift of life yet more abundantly.
Spread the invitation, there is room for all,
Sound abroad the loving call.

Hearken, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we have sinned against thee.
To thee, Redeemer, King of highest heaven,
Lift we our eyes in grief and deep abasement:
Listen, O Saviour, to our supplications.
Head of the Corner, right hand of the Father,
Way of salvation, gate of life eternal,
Wash thou away the stain of our offences.
Lord, we beseech thee, from thy throne of glory
Bow down thine ear to hear our cry of sorrow,
Look down in mercy on our sore transgressions.
All our misdoings now we lay before thee,
Unveil with contrite heart each guilty secret:
Saviour, in pity grant us thy forgiveness.
Guiltless, a captive taken unresisting,
By false accusers brought to condemnation,
Save, Lord, and help the souls thou hast redeemed.

Hearken to the solemn voice, the awful midnight cry;
Waiting souls, rejoice, rejoice, and see the Bridegroom nigh;
Lo! He comes to keep His Word, light and joy His looks impart;
Go ye forth to meet your Lord, and meet Him in your heart.
Ye who faint beneath the load of sin, your heads lift up;
See your great redeeming God, He comes, and bids you hope:
In the midnight of your grief, Jesus doth His mourners cheer;
Lo! He brings you sure relief; believe, and feel Him here.
Ye whose loins are girt, stand forth! Whose lamps are burning bright,
Worthy, in your Savior’s worth, to walk with Him in white:
Jesus bids your hearts be clean, bids you all His promise prove;
Jesus comes to cast out sin, and perfect you in love.
Wait we all in patient hope, till Christ, the Judge, shall come,
We shall soon be all caught up to meet the general doom:
In an hour to us unknown, as a thief in deepest night,
Christ shall suddenly come down, with all His saints in light.
Happy he whom Christ shall find watching to see Him come;
Him the Judge of all mankind shall bear triumphant home:
Who can answer to His Word? Which of you dares meet His day?
“Rise, and come to judgment!"—Lord, we rise, and come away.

Hearken, all! what holy singing
Now is sounding from the sky!
’Tis a hymn with grandeur ringing,
Sung by voices clear and high.
Gloria in excelsis Deo,
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
On the plain, the simple shepherds
Watched their flocks the long night through;
From on high they heard the voices,
Sounding through the heavenly blue.
See, within the manger lowly,
Wide the Christ Child spreads His arms.
Raise to Him your joyful voices,
Sing we all Noel, Noel.

Heart and mind, possessions, Lord,
I offer unto Thee;
All these were Thine, Lord;
Thou didst give them all to me.
Wondrous are Thy doings unto me.
Plans and my thoughts and everything I ever do
Are dependent on Thy will and love alone.
I commit my spirit unto Thee.
Heart and mind, possessions, Lord,
I offer unto Thee;
Thou art the Way, the Truth;
Thou art the Life.
Sinful, I commit myself unto Thee.
Jesus Christ is filling all the heart of me.
He can give me victory o’er all that threatens me.
Jesus Christ is filling all my heart.

Life on earth is all a warfare,
Foes within and foes without,
Jesus! Jesus, lo! the tempter
Flees before that battle shout;
In the fierce unceasing combats,
Let our tranquil warcry be.
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee,
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee.
All, yes, all, I would not pilfer
From my holocaust apart,
Ev'ry thought, word, deed and feeling,
Ev'ry beating of my heart,
Thine till death, and Thine forever,
My heart's cry in heav'n shall be.
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee,
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee.
This will nerve the arm that's weary,
This will dry the tear that steals,
This will soothe the wasting anguish
That the heart in secret feels.
Ever in my soul 'twill slumber,
Often to my lips 'twill start,
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee,
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee.
All things, all things, hard and easy,
High and low, and bright and dark,
Naught too poor for me to offer,
Not to small for Thee to mark,
Health and sickness, rest and labor,
Joy's keen thrill, and grief's keen smart,
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee,
Omnia pro Te Cor Jesu,
Heart of Jesus, all for Thee.

Heart of Jesus meek and mild,
Hear, oh hear thy feeble child,
When the tempest's most severe,
Heart of Jesus hear.
Sweetly we'll rest on thy Sacred Heart,
Never from Thee, oh, let us part,
Hear then thy loving children's pray'r,
Heart of Jesus hear.
Make me Jesus wholly thine,
Change this wayward heart of mine,
Lead me through this world so drear,
Heart of Jesus hear!
Sweetly we'll rest on thy Sacred Heart,
Never from Thee, oh, let us part,
Hear then thy loving children's pray'r,
Heart of Jesus hear.
When I draw my latest breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
Then sweet Jesus be Thou near,
Heart of Jesus hear!
Sweetly we'll rest on thy Sacred Heart,
Never from Thee, oh, let us part,
Hear then thy loving children's pray'r,
Heart of Jesus hear.

When the music fades
And all is stripped away and I simply come
Longing just to bring something that's of worth
That will bless your heart
I'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself
Is not what you have required.You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear.You're looking into my heart
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you, all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about you, all about you, Jesus
King of endless worth, no one could express
How much you deserve.Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours, every single breath
Album: I Could Sing of Your Love Forever

Alleluia, alleluia! Hearts to Heaven and voices raise:
Sing to God a hymn of gladness, sing to God a hymn of praise.
He, who on the cross a Victim, for the world’s salvation bled,
Jesus Christ, the King of glory, now is risen from the dead.
Now the iron bars are broken, Christ from death to life is born,
Glorious life, and life immortal, on the holy Easter morn.
Christ has triumphed, and we conquer by His mighty enterprise:
We with Him to life eternal by His resurrection rise.
Christ is risen, Christ, the first fruits of the holy harvest field,
Which will all its full abundance at His second coming yield:
Then the golden ears of harvest will their heads before Him wave,
Ripened by His glorious sunshine from the furrows of the grave.
Christ is risen, we are risen! Shed upon us heavenly grace,
Rain and dew and gleams of glory from the brightness of Thy face;
That we, with our hearts in Heaven, here on earth may fruitful be,
And by angel hands be gathered, and be ever, Lord, with Thee.
Alleluia, alleluia! Glory be to God on high;
Alleluia! to the Savior who has gained the victory;
Alleluia! to the Spirit, fount of love and sanctity:
Alleluia, alleluia! to the Triune Majesty.

Heaven and earth, and sea and air,
All their Maker’s praise declare;
Wake, my soul, awake and sing:
Now thy grateful praises bring.
See the glorious orb of day
Breaking through the clouds his way;
Moon and stars with silvery light
Praise Him through the silent night.
See how He hath everywhere
Made this earth so rich and fair;
Hill and vale and fruitful land,
All things living, show His hand.
Lord, great wonders workest Thou!
To Thy sway all creatures bow;
Write Thou deeply in my heart
What I am, and what Thou art.

Oh, what a wonderful wonderful day
Day I will never forget
After I wandered in darkness away
Jesus my savior I met
O what a tender compassionate friend,
He met the need of my heart,
Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart.
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul
When at the cross the Savior made me whole
My sins He washed away, and my night He turned to day,
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

Heaven is here, where hymns of gladness
Cheer the toilers’ rugged way,
In this world where clouds of sadness
Often change to night our day;
Heaven is here, where misery lightened
Of its heavy load is seen,
Where the face of sorrow brightened,
By the deed of love hath been.
Where the sad, the poor, despairing,
Are uplifted, cheered, and blest,
Where in others’ labors sharing,
We can find our surest rest;
Where we heed the voice of duty,
Tread the path that Jesus trod;
This is Heaven, its peace, its beauty,
Radiant with the love of God.

Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart
Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart 
(Everybody sing) Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart
(Can't you feel it?) Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart 
The kingdom of our Lord is here
Heaven is in my heart
The presence of his majesty
Heaven is in my heart 
(C'mon and sing along) Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart
(Do you believe it?) Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart 
In His presence joy abounds
Heaven is in my heart
The light of Holiness surrounds
Heaven is in my heart 
(I like to sing it) Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart
(Do you believe it?) Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart 
We are a temple of the Lord
Heaven is in my heart
We worship Him in one accord
Heaven is in my heart 
Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart (in my heart)
(Can't you feel it in my heart?) Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart 
(Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?) Ooooo.Heaven 
is in my heart (in my heart)
Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart 
Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart (in my heart)
(Can you feel it, can you feel it, can't you feel it in my heart?) Ooooo.Heaven 
is in my heart 
Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart (in my heart)
Ooooo.Heaven is in my heart 

When I think about my troubles and my trials in life's way (they can't be right)
The darkness of this world just can't be right
There's a new day coming closer with each day
A new land's within my sight 
I know that my sins are all forgiven (I know they are forgiven)
I know that He watches o'er my life (I know He watches o'er my life)
But when I think of being alone it makes me want to go (when I think of, it 
makes me want to)
To the place that's free from grief and strife (free from strife) 
Heaven's gonna be (Heaven will be), gonna be my home
From my God I nevermore will roam (roam)
(Walking with Him) Walking with Him (I'll never) I'll never be alone
(Whenever) Heaven will be my home 
When I come to the ending of this journey here on earth (a crown of life)
A promised crown of life is my reward
There's a city promised from my second birth
I'm going to meet my Lord 
I know that my life on earth on is passing (I know that my life is passing)
I know that my visit here is brief (I know that visit here is brief)
But when I think of living with Him my heart begins to yearn (when I think of 
living with Him)
For the place of comfort and relief (relief, relief) 
Heaven's gonna be (Heaven will be), gonna be my home
From my God I nevermore will roam (roam)
(Walking with Him) Walking with Him (I'll never) I'll never be alone
(Whenever) 

Listen to the heav'nly music
Made by those who never tire,
Wondrous song that has no ending,
Sung by all the angel choir.
They are singing, ever singing,
Over on the other shore;
Soon we'll join them in the ,
When this fleeting life is o弾r.
Soon we'll join the choir of glory,
Soon we'll greet those gone before;
Yes, we'll meet departed loved ones,
Meet where parting is no more.
There we'll sing, our sorrow over,
On that fair and happy shore,
Where the wicked cease from troubling,
And the weary sigh no more.

Heavenly Father, bless me now;
At the cross of Christ I bow;
Take my guilt and grief away;
Hear and heal me now, I pray.
Now, O Lord, this very hour,
Send Thy grace and show Thy power;
While I rest upon Thy Word;
Come, and bless me now, O Lord.
Mercy now, O Lord, I plead
In this hour of utter need;
Turn me not away unblest;
Calm my anguish into rest.
O Thou loving, blessed One,
Rising o’er me like the sun,
Light and life art Thou within;
Savior, Thou, from every sin!

Heav’nly Father, send Thy blessing
On Thy children gathered here,
May they all, Thy Name confessing,
Be to Thee forever dear;
May they be, like Joseph, loving,
Dutiful, and chaste, and pure;
And their faith, like David, proving,
Steadfast unto death endure.
Holy Savior, Who in meekness
Didst vouchsafe a Child to be,
Guide their steps, and help their weakness,
Bless and make them like to Thee;
Bear Thy lambs, when they are weary,
In Thine arms and at Thy breast;
Through life’s desert, dry and dreary,
Bring them to Thy heav’nly rest.
Spread Thy golden pinions o’er them,
Holy Spirit, from above,
Guide them, lead them, go before them,
Give them peace, and joy, and love;
Thy true temples, Holy Spirit,
May they with Thy glory shine,
And immortal bliss inherit,
And forevermore be Thine.

Heavenly Father, sovereign Lord,
Ever faithful to Thy word,
Humbly we our seal set to,
Testify that Thou art true.
Lo! for us the wilds are glad,
All in cheerful green arrayed,
Opening sweets they all disclose,
Bud and blossom as the rose.
Hark! the wastes have found a voice,
Lonely deserts now rejoice,
Gladsome hallelujahs sing,
All around with praises ring.
Lo! abundantly they bloom,
Lebanon is hither come,
Carmel’s stores the heavens dispense,
Sharon’s fertile excellence.
See, these barren souls of ours
Bloom, and put forth fruits and flowers,
Flowers of Eden, fruits of grace,
Peace, and joy, and righteousness.
We behold (the abjects we!)
Christ, the incarnate Deity,
Christ, in whom Thy glories shine,
Excellence of strength divine.
Ye that tremble at his frown,
He shall lift your hands cast down;
Christ, who all your weakness sees,
He shall prop your feeble knees.
Ye of fearful hearts, be strong;
Jesus will not tarry long;
Fear not lest his truth should fail,
Jesus is unchangeable.
God, your God, shall surely come,
Quell your foes, and seal their doom,
He shall come and save you too;
We, O Lord, have found thee true!
Blind we were, but now we see,
Deal; we hearken now to thee,
Dumb, for thee our tongues employ,
Lame, and, lo! we leap for joy.
Faint we were, and parched with drought,
Water at Thy word gushed out,
Streams of grace our thirst repress,
Starting from the wilderness;
Still we gasp Thy grace to know,
Here for ever let it flow,
Make the thirsty land a pool;
Fix the Spirit in our soul.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version by Benjamin Williams, alt.
Heavenly Father, sovereign Lord,
Be Thy glorious Name adored!
Lord, Thy mercies never fail;
Hail, celestial Goodness, hail!
Though unworthy of Thine ear,
Deign our humble songs to hear;
Purer praise we hope to bring,
When around Thy throne we sing.
While on earth ordained to stay,
Guide our footsteps in Thy way,
Till we come to dwell with Thee,
Till we all Thy glory see.
When, with angel harps again,
We will wake a nobler strain;
There, in joyful songs of praise,
Our triumphant songs we raise.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original version (omitting repetitions):
Grateful notes and numbers bring;
While Jehovah’s praise we sing:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord!
Be Thy glorious name adored.
Men on earth, and saints above,
Sing the great Redeemer’s love:
Lord, Thy mercies never fail!
Hail, celestial goodness, hail!
Though unworthy, Lord, Thine ear,
Our humble hallelujahs hear;
Purer praise hope to bring
When with saints we stand and sing.
Lead us to that blissful state,
Where Thou reignest supremely great;
Look with pity from Thy throne,
And send Thy Holy Spirit down.
While on earth ordained to stay
Guide our footsteps in Thy way;
Till we come to reign with Thee,
And all Thy glorious greatness see.
Then with angels we’ll again
Wake a louder, louder strain;
There, in joyful songs of praise,
We’ll our grateful voices raise.
There no tongue shall silent be:
There all shall join sweet harmony.

Heavenly Father, we beseech Thee,
Grant Thy blessing ere we part;
Take us in Thy care and keeping,
Guard from evil every heart.
Bless the words we here have spoken,
Offered prayer and cheerful strain;
If Thy will, O Lord, we pray Thee,
Grant we all may meet again.
Loving Savior, go Thou with us,
Be our Comfort and our Stay;
Grateful praise to Thee we render
For the joy we feel today.
Holy Spirit, dwell within us,
May our souls Thy temple be;
May we tread the path to glory,
Led and guided still by Thee.
Heavenly Father, loving Savior,
Holy Spirit, Three in One,
As among Thy saints and angels,
So on earth Thy will be done.

Heav’nly Father, we Thy children,
Gathered round our risen Lord,
Lift our hearts in earnest pleading:
Oh, revive us by Thy Word!
Send refreshing, send refreshing,
From Thy presence, gracious Lord!
Send refreshing, send refreshing,
And revive us by Thy Word!
Gracious gales of heav’nly blessing
In Thy love to us afford;
Let us feel Thy Spirit’s presence,
Oh, revive us by Thy Word!
Weak and weary in the conflict,
“Wrestling not with flesh and blood,"
Help us, Lord, as faint we falter,
Oh, revive us by Thy Word!
With Thy strength, O Master, gird us;
Be our Guide, and be our Guard:
Fill us with Thy Holy Spirit;
Oh, revive us by Thy Word!

Heavenly Father, I appreciate You,
Heavenly Father, I appreciate You,
I love You, adore You,
I bow down before You,
Heavenly Father, I appreciate You.
Son of God, what a wonder You are,
Son of God, what a wonder You are.
You cleansed my soul from sin,
You set the Holy Ghost within,
Son of God, what a wonder You are.
Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are,
Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are.
You lead us, You guide us,
You live right inside us,
Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are.

Shadows of night (shadows of night) are gathering above (are gathering above)
There is a pad (there is a pad), I know we'll deliver (I know we'll deliver)
Heavenly love (heavenly love), heavenly love (heavenly love)

Walking in sunlight all of my journey;
Over the mountains, through the deep vale;
Jesus has said, 的'll never forsake thee,"
Promise divine that never can fail.
Heavenly sunlight, heavenly sunlight,
Flooding my soul with glory divine:
Hallelujah, I am rejoicing,
Singing His praises, Jesus is mine.
Shadows around me, shadows above me,
Never conceal my Savior and Guide;
He is the Light, in Him is no darkness;
Ever I'm walking close to His side.
In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing,
Pressing my way to mansions above;
Singing His praises gladly I'm walking,
Walking in sunlight, sunlight of love.

Feet that have carried the gospel glad,
Tidings of peace as the Savior said;
Hands that have strengthened the weak and sad,
Will be waiting there.
Those beautiful portals will open wide,
Open wide, open wide;
Those beautiful portals will open wide
To welcome thee.
Feet that have traveled the narrow way,
Faltering not in the battle fray,
Treading the thorns in the heat of day,
Will be waiting there.
Hands that were folded before thy view,
Pressed by thine own in a promise true,
Sprinkled with tears as the morning dew,
Will be waiting there.
Waiting and beckoning on and on,
Resting from toil in that palace home,
Eager to know will the children come
To these mansions fair.

On a hill outside Jerusalem
Soldiers led Him there to die for them
As they nailed the hands that created men
He prayed that they would be forgiven
A lowly carpenter from Galilee
Loved the wealth that's found in poverty
Heaven's power clothed in humility
Let the cross become His destiny
Through His stripes, I am healed
Through my hate, His love revealed
Through my sin, shines His light
Through His death He gives me life
Heaven's irony
The Father's love is full and free
Heaven's irony
Jesus loves me
As the blood flowed from His wounded side
Tears of love flowed as my Jesus cried
And the people mocked Him as He died
The innocent was crucified
In a borrowed tomb they buried Him
With a paupers shroud they covered Him
In a grave of hardly any worth
Lay the Maker of the universe
Bridge
And oh what a wonderful love I have known
Like a river of life to my soul (river of life to my soul)
And oh what love (oh what love) the Savior has shown
Making my heart His home
After three days as He prophesied
The stone was rolled away, no one inside
Jesus resurrected, glorified
He's the way, the truth, the life.
(He loves me)
Heaven's irony (Heaven's irony)
The Father's love is full and free
Heaven's irony
Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me

Some glad morning we shall see, Jesus in the air
Coming after you and me, joy is ours to share 
What rejoicing there will be, when the saints shall rise
Headed for that jubilee, yonder in the skies 
Oh what singing, oh what shouting
On that happy morning when we all shall rise
Oh what glory, Hallelujah
When we meet our blessed Savior in the skies 
Seems that now I almost see, all the sainted dead
Rising for that jubilee, that is just ahead
In the twinkling of an eye, changed with them to be
All the living saints to fly, to that jubilee.
Oh what singing, oh what shouting
On that happy morning when we all shall rise
Oh what glory, Hallelujah
When we meet our blessed Savior in the skies 
When with all that heavenly host, we begin to sing
Singing in the Holy Ghost, how the heavens will ring
Millions there will join the song, with them we shall be
Praising Christ through ages long, heaven's jubilee.
Oh what singing, oh what shouting
On that happy morning when we all shall rise
Oh what glory, Hallelujah
When we meet our blessed Savior in the skies

I've got a robe,
You've got a robe,
All God's Children got a robe;
When I get to Heaven,
Goint to put on my robe,
Goin' to shout all over God's Heav'n.
Heav'n, Heav'n,
Ev'rybody talkin' 'bout
Heav'n ain't agoin' there,
Heav'n, Heav'n,
Goin' to shout all over God's Heav'n.
I've got a crown,
You've got a crown,
All God's Children got a crown;
When I get to Heaven,
Goint to put on my crown,
Goin' to shout all over God's Heav'n.
I've got a song,
You've got a song,
All God's Children got a song;
When I get to Heaven,
Goint to put on my song,
Goin' to shout all over God's Heav'n.

Oh will you come to Jesus
His invitation hear
Don't let your life be wasted
For death is drawing near 
Your life is but a vapor
That vanisheth away
Oh will you not hear Jesus
And heed His call today 
The greatest of decisions
Is only your own choice
The angels now in heaven
Are waiting to rejoice 
Don't wait until tomorrow
And Satan's calling heed
Your soul is now in danger
The Savior's blood you need 

Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?
Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?
Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,
Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.
Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?
How canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?
Up, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;
Haste to receive Him descending the skies.
Earth’s mighty nations, in strife and commotion,
Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;
Listen, ’tis naught but the chariot’s loud rumbling;
Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.
Stay not, O stay not, for earth’s vain allurements!
See how its glory is passing away;
Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o’er thee;
Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.
Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;
Watch for the glory of earth’s coming King;
Lo! o’er the mountain tops light is now breaking;
Heirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing.

Safe is my refuge, sweet is my rest,
Ill cannot harm me, nor foes e’er molest;
Jesus my spirit so tenderly calms,
Holding me close in His mighty arms.
Oh! what wonderful, wonderful rest!
Trusting completely in Jesus I’m blest;
Sweetly He comforts and shields from alarms,
Holding me safe in His mighty arms.
Pressing my tear stained cheek to His own,
Hushing my grief with His sweet gentle tone;
Touching my heart with His healing balms,
Holding me still in His mighty arms.
Tempests may rage, sin’s surges may beat,
Ne’er can they reach my sheltered retreat;
Free from all danger, from dread alarms,
Resting so safe in His mighty arms.

My Father has many dear children;
Will He ever forget to keep me?
He gave His own Son to redeem them,
And He cannot forget to keep me.
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
He gave His own Son to redeem me,
And He'll never forget to keep me.
Our Father remembers the sparrows,
Their value and fall doth He see;
But dearer to Him are His children,
And He'll never forget to keep me.
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
But dearer to Him are His children,
And He'll never forget to keep me.
The words of the Lord are so priceless,
How patient and watchful is He;
Though mother forget her own offspring,
Yet He'll never forget to keep me.
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
Though mother forget her own offspring,
Yet He'll never forget to keep me.
I now will abide in His shadow,
Never restless nor fearful will be;
In the secret of His presence He'll hide me,
And He'll never forget to keep me.
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
He'll never forget to keep me (keep me),
In the secret of His presence He'll hide me,
And He'll never forget to keep me.
O brother, why don't you accept Him?
He offers salvation so free;
Repent and believe and obey Him,
And He'll never forget to keep thee.
He'll never forget to keep thee (keep thee),
He'll never forget to keep thee (keep thee),
Repent and believe and obey Him,
And He'll never forget to keep thee.

I know that my Savior will never forsake,
I know that my faith in Him never will shake;
My journey a pathway of gladness He’ll make,
He’ll walk with me all the way.
He’ll walk with me all the way,
He’ll walk with me all the way.
He’ll help me o’er sin the vict’ry to win,
And walk with me all the way.
He’ll lead me in paths that are pleasant and green,
And show me new glories, so long since unseen;
His hand will I hold all secure and serene,
He’ll walk with me all the way.
My eyes will new beauty and glory perceive,
As daily His blessing life’ tangles unweave;
I’ll hold to His hand and no more let Him leave;
He’ll walk with me all the way.

Help, Lord, for men of virtue fail,
Religion loses ground,
The sons of violence prevail,
And treacheries abound.
Their oaths and promises they break,
Yet act the flatterer’s part;
With fair, deceitful lips they speak,
And with a double heart.
If we reprove some hateful lie,
How is their fury stirred!
“Are not our lips our own?" they cry;
“And who shall be our Lord?"
Scoffers appear on every side,
Where a vile race of men
Is raised to seats of power and pride,
And bears the sword in vain.
Lord, when iniquities abound,
And blasphemy grows bold,;
When faith is hardly to be found,
And love is waxing cold;
Is not Thy chariot hastening on?
Hast Thou not giv’n this sign?
May we not trust and live upon
A promise so divine?
“Yes," saith the Lord, “now will I rise,
And make oppressors flee;
I shall appear to their surprise,
And set My servants free."
Thy Word, like silver sev’n times tried,
Through ages shall endure;
The men that in Thy truth confide
Shall find the promise sure.

Help me find my way, Lord,
Help me find my way;
Through the mist and shadows,
To the dawning day;
Darkness ’round me gathers,
Not a glint or ray;
Help me, blessed Jesus,
Help me find my way.
Help me find my way, Lord,
Help me find my way;
May I through each valley
In Thy footsteps stay;
If ’twere but my choosing,
I’d soon go astray;
Lest I faint or stumble,
Help me find my way.
Help me find my way,
Lord, Help me find my way;
Briar-torn and bruised,
Filled with sore dismay,
Till my head is drooping,
And my heart gives way;
Help me, blessed Jesus,
Help me find my way.
Now I rest in Jesus,
Know His peace alway;
Light He gave for darkness,
Turned my night to day;
Joy He gave for sadness,
Till I now can say,
“Thou has helped me, Savior,
Helped me find Thy way."

Help me, O Lord, the God of my salvation;
I have no hope, no refuge but in Thee;
Help me to make this perfect consecration,
In life or death Thine evermore to be.
Help me, O Lord, to keep my pledge unbroken;
Guard Thou my ways, my thoughts, my tongue, my heart;
Help me to trust the word which Thou hast spoken,
That from Thy paths my feet may ne’er depart.
Help me, O Lord, when sore temptations press me;
O lift the clouds that hide Thee from my sight;
Help me, O Lord, when anxious cares distress me,
To look beyond, where all is calm and bright.
Help me, O Lord, my strength is only weakness;
Thine, Thine the power by which alone I live;
Help me each day, to bear the cross with meekness,
Till Thou at last the promised crown shalt give.

Look all around you, find someone in need,
Help somebody today!
Though it be little—a neighborly deed—
Help somebody today! 
Help somebody today,
Somebody along life’s way;
Let sorrow be ended, the friendless befriended,
Oh, help somebody today! 
Many are waiting a kind, loving word,
Help somebody today!
Thou hast a message, oh, let it be heard,
Help somebody today! 
Many have burdens too heavy to bear,
Help somebody today!
Grief is the portion of some everywhere,
Help somebody today! 
Some are discouraged and weary in heart,
Help somebody today!
Someone the journey to heaven should start,
Help somebody today! 

Help us to help each other, Lord,
each other's cross to bear;
let each his friendly aid afford,
and feel his brother's care.
Up into thee, our living head,
let us in all things grow,
and by thy sacrifice be led
the fruits of love to show.
Drawn by the magnet of thy love
let all our hearts agree;
and ever towards each other move,
and ever move towards thee.
This is the bond of perfectness,
thy spotless charity.
O let us still, we pray, possess
the mind that was in thee.

Help us to labor on,
Savior, for Thee;
Faithful in word and deed,
O may we be.
Till all our work is done,
Our crown of glory won,
Help us, Lord, to labor on,
Trusting in Thee.
Help us to labor on,
Cheered from above;
Sowing the word of life,
Telling Thy love.
Help us to labor on,
Lord, not in vain;
O may we gather in,
Bright, golden grain.

Help us, O Jesus, Thou mighty Defender,
Help when the forces of evil appear;
Help us to battle and never surrender,
Help us to conquer, and drive away fear;
Satan is cunning, the prince of deceivers,
Bringing disaster to many believers.
Help us, O Jesus, in hours of temptation,
When both our faith and our courage are weak;
Teach us to look to the sign of salvation,
And near Thy cross a new armor to seek;
Then we shall conquer, if Thou wilt befriend us,
Thou wilt prevail and our faith will defend us.
Help us, O Jesus, when death shall spread terror,
And our poor eyes are too feeble to see;
Cleanse us and purge us from sin and from error;
That we may blindly in faith cling to Thee;
Help us, O Jesus, we conquer in dying,
Unto the last on Thy mercy relying.

Help us, O Lord! Behold, we enter
Upon another year today;
In Thee our hopes and thoughts now center,
Renew our courage for the way.
New life, new strength, new happiness,
We ask of Thee—oh, hear and bless!
May every plan and undertaking
This year be all begun with Thee;
When I am sleeping or am waking,
Still let me know Thou art with me.
Abroad do Thou my footsteps guide,
At home be ever at my side.
Be this a time of grace and pardon.
Thy rod I take with willing mind,
But suffer naught my heart to harden;
Oh, let me then Thy mercy find!
In Thee alone, my God, I live;
Thou only canst my sins forgive.
And may this year to me be holy;
Thy grace so fill my every thought
That all my life be pure and lowly
And truthful, as a Christian’s ought.
So make me while yet dwelling here
Pious and blest from year to year.
Jesus, be with me and direct me;
Jesus, my plans and hopes inspire;
Jesus, from tempting thoughts protect me;
Jesus, be all my heart’s desire;
Jesus, be in my thoughts all day
Nor suffer me to fall away.
And grant, Lord, when the year is over,
That it for me in peace may close;
In all things care for me and cover
My head in time of fear and woes.
So may I when my years are gone
Appear with joy before Thy throne.

Help, Lord, for those who love Thee fail,
Thy faithful ones fall from the ranks,
And leave the liars to their tale,
False gratitude and treacherous thanks.
Lord, may those flattering lips be lashed,
The boasting mouths stripped of their pride,
Those tongues that murmur unabashed,
Who is this God? We shall abide!
“Because the poor have been oppressed,
And in their patience sigh alone,
I will protect them in My breast,"
The Lord has said, “These are Mine own."
And what He saith is purified
Like silver, sevenfold assayed.
Though by this evil age defied,
His Word of truth shall be obeyed.
His promises shall stand secure,
His saints are safe, though ill betide,
He will protect His humble poor,
Though rogues are honored far and wide.

Her Virgin eyes saw God incarnate born,
when she to Bethlehem came that happy morn:
how high her raptures then began to swell,
none but her own omniscient Son can tell.
As Eve, when she her fontal sin reviewed,
wept for herself and all she should include,
blest Mary, with man's Saviour in embrace,
joyed for herself and for all human race.
All saints are by her Son's dear influence blest;
she kept the very fountain at her breast:
the Son adored and nursed by the sweet Maid
a thousandfold of love for love repaid.
Heaven with transcendent joys her entrance graced,
near to his throne her Son his Mother placed;
and here below, now she's of heaven possest,
all generations are to call

Herald, in the wilderness,
Breaking up the road,
Sinking mountains, raising plains,
For the path of God;
Prophet, to the multitudes
Calling to repent,
In the way of righteousness
Unto Israel sent;
Messenger, God’s chosen one
Foremost to proclaim,
Proffered titles passing by,
Pointing to the Lamb.
Captive, for the word of truth
Boldly witnessing;
Then in Herod’s dungeon cave,
Faint and languishing;
Martyr, sacrificed to sin
At that feast of shame;
As his life foreshowed the Lord,
In his death the same—
Holy Jesus, when He heard,
Went apart to pray:
Thus may we our lesson take
From his saint today.
her blest.

Heralds of Christ, who bear the King’s commands,
Immortal tidings in your mortal hands,
Pass on and carry swift the news you bring;
Make straight, make straight the highway of the King.
Through desert ways, dark fen and deep morass,
Through jungles, sluggish seas, and mountain pass,
Build now the road, and falter not, nor stay;
Prepare across the earth the King’s highway.
Where once the twisting trail in darkness wound,
Let marching feet and joyous song resound,
Where burn the funeral pyres, and censers swing,
Make straight, make straight the highway of the King.
Lord, give us faith and strength the road to build,
To see the promise of the day fulfilled,
When war shall be no more, and strife shall cease
Upon the highway of the Prince of Peace.

White is the harvest, calls the Master for you,
Reapers are needed that are faithful and true;
Thrust in the sickle, all the sheaves gather in;
Go with gospel tidings, go the lost world to win.
Heralds of truth from the dawn till close of day,
Tell of His love to the millions, don’t delay;
See, they are perishing, in sin they repine,
Go, ye gospel heralds, with the message divine.
Search in the highways, bid the wand’rer to come,
Rescue the dying, all the lost gather home;
Stay not in idleness, the shadows will fall,
Fast the day is waning, tell the story to all.
Over the billows comes a heart-rending cry—
Wails from the millions who in sin hopeless die,
Pleading for mercy who will cross o’er the waves,
With the blessed tidings, “Jesus saves, Jesus saves"? 
Swift toward eternity they haste, nor they wait,
Fast they are perishing, how sad is their state!
Work ere the day decline and soon come the night,
Till the world is flaming with the pure, gospel light.
Haste then, ye messengers, nor tarry for dross,
Bid every guilty one to bow at His cross,
Washing away their crimson stains in His blood,
Till the world of sinners is redeemed unto God.

Work for Jesus, little ones,
He has work for you;
At your home, at school, at play,
There is work to do.
Here am I, Lord Jesus,
Here am I—send me!
Let me do Thy bidding,
Let me work for Thee.
Someone needs a helping hand—
Help with all your might;
Little hands may helpers be,
Making burdens light.
Someone needs a little time—
You have time to spare;
Be a helper, little one,
Helping everywhere.

Hast Thou, O Lord, a work to do?
Here am I, send me!
The field is white, the lab’rers few,
Here am I, send me!
Over mountain, plain or sea,
Here am I, send me!
I’ll go to the ends of the earth for Thee,
Here am I, send me!
O touch my lips with fire divine,
Here am I, send me!
The dross consume, the gold refine,
Here am I, send me!
A lowly vessel at Thy feet,
Here am I, send me!
O cleanse and for Thy use make meet,
Here am I, send me!
My heart now longs and yearns to go,
Here am I, send me!
To reap Thy harvest here below,
Here am I, send me!

Here at Bethesda’s pool, the poor,
The withered, halt, and blind;
With waiting hearts expect a cure,
And free admittance find.
Here streams of wondrous virtue flow
To heal a sin-sick soul;
To wash the filthy white as snow,
And make the wounded whole.
The dumb break forth in songs of praise,
The blind their fight receive;
The cripple runs in wisdom’s ways,
The dead revive, and live!
Restrained to no one case, or time,
These waters always move;
Sinners, in every age and clime,
Their vital influence prove.
Yet numbers daily near them lie,
Who meet with no relief;
With life in view they pine and die
In hopeless unbelief.
’Tis strange they should refuse to bathe,
And yet frequent the pool;
But none can even wish for faith,
While love of sin bears rule.
Satan their consciences has sealed,
And stupefied their thought;
For were they willing to be healed,
The cure would soon be wrought.
Do Thou, dear Savior, interpose,
Their stubborn wills constrain;
Or else to them the water flows,
And grace is preached in vain.

Here at Thy table, Lord, this sacred hour,
O let us feel Thee near, in loving power,
Calling our thoughts away from self and sin
As to Thy banquet hall we enter in.
Sit at the feast, dear Lord, break Thou the bread;
Fill Thou the cup that brings life to the dead;
That we may find in Thee pardon and peace,
And from all bondage win a full release.
So shall our life of faith be full, be sweet;
And we shall find our strength for each day meet;
Fed by Thy living bread, all hunger past,
We shall be satisfied, and saved at last.
Come then, O holy Christ, feed us, we pray;
Touch with Thy pierced hand each common day;
Making this earthly life full of Thy grace,
Till in the home of heaven we find our place.

Here from the world we turn, Jesus to seek;
Here may His loving voice tenderly speak!
Jesus, our dearest Friend, while at Thy feet we bend,
O let Thy smile descend! ’Tis Thee we seek.
Come, holy Comforter, Presence divine,
Now in our longing hearts graciously shine;
O for Thy mighty power! O for a blessed shower,
Filling this hallowed hour with joy divine!
Savior, Thy work revive; here may we see
Those who are dead in sin quickened by Thee;
Come to our hearts tonight, make every burden light;
Cheer Thou our waiting sight; we long for Thee.

Here I am, an ordinary face
In this world, a constant changing place
I understand my life is just a simple page
In the book of life, I pray
Holding on to what I’ve done before
I turn to you, and you open up my door
Guide me through an endless journey; I’ll be true
And live my life for you
Here I am; I understand
The simple life that you’ve created
Majesty, I beg you please
Bring the peace to me; I’ve waited
Here I am; you know the plan
Mold my life, and help me shape it
Lord, you see; I’m on my knees
My heart is yours forever: take it
In your hands, I know that I am safe
Amazing love, you save me by grace
Without your name, I know my life is not the same
I need your sweet embrace
Here I am (here I am)
Here I am (here I am)
Here I am (here I am; I understand; here I am)
Here I am (here I am; you know the plan; here I am)
Here I am

Oh and Father (Here I am)
I've the wood, you have the fire, but where's the sacrifice?
God gave the ram (God gave the ram), God gave the ram (God gave the ram)

Would you give you only life?
Father (Here I am)
I have come to speak, to live your love for man
Oh and Father (Here I am)
I'll take the wood upon my back, and I'll be the sacrifice
God gave the Lamb (God gave the Lamb), God gave the Lamb (God gave the Lamb)
With no one to stay His hand, He gave His only Son
God gave the Lamb (God gave the Lamb), God gave the Lamb (God gave the Lamb)
Through His mercy and His love, God gave the Lamb
Through His mercy and His love, God gave the Lamb

Here in Thy name, eternal God,
We dedicate this house to Thee.
Oh, choose it for Thy fixed abode
And keep it from all error free! 
Here, when Thy people seek Thy face
And dying sinners pray to live,
Hear Thou in heaven, Thy dwelling-place;
And when Thou hearest, Lord, forgive.
Here, when Thy messengers proclaim
The blessed Gospel of Thy Son,
Still by the power of His great name
Be mighty signs and wonders done.
When children's voices raise the song,
"Hosanna to the heavenly King!"
Let heaven with earth the strain prolong.
Hosanna! let the angels sing.
Thy glory never hence depart.
Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone;
Thy kingdom come to every heart,
In every bosom fix Thy throne.

Here is love, vast as the ocean,
Lovingkindness as the flood,
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom,
Shed for us His precious blood.
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten,
Throughout Heav’n’s eternal days.
On the mount of crucifixion,
Fountains opened deep and wide;
Through the floodgates of God’s mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And Heav’n’s peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.
Let me all Thy love accepting,
Love Thee, ever all my days;
Let me seek Thy kingdom only
And my life be to Thy praise;
Thou alone shalt be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see.
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me,
Thou Thyself hast set me free.
In Thy truth Thou dost direct me
By Thy Spirit through Thy Word;
And Thy grace my need is meeting,
As I trust in Thee, my Lord.
Of Thy fullness Thou art pouring
Thy great love and power on me,
Without measure, full and boundless,
Drawing out my heart to Thee.

Here we are in your presence
Lifting holy hands to you
Here we are praising Jesus
For the things he's brought us through
Well, I don't have the words to tell you how I feel
I just don't know what I can say
But I'm not worthy to speak your holy name
Yet you tell me you love me just the same
Well, I never thought that it could be this way
I never though I'd be the one
But you found me when I was dying in my sin
You looked at me with love and took me in
For the things he's brought us through

Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas) 
Here we come a-caroling among the leaves so green
Here we come a-wondering so fair to be seen
Love and joy come to you, and to you your carol too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year 
Said the night wind to the little lamb
"Do you see what I see? (Do you see what I see?)"
Way up in the sky little lamb
"Do you see what I see? (Do you see what I see?)" 
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite 
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains 
And the mountains in reply 
Echoing their joyous strains 
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo 
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord 
Here we come a-caroling among the leaves so green
Here we come a-wondering so fair to be seen 
Joy to the world, The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King 

Here, Lord, we offer Thee all that is fairest,
Bloom from the garden, and flowers from the field;
Gifts for the stricken ones, knowing Thou carest
More for the love than the wealth that we yield.
Send, Lord, by these to the sick and the dying,
Speak to their hearts with a message of peace;
Comfort the sad, who in weakness are lying,
Grant the departing a gentle release.
Raise, Lord, to health those again who have sickened,
Fair be their lives as the roses in bloom;
Give of Thy grace to the souls Thou hast quickened,
Gladness for sorrow, and brightness for gloom.
We, Lord, like flowers, must bloom and must wither;
We, like these blooms, must fade and must die;
Gather us, Lord, to Thy bosom forever,
Grant us a place in Thy house in the sky.

Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;
Here would I touch and handle things unseen;
Here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.
This is the hour of banquet and of song;
This is the heavenly table spread for me;
Here let me feast, and feasting, still prolong
The hallowed hour of fellowship with Thee.
Here would I feed upon the bread of God,
Here drink with Thee the royal wine of Heaven;
Here would I lay aside each earthly load,
Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.
I have no help but Thine; nor do I need
Another arm save Thine to lean upon;
It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;
My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.
I have no wisdom save in Him Who is
My Wisdom and my Teacher both in One;
No wisdom can I lack while Thou art wise;
No teaching do I crave save Thine alone.
Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness:
Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood;
Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace;
Thy Blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord my God!
Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;
The feast, though not the love, is past and gone.
The bread and wine remove; but Thou art here,
Nearer than ever, still my Shield and Sun.
Feast after feast thus comes and passes by;
Yet, passing, points to the glad feast above,
Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,
The Lamb’s great bridal feast of bliss and love.

Why should I charge my soul with care?
The wealth of every mine
Belongs to Christ, God’s Son and Heir,
And He’s a Friend of mine.
Yes, He’s a Friend of mine,
And He with me doth all things share;
Since all is Christ’s, and Christ is mine,
Why should I have a care?
For Jesus is a Friend of mine.
The silver moon, the golden sun,
The countless stars that shine,
Are His alone, yes, every one,
And He’s a Friend of mine.
He daily spreads a glorious feast,
And at His table dine
The whole creation, man and beast,
And He’s a Friend of mine.
And when he comes in bright array,
And leads the conqu’ring line,
It will be glory then to say,
That He’s a Friend of mine.

I was lost in sin, but Jesus rescued me,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me;
I was bound by fear, but Jesus set me free,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me.
For He’s a wonderful Savior to me,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me;
I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in:
He’s a wonderful Savior to me.
He’s a Friend so true, so patient and so kind,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me;
Everything I need in Him I always find,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me.
He is always near to comfort and to cheer,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me;
He forgives my sins, He dries my every tear,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me.
Dearer grows the love of Jesus day by day,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me.
Sweeter is His grace while pressing on my way,
He’s a wonderful Savior to me.

A sinner more wretched than I,
There could not be;
’Till Jesus the mighty, came nigh,
To set me free,
I opened my heart to His call,
His own to be,
And when I surrendered all,
My Lord saved me.
He’s able and willing to save,
Able, willing,
He’s able and willing to save,
For He saved me.
His power no limit can know,
His grace is mine;
His love He is willing to show,
’Tis love divine;
His mercy is offered today,
So full, so free,
He’ll never turn you away,
For He saved me.
He’s able and willing to go
O’er mountains steep,
Or down in the valley so low,
Or stormy deep:
If willing His bidding to do,
His own you’ll be,
I know He can keep you true,
For He keeps me.

The gates and doors were barred
The windows fastened down
Spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at ev'ry sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
Half in fear of the day
To find the soldiers breaking thru 
To drag us all away 
Just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gates began to rattle
A voice began to call
I hurried to the window
To look down to the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet.
No one there but Mary
And so I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told us where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The stone's been rolled away
And His body isn't there 
We both ran toward the garden
And then John ran ahead
We found the stone and the empty tomb
Just the way that Mary'd said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in was just an empty shell
And how and why they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell 
Something strange had happened there
Just what I didn't know
John believed in a miracle 
I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I had seen Him crucified
Then I watched Him die 
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him 
Just added to my shame
When at last it came a choice
I denied I knew His name
But even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same 
Suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from ev'rywhere took shadows from the room
Jesus stood before me with His arms open wide
And I fell down upon my knees and just clung to Him and cried 
He raised me to my feet as I looked into His eyes
Love was shining out from Him like sunlight from the skies (sunlight from the 
skies)
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release (sweet release)
Every fear that I'd ever had just melted into peace 
He's alive! (He's alive!)
He's alive! (He's alive!)
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide 

There’s a blessed hope that thrills my heart to know
That the Christ Who came to earth so long ago,
Bearing all our sins because He loved us so,
Promised He’d come back again some day.
Coming, oh, yes, He’s coming,
The very same as when He went away,
Coming, my Lord is coming,
Oh praise His blessed Name,
He’s coming back some day.
He Who on the cross for me was crucified,
He Who for my sin and shame in anguish died,
He Whose resurrection fully justified,
Promised He’d come back again some day.
When He comes again ’twill be as King of kings,
Perfect peace and joy to all the earth He’ll bring,
Then throughout eternity, His praise we’ll sing,
When, in glory, He returns some day.

In these, the closing days of time,
What joy the glorious hope affords,
That soon—O wondrous truth sublime!
He shall reign, King of kings and Lord of Lords.
He’s coming soon, He’s coming soon;
With joy we welcome His returning;
It may be morn, it may be night or noon—
We know He’s coming soon.
The signs around—in earth and air,
Or painted on the starlit sky,
God’s faithful witnesses—declare
That the coming of the Savior draweth nigh.
The dead in Christ who ’neath us lie,
In countless numbers, all shall rise
When through the portals of the sky
He shall come to prepare our paradise.
And we, who living, yet remain,
Caught up, shall meet our faithful Lord;
This hope we cherish not in vain,
But we comfort one another by this word.

My Savior’s love is sweeter still,
Each day I try to do His will;
My heart with peace and joy He fills,
He’s everything to me.
He’s all in all to me today,
Into my heart He’s come to stay;
He’s all in all to me today,
He’s everything to me.
Such wondrous blessings o’er me stole,
When Jesus came and made me whole,
His love like billows o’er me roll,
He’s everything to me.
No good thing does my Lord deny,
I feel His presence ever nigh;
Earth’s pleasures fail to satisfy,
He’s everything to me.
I’m watching for my King’s return,
To see His face my soul doth yearn,
Yet day by day I live to learn,
He’s everything to me.

Even though the wind may blow
Troubles toss you to end and fro
Get on your knees and give it time
There the answers you will find in Jesus
He's gonna let you know
In my darkest hours
I have never been alone
Tho' I could not see the Son
I knew He was right there
Oh yes He was
When your heart turns sour
And your faith has all but flown
Seek the Holy Spirit
And He will be right there
I've got to have the Lord's direction
Simply for my own protection
At my weakest moment
Is the time that He will be strong
He will not forsake you
You know He will be right there
He has made the difference
In the Lord you can't go wrong 
What you need He's gonna give you
He's gonna be right there yes He will
Put your cares upon the Lord
And live with Him in one accord
Oh the storm is a vicious pill to swallow
For the path becomes unclear
But through it all He is holding my tomorrow
Leaning on the Master will bring peace instead of tears
I have seen His power
Coming down from heaven's throne
As he showered the blessings
I knew He was right there, right there
Like a mighty tower
He's the rock that we call home
When he comes I'm gonna be running
I'm gonna be up there
I'm gonna be with the Lord
Oh I don't really understand it
But I know that I can't live without it 
Even though the wind may blow (you know it's gonna blow sometimes)
Troubles toss you to end and fro (help me, Lord, to make up my mind)
Get on your knees and give it time (gotta need you)
There the answers you will find in Jesus (gotta need you)
He's gonna let you know (He gonna let you know)
Even though the wind may blow (Oh, we need the Lord in our lives)
Troubles toss you to end and fro (I can't make it on my own)
Get on your knees and give it time (One day gonna be with Him, oh yeah)
There the answers you will find in Jesus
He's gonna let you, let you know

As you travel down life's road.
He is with you every day.
With every step you take He's walked ahead of you.
And every night as you lay down
Angels are camping all around.
I'll never be alone for He is in the midst.
Into the prison they were thrown.
Paul and Silas weren't alone.
They knew their God was there
And He would see them through.
So when the walls began to shake
And all their chains just fell away.
They cried behold Our God for He is in the midst.
He's In The Midst
He's in the midst of our storm.
He's in the valley we walk through.
Where two or three are gathered in His name
.He'll be there too.
When you feel so all alone,
He is standing next to you.
He's with us now
.our Lord, He's in the midst.

I'm tired of livin' for Fridays, tired of dreadin' Mondays
So tired of what this world considers right
I just want to make a difference as I travel here below
I want somehow to let this whole world know
He's Lord of all (He's Lord of all) and Lord of me (and Lord of me)
And Lord of everything I'm gonna be
Someday I'm gonna see Him in a place I call home
Someday I'll humbly bow before His throne
If I can only show He loves them, I can show they need Him
If I can show how much He's done for me
There'll be no way to stop them from reaching for salvation
They'll be no way to stop loves overflow
Because.
I will be made perfect, all my imperfections gone
The lamb who died will occupy the throne
We'll all glorify Him, free at last from Satan's wrong
We will all join in the victory's song
We'll sing.
Someday I'm gonna meet Him in a place I call home
Someday I'll humbly bow before His throne
Because He's Lord of al.

He's still working on me
To make me what I need to be
It took him just a week to make the moon and stars
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars
How loving and patient He must be
'Cause He's still workin' on me 
There really ought to be a sign upon my heart
Don't judge him yet, there's an unfinished part
But I'll be better just according to His plan
Fashioned by the Master's loving hands 
In the mirror of His word
Reflections that I see
Makes me wonder why He never gave up on me
But He loves me as I am and helps me when I pray
Remember He's the potter; I'm the clay 

Is there anyone can help us, one who understands our hearts,
When the thorns of life have pierced them till they bleed;
One who sympathizes with us, who in wondrous love imparts
Just the very very blessing that we need?
Yes, there's One, only One,
The blessed, blessed Jesus, He's the One!
When afflictions press the soul, When waves of trouble roll,
And you need a friend to help you, He's the One.
Is there anyone can help us, who can give the sinner peace,
When his heart is burdened down with pain and woe;
Who can speak the word of pardon that affords a sweet release,
And whose blood can wash and make us white as snow?
Is there anyone can help us, when the end is drawing near,
Who will go thro' death's dark waters by our side;
Who will light the way before us, and dispel all doubts and fears,
And will bear our spirits safely o'er the tide? 

I'm hid away with Christ in God,
Yes, hid away with Jesus;
I'm now beneath the dripping blood,
I'm hid away with Jesus;
I'm walking with my blessed Lord,
I'm trusting in His precious word,
I find His service is not hard,
I'm hid away with Jesus.
I'm hid away, yes, hid away,
I'm hid with Christ in God;
I'm dead to sin, alive in Christ,
I'm washed in His blood.
The narrow way is now so plain,
I'm hid away with Jesus;
That fools shall never err therein,
I'm hid away with Jesus;
The gate that's strait is just before,
Which when we reach we'll sigh no more,
Our sorrows then will all be o弾r,
I'm hid away with Jesus.
Oh, brother dear, to keep good cheer,
Be hid away with Jesus;
For then you'll find your Savior near,
Keep hid away with Jesus;
We池e basking now in heaven's light,
By faith and prayer our way shines bright,
We get so near that heav'n's in sight,
When hid away with Jesus.
Oh, sinner turn to God and live,
Be hid away with Jesus;
A crown of life to you He'll give,
When hid away with Jesus;
Repent, believe, and love Him too,
For He has done so much for you,
He'll wash and cleanse you through and through,
Be hid away with Jesus.

I cannot tell thee whence it came,
This peace within my breast;
But this I know, there fills my soul
A strange and tranquil rest.
There’s a deep, settled peace in my soul,
There’s a deep, settled peace in my soul,
Tho’ the billows of sin near me roll,
He abides, Christ abides.
Beneath the toil and care of life,
This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.
I cannot tell the half of love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest inmost self
With beams of hope to shine.
I cannot tell thee why He chose
To suffer and to die,
But if I suffer here with Him
I’ll reign with Him on high.

Hide God’s Word in your heart,
Its precious truth believe;
At His command take from His hand,
The Bread of Life receive.
Hide God’s Word in your heart,
Hide God’s Word in your heart—
His Word of love sent from above,
Hide God’s Word in your heart.
Hide God’s Word in your heart,
If you would grow in grace,
And like Him be until you see
Your Master face to face.
Hide God’s Word in your heart,
And seek the Spirit’s pow’r
To understand each blest command
He gives from hour to hour.
Hide God’s Word in your heart,
And, having hidden well,
Seek out the lost, the tempest tossed,
Go forth His love to tell.
Hide God’s Word in your heart,
Each day a verse repeat;
Tho’ sin allure success is sure,
You cannot have defeat.

Keep me as the apple of Thine eye,
Joyful in the glory pardon brings;
Help me, Lord, to trust Thee, though I die,
Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings.
Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,
Hide me till this stormy life is o’er;
Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,
Hide me, Savior, hide me evermore.
Keep me as the apple of Thine eye,
Unto Thee by faith my spirit clings;
Help me at Thy feet to passive lie,
Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings.
Keep me as the apple of Thine eye,
From the awful blight of sinful things;
Firmly on Thy promise I rely,
Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings.
Keep me as the apple of Thine eye,
While my faith in full assurance sings;
Victory as upward I shall fly,
Covered with the shadow of Thy wings.

Hide me away, O Lord (Hide me away, O Lord)
Hide me away, O Lord (Hide me away, O)
In the day of trouble 'neath the shadow of your wings
Hide me away, O Lord (Hide me away, O Lord) 
Give me your peace, O Lord (Give me your peace, O Lord)
Give me your peace, O Lord (Give me your peace, O)
In the day of trouble 'neath the shadow of your wings
Give me your peace, O Lord (Give me your peace, O Lord) 
Safe in your dwelling place (Safe in your dwelling place)
Safe in your dwelling place (Safe in your dwelling)
In the day of trouble 'neath the shadow of your wings
Safe in your dwelling place (Safe in your dwelling place) 
Hide me away, O Lord (Hide me away, O Lord)
Hide me away, O Lord (Hide me away, O Lord) 

Oh Thou blessed rock of ages (rock of ages I am)
Trusting now dear Lord in Thee (dear Lord in thee I'm trusting)
Keep me till my journey's ended (journey's ended, keep me)
Till Thy blessed face I see
Hide me oh blessed rock of ages (blessed rock of ages hide me)
'Til Thy blessed face I see (Thy face I see in glory)
When the storms around me rages (round me rages, blessed)
Rock of ages hide Thou me
When my journey is completed (is completed Saviour)
And there's no more work to do (no work to do oh blessed)
Saviour guide my weary spirit (weary spirit to that)
Happy land beyond the blue

In Thy cleft, O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me!
When the fitful tempest rages, hide Thou me!
Where no mortal arm can sever
From my heart Thy love forever,
Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages, safe in Thee!
From the snare of sinful pleasure, hide Thou me!
Thou, my soul’s eternal Treasure, hide Thou me!
When the world its power is wielding,
And my heart is almost yielding,
Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages, safe in Thee!
In the lonely night of sorrow, hide Thou me!
Till in glory dawns the morrow, hide Thou me!
When we’re nearing Jordan’s billow,
Let Thy bosom be my pillow;
Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages, safe in Thee!

Lord I'm tired and I'm upset, I've done things we both regret
Now I need a place to hide away
Like a child who skins his knee, how You gently comfort me
There's no bandage like the things You say
And I know that You are God, God
How can it be, that You're a father to the likes of me
And I know that you are Lord, Lord
So take this day, let me run to You and hide away
I can't go this extra mile 'til I sit with you awhile
Pour out all my heart this way
Though the day may run too swift, I can make it only if
For a moment I could hide away
And I know that You are God, God
How can it be, that You're a father to the likes of me (father to me)
And I know that you are Lord, Lord
So take this day, let me run to You and hide away
Let me run to You and hide away

God is my keeper, whom shall I fear?
Though burdens press me,
His hands caress me;
With grace to bless me,
Jesus is near.
In His mercy I will hide,
In His mercy I will hide;
In His pity He redeemed me,
In His mercy I will safely hide.
God is my portion; in life’s dark hour
He will uphold me,
Thus He hath told me;
His arms enfold me
With keeping pow’r.
God is my comfort, courage and rest,
He’ll not forsake me,
Strong He will make me,
Till He shall take me
Home with the blest.
God will be with me, faithful is He;
Friends are betraying,
Fond hopes decaying,
Still He is saying,
“Trust thou in Me."

O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine, would I be;
Thou blest “Rock of Ages," I’m hiding in Thee.
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,"
I’m hiding in Thee.
In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow’s lone hour,
In times when temptation casts o’er me its power;
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest “Rock of Ages," I’m hiding in Thee.
How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my refuge and breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.

High in the heav’ns, eternal God,
Thy goodness in full glory shines;
Thy truth shall break through every cloud
That veils and darkens Thy designs.
Forever firm Thy justice stands,
As mountains their foundations keep;
Wise are the wonders of Thy hands;
Thy judgments are a mighty deep.
Thy providence is kind and large
Both man and beast Thy bounty share;
The whole creation is Thy charge,
But saints are Thy peculiar care.
My God, how excellent Thy grace,
Whence all our hope and comfort spring!
The sons of Adam in distress
Fly to the shadow of Thy wing.
From the provisions of Thy house
We shall be fed with sweet repast;
There mercy like a river flows,
And brings salvation to our taste.
Life, like a fountain, rich and free,
Springs from the presence of the Lord;
And in Thy light our souls shall see
The glories promised in Thy Word.

High let us swell our tuneful notes,
And join the angelic throng,
For angels no such love have known
To wake cheerful song.
Good will to sinful men is shown,
And peace on earth is given:
For, lo, the incarnate Saviour comes
With grace and truth from heaven.
Justice and peace with sweet accord
His rising beams adorn;
Let heaven and earth in concert join
To us a Child is born.

High on a hill of dazzling light
The King of glory spreads His seat,
And troops of angels stretched for flight,
Stand waiting round His awful feet.
“Go," saith the Lord, “My Gabriel, go,
Salute the virgin’s fruitful womb;
Make haste, ye cherubs down below,
Sing and proclaim the Savior come."
Here a bright squadron leaves the skies,
And thick around Elisha stands;
Anon a heav’nly soldier flies,
And breaks the chains from Peter’s hands.
Thy winged troops, O God of hosts!
Wait on Thy wandering church below:
Here we are sailing to Thy coasts;
Let angels be our convoy, too.
Are they not all Thy servants, Lord?
At Thy command they go and come;
With cheerful haste obey Thy word,
And guard Thy children to their home.

High on His everlasting throne,
The King of saints His work surveys;
Marks the dear souls He calls His own,
And smiles on the peculiar race.
He rests well pleased their toils to see;
Beneath His easy yoke they move;
With all their heart and strength agree
In the sweet labor of His love.
See where the servants of their Lord,
A busy multitude, appear;
For Jesus day and night employed,
His heritage they toil to clear.
Jesus their toil delighted sees,
Their industry vouchsafes to crown;
He kindly gives the wished increase,
And sends the promised blessing down.
O multiply the sower’s seed,
And fruit we every hour shall bear;
Throughout the world Thy Gospel spread,
Thine everlasting truth declare!

High Word of God, Who once didst come,
Leaving Thy Father and Thy home,
To succor by Thy birth our kind,
When, towards Thy advent, time declined,
Pour light upon us from above,
And fire our hearts with Thy strong love,
That, as we hear Thy Gospel read,
All fond desires may flee in dread;
That when Thou comest from the skies,
Great Judge, to open Thine assize,
To give each hidden sin its smart,
And crown as kings the pure in heart,
We be not set at Thy left hand,
Where sentence due would bid us stand,
But with the saints Thy face may see,
Forever wholly loving Thee.
Praise to the Father and the Son,
Through all the ages as they run;
And to the holy Paraclete
Be praise with Them and worship meet.

I’m pressing on the upward way,
New heights I’m gaining every day;
Still praying as I’m onward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground." 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on Heaven’s tableland,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where those abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.
I want to live above the world,
Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.
I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till heav’n I’ve found,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

Higher, higher,
Higher, higher, higher,
Higher, higher, lift Jesus higher.
Higher, higher,
Higher, higher, higher,
Higher, higher, lift Jesus higher.
Cast your burdens onto Jesus,
He cares for you.
Cast your burdens onto Jesus,
He cares for you.
Lower, lower,
Lower, lower, lower,
Lower, lower, lower Satan lower.
Lower, lower,
Lower, lower, lower,
Lower, lower, lower Satan lower.

Yet my weakness is made perfect in your unfailing love.
The things I do may not mean much they seem so insufficient
I don't understand how these poor gifts can bring such delight to you
With each small step I take, I take two in the wrong direction
Yet you're always by my side gently guiding me 
I'm not perfect Lord, I never will be
Please help me to see from a higher perspective
I am weak and afraid stumbling along the way
And my weakness is made perfect in your unfailing love 
I'm frustrated by myself, by my self-indulgence
Perfection seems so far (so far away), seems so far away
But even as I mourn (even as I mourn), as I mourn my failures
You make my failures work for good and you morn my self defeat (and you keep on 
loving me)
And you morn my self defeat 
I can't compare myself to others
You made me unique
I can't wait for a change in myself
You've already made me complete
I can't submit to self-pity
As the demons in hell do
I can only cast my fears, my doubts,
My inhibitions on you 
You make me perfect Lord
You put your soul in me
And you help me to see
From a higher perspective
You give me strength when I'm afraid
You show me a better way
And my weakness is made perfect in your unfailing love
And my weakness is made perfect in your unfailing love
And my weakness is made perfect in your unfailing love (

Hills of the North, rejoice;
River and mountain spring,
Hark to the advent voice;
Valley and lowland, sing;
Though absent long, your Lord is nigh;
He judgment brings and victory.
Isles of the southern seas,
Deep in your coral caves
Pent be each warring breeze,
Lulled be your restless waves:
He comes to reign with boundless sway,
And makes your wastes His great highway.
Lands of the East, awake,
Soon shall your sons be free;
The sleep of ages break,
And rise to liberty.
On your far hills, long cold and gray,
Has dawned the everlasting day.
Shores of the utmost West,
Ye that have waited long,
Unvisited, unblest,
Break forth to swelling song;
High raise the note, that Jesus died,
Yet lives and reigns, the Crucified.
Shout, while ye journey home;
Songs be in every mouth;
Lo, from the North we come,
From East, and West, and South.
City of God, the bond are free,
We come to live and reign in thee!

Once it was the blessing,
Now it is the Lord;
Once it was the feeling,
Now it is His Word;
Once His gift I wanted,
Now, the Giver own;
Once I sought for healing,
Now Himself alone.
All in all forever,
Jesus will I sing;
Everything in Jesus,
And Jesus everything.
Once ’twas painful trying,
Now ’tis perfect trust;
Once a half salvation,
Now the uttermost;
Once ’twas ceaseless holding,
Now He holds me fast;
Once ’twas constant drifting,
Now my anchor’s cast.
Once ’twas busy planning,
Now ’tis trustful prayer;
Once ’twas anxious caring,
Now He has the care;
Once ’twas what I wanted,
Now what Jesus says;
Once ’twas constant asking,
Now ’tis ceaseless praise.
Once it was my working,
His it hence shall be;
Once I tried to use Him,
Now He uses me;
Once the pow’r I wanted,
Now the Mighty One;
Once for self I labored,
Now for Him alone.
Once I hoped in Jesus,
Now I know He’s mine;
Once my lamps were dying,
Now they brightly shine;
Once for death I waited,
Now His coming hail;
And my hopes are anchored
Safe within the veil.

His are the thousand sparkling rills
That from a thousand fountains burst,
And fill with music all the hills;
And yet He saith, “I thirst."
All fiery pangs on battlefields;
On fever beds where sick men toss,
And in that human cry He yields
To anguish on the cross.
But more than pains that racked Him then,
Was the deep longing thirst divine
That thirsted for the souls of men:
Dear Lord! and one was mine.
O Love most patient, give me grace;
Make all my soul athirst for Thee;
That parched dry lip, that fading face,
That thirst, were all for me.

We are children of the King,
And His praises we will sing,
As we journey to our home above—
His banner over us is love!
Marching! Marching!
With happy hearts we onward move;
No foe we fear, with our Captain near—
His banner over us is love!
He, the glorious Son of God,
Hath the way before us trod;
Over every foe we’ll conqu’ror prove—
His banner over us is love!
Fearless in our Leader’s might,
Strong to do and dare the right;
We will journey to our home above—
His banner over us is love!

His battle ended there, death was overcome.
Jesus, alive again, wore the victor's crown.
Clearly sin had failed, goodness had prevailed,
alleluia, alleluia;
alleluia, alleluia.
Dread powers of death and sin had him in their hold.
When Jesus rose again all their plans were foiled.
Jesus lived again, triumphed over sin,
alleluia, alleluia;
alleluia, alleluia.
Dead in the grave he lay; mourned by every friend.
Those dark and fearful days then did reach their end.
God raised him to life, victor in the strife.
alleluia, alleluia;
alleluia, alleluia.
He burst the chains of sin, opened death's dark jail.
God filled him with new life, life that could not fail.
Right before their eyes, Jesus did arise,
alleluia, alleluia;
alleluia, alleluia.
Lord, by the pains you bore in your darkest hour,
free us from fear of death, and from all sin's power.
May we with you live, to you ourselves give,
alleluia, alleluia;
alleluia, alleluia.

There’s a crimson tide from the Savior’s side,
And it purgeth all who plunge therein;
O its healing stream doth the soul redeem,
And it cleanseth from all sin.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
It cleansed my heart and made me free;
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
His blood availed for me.
There’s a boundless sea flowing full and free,
From the cross where Jesus bled and died;
O its precious flow washes white as snow,
And its mercies e’er abide.
From the contrite heart He doth ne’er depart,
But He offers pardon o’er and o’er;
He the sins doth roll from the burdened soul,
And remembers them no more.

His blood is all my plea,
Through grace divine alone,
To set the captives free,
It speaks before the throne.
His blood, His blood,
O wondrous, cleansing fountain!
His blood, His blood,
It flows from Calv’ry’s mountain.
His blood is all my plea,
Oh, wondrous, cleansing wave!
It reaches even me,
Its virtue now doth save.
His blood is all my plea,
Naught else will satisfy—
That I might ransomed be,
And not forever die.
His blood is all my plea;
His favor doth bestow
A greater love on me
Than earthly friends can show.

His cheering message from the grave
An angel to the women gave:
“Full soon your Master ye shall see;
He goes before to Galilee."
But while with flying steps they press
To bear the news, all eagerness,
Their Lord, the living Lord, they meet,
And prostrate fall to kiss His feet.
So when His mourning followers heard
The tidings of that faithful word,
Quick went they forth to Galilee,
Their loved and lost once more to see.
On that fair day of Paschal joy
The sunshine was without alloy,
When to their very eyes restored
They looked upon the risen Lord.
The wounds before their eyes displayed
They see in living light arrayed,
And that they see they testify
In open witness fearlessly.
O Christ, the King of gentleness,
Our several hearts do Thou possess,
They we may render all our days
Thy meed of thankfulness and praise.
Maker of all, to Thee we pray,
Fulfill in us Thy joy today;
When death assails, grant, Lord, that we
May share Thy Paschal victory.
To Thee Who, dead, again dost live,
All glory, Lord, Thy people give;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.

Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
I sing because I’m happy,
I sing because I’m free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.
“Let not your heart be troubled," His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

O what a wonderful Savior
In Jesus, my Lord, I have found!
Tho’ I had sins without number,
His grace unto me did abound.
His grace aboundeth more.
His grace aboundeth more.
Tho’ sin abounded in my heart,
His grace aboundeth more.
When a poor sinner He found me;
No goodness to offer had I.
Often His law I had broken
And merited naught but to die.
Nothing of merit possessing,
All helpless before Him I lay;
But, in the precious blood flowing,
He washed all my sin-stains away.
How can I keep from rejoicing?
I’ll sing of the joy in my soul,
Praising the love of my Savior
While years of eternity roll.

Just when I am disheartened,
Just when with cares oppressed,
Just when my way is darkest,
Just when I am distressed—
Then is my Savior near me,
He knows my every care;
Jesus will never leave me,
He helps my burdens bear.
His grace is enough for me, for me,
His grace is enough for me;
Through sorrow and pain,
Through loss or gain,
His grace is enough for me.
Just when my hopes are vanished,
Just when my friends forsake,
Just when the fight is thickest,
Just when with fear I shake—
Then comes a still small whisper:
“Fear not, My child, I’m near."
Jesus brings peace and comfort,
I love His voice to hear.
Just when my tears are flowing,
Just when with anguish bent,
Just when temptation’s hardest,
Just when with sadness rent—
Then comes a thought of comfort:
“I know my Father knows."
Jesus has grace sufficient
To conquer all my foes.

I'm in the path of peace
Where pleasures never cease,
And where my soul delights to be;
All worldly loss is gain,
With Jesus I remain,
For saving grace is keeping me.
His grace is keeping me,
His grace is keeping me;
All glory to His name,
His grace is keeping me.
I lean upon His arm,
He shields from ev'ry harm;
Sweet songs I sing because I'm free!
His glory lights the way
To everlasting day,
Praise God, His grace is keeping me.
His grace is keeping me,
His grace is keeping me;
All glory to His name,
His grace is keeping me.
I know that I shall sing
Hosanna to my King
When I His blessed face shall see;
I'll dwell forevermore
On that eternal shore
With Him whose grace is keeping me.
His grace is keeping me,
His grace is keeping me;
All glory to His name,
His grace is keeping me.

“I’ve anchored my soul in the Haven of Rest";
I’ve pillowed my head on the dear Savior’s breast;
I’m trusting His promise of mercy so free;
Fear not, “For My grace is sufficient for thee."
At home or abroad, on the land or the sea,
God’s wonderful grace is sufficient for me;
I’m finding it true that where’er I may be,
His grace is sufficient for me,
For me, for me, His grace is sufficient for me.
Wherever my lot upon earth may be cast,
Mid storm and mid tempest He holdeth me fast;
No harm can betide while His dear face I see,
And cling to the hand that was wounded for me.
The billows in fury around me may beat;
The “Cleft in the Rock" is my blessed retreat;
My Shield and Defender forever is He;
The Savior Whose grace is sufficient for me.
And when I have finished life’s voyage at last,
When safe in the harbor my anchor is cast,
The theme of my praises forever shall be,
God’s grace, which is always sufficient for me.

I've got a song
That I really want to sing
A song of joy (joy, joy) my very being
Oh Lord, if it were not for my God's grace
We would not be here in this place
For His mercy is everlasting
And His grace is true for you (for you, for you)
For He's a rock (rock) and a wheel (wheel) Alpha, Omega (Alpha Omega), start and 
the end
Yes, He's your friend, yeah 
He will never leave you nor deceive you
So don't you take for granted what He's done
If it had not been for my God's grace
We would not be here in this place
For His mercy is everlasting
And His grace is true for you (for you, for you)
For you I said that it's true 
He will never leave you nor deceive you
So don't you take for granted what He's done
If it were not for my God's grace
We would not be here in this place
For His mercy is everlasting
And His grace is so true, so true (for you, for you)
For His mercy is everlasting
And His grace is so true, I know it's true yeah (for you, for you)
I know it's true (for you, for you) 
His grace is true 

As I travel on my way,
To that land more fair than day,
There are beauties all along the road to see;
Heaven’s rays are shining bright,
I’ve no need for worldly light,
For I know my Savior’s hand is guiding me.
Oh, I know my Savior’s hand is guiding me,
Oh, I know my Savior’s hand is guiding me,
From this world of sin and woe,
To a land where pleasures flow;
Yes, I know my Savior’s hand is guiding me.
If as on the way I go,
Things arise I do not know,
I will wait upon the Lord that leadeth me—
He will hold me by the hand
Till I reach that happy land,
Yes, I know my Savior’s hand is guiding me.
When in sickness, trial, or test,
I am called to do my best,
I will trust the Lord the more for victory;
I will lean upon His arm,
He will keep me from all harm,
For I know my Savior’s hand is guiding me.
When I near the chilling tide,
Looking on the other side,
And my mortal bark shall sink in death’s cold sea,
Jesus then will light the way
To that land more fair than day,
For I know my Savior’s hand is guiding me.

Nothing comes between us and God’s love
Nothing below and nothing above
Height nor depth nor any other thing
Separates us from the love of the King
His love (His love)…we cannot comprehend
His love (His love)…it has no end
His love (His love)…makes the sun to shine
His love (His love)…it’s yours and it’s mine
There are those who will turn their back on Him
Say that nothing can take away their sin
But with God we know that’s not the case
Had a plan to save man with redeeming grace
His love (His love)…mends the broken
His love (His love)…keeps me hopin’
His love (His love)…freely given to all
His love (His love)…it’s so wonderful
And there are some who will choose to walk God’s path
But along the way they slip and they slide back
Look up the road, see the Father waits
There’s still a ring and shoes and a robe of grace
His love (His love)…makes a baby smile
His love (His love)…makes it all worthwhile
His love (His love)…makes the flowers grow
His love (His love)…paints the rainbow
Greater love has no man than this
Betrayed by a friend with a kiss
Proved His love while we were yet in sin
So that we might have love without end
(His love)…sent Jesus to the cross
His love (His love)…seeks to save the lost
His love (His love)…paid the debt we owed
His love (His love)…lightens every load
His love (His love)…nothing can compare
His love (His love)…it is always there
His love (His love)…shines in the darkness
He loves (He loves) me regardless

I do not ask to see the way
My feet will have to tread;
But only that my soul may feed
Upon the living Bread.
’Tis better far that I should walk
By faith close to His side;
I may not know the way I go,
But oh, I know my Guide.
His love can never fail,
His love can never fail,
My soul is satisfied to know
His love can never fail.
And if my feet would go astray,
They cannot, for I know
That Jesus guides my falt’ring steps,
As joyfully I go.
And tho’ I may not see His face,
My faith is strong and clear,
That in each hour of sore distress
My Savior will be near.
I will not fear, tho’ darkness come
Abroad o’er all the land,
If I may only feel the touch
Of His own loving hand.
And tho’ I tremble when I think
How weak I am, and frail,
My soul is satisfied to know
His love can never fail.

There is joy in my soul, for the Savior is mine,
I am wearing the pledge of His Spirit divine;
Every promise by faith through His grace I may claim,
Oh, His love passeth knowledge, all praise to His Name.
There is joy in my soul, there is joy in my song,
I am nearing the gates of the bright, shining throng;
And I list to the music of Eden so fair,
Hallelujah to Jesus, I soon shall be there.
There is joy in my soul that will never depart,
My Redeemer has made His abode in my heart;
From the tempter and sin I am kept every hour,
Oh, His love passeth knowledge, so great is its power.
There is joy in my soul though the clouds may arise,
Yet the bow of His mercy ne’er fades from the skies;
I am standing by faith where the pure waters glide,
Oh, His love passeth knowledge, so deep and so wide.
There is joy in my soul, there is rapture and rest,
In my Savior and Lord I am perfectly blest;
’Twill be only a step ere my feet press the shore,
Then “His love passeth knowledge," I’ll shout evermore.

When Jesus hung on Calvary,
He thought of you and me;
’Twas love that held Him there to be
A sacrifice for you, for me.
He thought of you, He thought of me,
While hanging there in agony;
Oh! wonder-love to you and me!
It broke His heart on Calvary.
He wore a crown on Calvary,
He thought of you and me;
He knew His thorny crown would be
A diadem for you, for me.
On that dread cross of Calvary
He thought of you and me;
He thought not of His agony;
His heart went out to you, to me.
At last He cried on Calvary,
He thought of you and me;
“ ’Tis finished for eternity!"
Oh! blessed cry for you, for me.

I am saved from sin, I have peace within,
And I walk with Jesus day by day;
O His hand so strong, holds me all day long,
And with Him I will not go astray.
He will hold me with His mighty hand!
He will hold me with His mighty hand!
In temptation He will help me stand!
For He will hold me with His mighty hand.
Many passed me by, heeding not my cry,
But the Savior heard and rescued me;
I was lost and blind, Jesus was so kind,
Lo, He touched my eyes and now I see.
There’s a promise sure, and it shall endure,
“Lo, I will be with thee all the way";
And though foes assail, I shall still prevail,
For I know He helps me watch and pray.
There is sweeter peace, there is perfect peace,
And my Father’s Word is wondrous dear;
There is mighty pow’r, for each trying hour,
There is love that “castteth out all fear!"

His Name is Wonderful
His Name is Wonderful
His Name is Wonderful
Jesus My Lord 
He is the Mighty King
Master of everything
His Name is Wonderful
Jesus My Lord 
He’s the Great shepherd
The Rock of All Ages
Almighty God is He 
Bow down before Him
Love and adore Him
His Name is Wonderful
Jesus My Lord

His oceans all rumble and batter His shore,
But He will be new when its waves are no more.
His mountains reach skyward to touch His sweet face;
His forests burst forth as He showers their place.
The mighty Leviathan leaps in His seas,
The eagle mounts up on the joy of His breeze.
The creatures of earth borrow life from His hand,
Their days are all numbered by His firm command.
Eternity springs from His Infinite Mind—
All time and all space from His fingers unwind,
His intricate, limitless, unbounded skill
Spins threads of His sovereign, inscrutable will.
The thunder of Sinai resounds in our ears,
The judgment of God stirs the deepest of fears!
But, awesome and wondrous—more staggering still—
The flashes of lightning from Calvary’s hill!
But O! How mighty, how perfect, how free,
How blessed, how precious, how lovely is He!
And O! How grand, and how sweet to behold
The trophies of grace He has won from of old!
A radiant triumph illumines His face!
He strides to His throne, the Colossus of Grace!
He sits, and His Father proclaims Him True Son!
His strife is now over; His battle is done.
We bow, we adore, we fall down at His throne,
He gathers us into His arms as His own!
He seats us in glory beside Him above,
To crown His achievement with splendors of love!

The people are calling to the Great I Am
His people are yearning for the works of His mighty hand
Anticipating, patiently waiting
For the Spirit to move across the land 
His people are kneeling; they are on their knees in prayer
His people are bringing their each and every care
In prayer believing, His grace receiving
And the Spirit we know is always there 
We know, oh yes, we know
The Spirit is moving across the land
We bow, oh yes, we bow
Before the works of the Master's mighty hand 
His people are praising His holy name on high
His people on wings, on wings of love will fly
And we will praise Him, redeemed we raise Him
So that others may see His awesome might 
Before the works of the Master's mighty hand 

Darkness may o’ertake me and my song forsake me,
But alone I never shall be;
For the Friend beside me promised He would guide me,
And will keep His promise to me.
He will keep his promise to me,
All the way with me He will go;
He has never broken any promise spoken;
He will keep His promise, I know.
Should misfortune meet me, friends may fail to greet me,
But if true to Jesus I stay
He will still uphold me, let His love enfold me
Every dreary mile of the way.
How the thought enthralls me, that whate’er befalls me
One will always love me the same;
Not a trial ever causes Him to sever
From the ones who honor His Name.

God made Him who had no sin
So that we might become His Righteousness
Instead of ourselves He offered Him
So that we might become His Righteousness
So that we might become His Righteousness
So that we might become His Righteousness
Holy God was offered for us
So that we might become His Righteousness
So that we might become His Righteousness
It's hard to believe we can be spiritually well
So that we might become His Righteousness
The loving God tasted the essence of hell
So that we might become His Righteousness
So that we might become His Righteousness
So that we might become His Righteousness
Holy God was offered for us
So that we might become His Righteousness
God in the flesh lived as a man
Will of the Father, fulfilling His plan
Jesus condemned, taking our place
Now we are in Him and we'll see His face
Holy God was offered for us
So that we might become His Righteousness (Become His Righteousness)
So that we might become His Righteousness (Become His Righteousness)
We might become His Righteousness (Become His Righteousness) (

I can do all things through Christ
Who gives me strength;
But sometimes I wonder
What He can do through me?
No great success to show
No glory on my own
Yet, in my weakness
He is there to let me know.
His strength is perfect
When our strength is gone.
He'll carry us
When we can't carry on.
Raised in His power
The weak become strong.
His strength is perfect
His strength is perfect.
We can only know
The power That He holds
When we truly see
How deep our weakness goes;
His strength in us begins
Where ours comes to an end
He hears our humble cry
And proves again.

I cannot tell when the thunders peal,
How fiercely the storm may rage,
Nor how dense are the shades of the night that steal
O’er the path of my pilgrimage;
But I know, with my Savior always near,
As that night on the Galilee,
The tempest will cease when His voice I hear,
And the darkest shadows flee.
I cannot see through the darkest clouds
His image so wondrous fair,
And forget sometimes, when the gloom enshrouds,
The mansion awaiting there;
But if on the wings of faith I soar,
In the strength of His word alone,
My soul can drink till I want no more,
From fountains of love unknown.
I cannot drink one draught of pain
From the cup once drained for me,
Or bear the heat on the desert plain,
Nor the grief of Gethsemane;
But I know, if His cross I meekly bear,
If I labor, and watch, and pray,
His suff’rings I a part may share
From thorns in the narrow way.
I cannot see for the veil between
The beautiful gates ajar,
The streets of gold, and the living green,
On the banks of the river there;
But I know, somewhere, on that heavenly strand,
Is a mansion, and robe, and crown,
Preserved by the Savior’s loving hand
Till my work on earth is done.

His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet, is heard through the shadows of 
death;
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet, the air is perfumed with His breath.
His lips as the fountain of righteousness flow, that waters the garden of grace,
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know, and bask in the smiles of 
His face.
O! Thou in Whose presence my soul takes delight, on Whom in affliction I call;
My Comfort by day, and my Song in the night, my Hope, my Salvation, my All—
Where dost Thou at noontide resort with Thy sheep, to feed on the pastures of 
love?
Say, why in the valley of death should I weep, or ’lone in the wilderness rove?
O! why should I wander an alien from thee, and cry in the desert for bread?
Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see, and smile at the tears I have 
shed.
Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen the Star that on Israel shone?
Say if in your tents my Beloved hath been, and where, with His flock, is He 
gone?
“What is thy Beloved, thou dignified fair? What excellent beauties hath He?
His charms and perfections be pleased to declare, that we may embrace Him with 
thee."
This is my Beloved, His form is divine; His vestments shed odor around;
The locks on His head are as grapes on the vine, when autumn with plenty is 
crowned.
The roses of Sharon, the lilies that grow in the vales, on the banks of the 
streams
On His cheeks in the beauty of excellence blow; His eyes are as quivers of 
beams.
His voice as the sound of the dulcimer sweet is heard through the shadows of 
death;
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet, the air is perfumed with His breath.

Would you live for Jesus, and be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your burden, carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee.
His power can make you what you ought to be;
His blood can cleanse your heart and make you free;
His love can fill your soul, and you will see
’Twas best for Him to have His way with thee.
Would you have Him make you free, and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you, so that you can never fall?
Let Him have His way with thee.
Would you in His kingdom find a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true in providential test?
Would you in His service labor always at your best?
Let Him have His way with thee.

His wide dominion shall extend
From sea to utmost sea,
And unto earth’s remotest bounds
His peaceful rule shall be.
The tribes that in the desert dwell
Shall bow before His throne;
His enemies shall be subdued,
And He shall rule alone.
The kings shall come from distant lands
And islands of the sea;
Oblations they shall bring to Him
And wait on bended knee.
Yea, all the kings shall bow to Him,
His rule all nations hail;
He will regard the poor man’s cry
When other helpers fail.
The poor and needy He shall spare,
And save their souls from fear;
He shall redeem them from all wrong,
Their life to Him is dear.
So they shall live and bring to Him
Their gifts of finest gold;
For Him shall constant prayer be made,
His praise each day be told.

There’s pow’r, mighty pow’r in the word of the King;
He speaks, and the captive is free;
The lips of the dumb with rejoicing shall sing;
O speak, blessed Savior, to me!
O the pow’r, mighty pow’r,
In the word of my Savior and King!
O the pow’r, mighty pow’r!
For Jesus salvation shall bring.
There’s pow’r, mighty pow’r in the pardoning word;
He said, “Go, and sin now no more!"
How sweet was the hour when forgiveness I heard,
And mercy had opened the door!
There’s pow’r, mighty pow’r in the word of the Lord,
And strength He will give, when we pray,
To follow His footsteps, His goodness record,
And walk in love’s beautiful way.

What wonderful words in the Gospel of grace
Our loving Redeemer has giv’n!
How happy are they who in spirit are pure,
For theirs is the kingdom of Heav’n!
Tho’ all that is earthly will fade,
And vanish away from our view,
We know that as sure as the Savior lives,
The words He has spoken are true.
He maketh the lilies to bloom in the field,
And shelters the bird in its nest;
He calleth the weary to come unto Him,
And find the sweet blessing of rest.
To those that are thirsting and longing for Him,
The water of life He will give;
And they that with patience endure to the end,
Forever in glory shall live.
Then why are we fearful, and where is our faith?
His own He will never forsake;
And tho’ He may lead them where waters are deep,
His promise He never will break.

The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me down to lie
In pastures green He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.
His yoke is easy; His burden is light.
I’ve found it so; I’ve found it so.
He leadeth me by day and by night
Where living waters flow.
My soul crieth out: “Restore me again,
And give me the strength to take
The narrow path of righteousness,
E’en for His own Name’s sake."
Yea, tho’ I should walk the valley of death,
Yet why should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

He brought me to his banqueting table
(Brought me to his banqueting table)
He brought me to his banqueting table
(Brought me to his banqueting table)
And His banner over me is love
I am my beloved's and He is mine
(I am my beloved's and He is mine)
Yes, I am my beloved's and He is mine
(I am my beloved's and He is mine)
And His banner over me is love
Yes, His banner over me is love
And we can feel the love of God in this place
We believe your goodness we receive Your grace
We delight ourselves at Your table, oh God
You do all things well, just look at our lives

His be the Victor's Name
Who fought the fight alone;
Triumphant saints no honor claim;
Their conquest was His own.
By weakness and defeat
He won the reed and crown;
Trod all the foes beneath His feet
By being trodden down.
He hell in hell laid low;
Made sin, He sin o'erthrew;
Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,
And death, by dying, slew.
What tho' the'accuser roar
Of ills that I have done;
I know them well, and thousands more;
Jehovah findeth none.
Bless, bless the Conqu'ror slain,
Slain by divine decree!
Who lived, who died, who lives again,
For thee, my soul, for thee.

Give thanks unto the Lord for He is good
Give thanks unto the Lord His mercy endures
Give thanks unto the Lord for He is good
Give thanks unto the Lord His mercy endures
And His loving kindness will last forever
His love is endless and has no measure
The Lord is our strength and our salvation
And He will remain our unending grace
The Lord is our strength and our salvation
And He will remain our unending grace
Lord we give thanks to You
Forever Your love will endure
Lord we give thanks to You
Forever Your love will endur.

Before the voice of Heaven spoke, before the earth was framed,
Within the mighty heart of God were we, His loved ones, named.
That in the pleasure of His will as He alone had planned,
We might thro' Him be full redeemed and in His presence stand.
So God within His kingdom has reserved for us a place,
That we might praise the glory of His rich, abundant grace.
Forgiven by the Saviour's grace, and ransomed by His love,
With wonder we behold the will of Him who reigns above
That someday, in a mighty choir may all creation sing
And worship with a swelling sound their great, eternal King.
So heavens' beings shall arise and men from ev'ry place
To praise the matchless glory of His rich, abundant grace.
O Spirit of immortal truth, interpreter divine,
Salvation's holy evidence, redemption's sacred sign.
Renew our cold and sinful hearts, our inner zeal inspire;
Thou token of eternal hope, descend in holy fire!
So guide us in the truth of God until we see His face
And praise Him for the glory of His rich, abundant grace.

Hold fast to the Savior, He loves you still,
Hold fast to the promise He will fulfill;
Hold fast, ever trusting you shall receive,
Hold fast, do not waver, His Word believe.
Hold fast, hold fast,
Hold to the Savior, He’s all in all;
Hold fast, hold fast,
Hold fast to the promise, you’ll never fall.
Hold fast to your covenant made with God,
And trust for the cleansing in Jesus’ blood;
Hold fast for the strength you shall need in life,
He surely will help you amid the strife.
Hold fast, never doubting, withstand the foe,
Put on the whole armor and onward go;
Determined to conquer in Jesus’ might,
Ne’er run from a battle, but face the fight.
Hold fast for that beautiful land in view,
Hold fast for the crown that’s awaiting you;
Hold fast for the meeting of loved ones there,
Hold fast for the bliss they have gone to share.

Oh, spirit, o’erwhelmed by thy failures and fears,
Look up to thy Lord, though with trembling and tears;
Weak Faith, to thy call seem the heav’ns only dumb?
To thee is the message, “Hold fast till I come."
Hold fast till I come, hold fast till I come,
A bright crown awaits thee; Hold fast till I come.
Hold fast when the world would allure thee to sin;
Hold fast when the tempter assails from within;
In sunshine or sadness, in gain or in loss,
To falter were madness; oh, cling to the cross.
Thy Savior is coming in tenderest love,
To make up His jewels and bear them above:
Oh, child, in thine anguish, despairing or dumb,
Remember the message, “Hold fast till I come."

Ho, my comrades! see the signal waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing, victory is nigh.
“Hold the fort, for I am coming," Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to Heaven, “By Thy grace we will."
See the mighty host advancing, Satan leading on;
Mighty ones around us falling, courage almost gone!
See the glorious banner waving! Hear the trumpet blow!
In our Leader’s Name we triumph over ev’ry foe.
Fierce and long the battle rages, but our help is near;
Onward comes our great Commander, cheer, my comrades, cheer!

Hold Thou my hand; so weak I am, and helpless,
I dare not take one step without Thy aid;
Hold Thou my hand; for then, O loving Savior,
No dread of ill shall make my soul afraid.
Hold Thou my hand, and closer, closer draw me
To Thy dear self—my hope, my joy, my all;
Hold Thou my hand, lest haply I should wander,
And, missing Thee, my trembling feet should fall.
Hold Thou my hand; the way is dark before me
Without the sunlight of Thy face divine;
But when by faith I catch its radiant glory,
What heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine!
Hold Thou my hand, that when I reach the margin
Of that lone river Thou didst cross for me,
A heavenly light may flash along its waters,
And every wave like crystal bright shall be.

Time is filled with swift transition,
Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God’s unchanging hand.
Hold to God’s unchanging hand,
Hold to God’s unchanging hand;
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God’s unchanging hand.
Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring,
If by earthly friends forsaken
Still more closely to Him cling.
Covet not this world’s vain riches
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heav’nly treasures,
They will never pass away.
When your journey is completed,
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory
Your enraptured soul will view.

Hold up the grand old Bible to the people!
Deny it or neglect it never!
Unfailing it has stood the test of ages,
And it shall stand unchanged forever!
O blessed book, the only book,
The pow’rs of earth can change it never!
The test of fire and flood through ages it hath stood,
And it shall stand unchanged forever.
Hold up the grand old Bible and proclaim it
The Word of God by prophets spoken;
His seal imprinted glows upon its pages,
And not a precept can be broken.
Hold up the grand old Bible of our fathers,
And send it unto ev’ry nation;
It is the cloud by day, the fire in darkness,
That lights the way unto salvation.
Hold up the grand old Bible, proudly own it,
Believe, and search its sacred pages;
There you may find the way of life eternal—
Immortal life through endless ages.

There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
They say that anger is just love disappointed
They say that love is just a state of mind
But all this fightin' over who will be anointed
Oh how can people be so blind
Oh they tell me there's a place over yonder
Cool water running through the burning sand
Until we learn to love one another
We will never reach the Promised Land
and (together)
There's a hole in the world tonight (hold in the world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight (there's a hole, there's a hole in the 
world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (there's a hole)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow (don't let there be a hole)
There's a hole in the world tonight (hey)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (oh, there's a cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (there's a hole in the world tonight)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow (no no no, no no no)
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

Beautiful holiness! theme of the Bible,
Filling my heart with its riches of grace;
Cleansing and keeping me ever from evil,
Fitting my soul for that heavenly place.
Beautiful holiness! fair as the morning,
Sparkling with jewels of purity bright;
Rubies of grace in their splendid adorning,
Cover me here as I walk in the light.
Beautiful holiness! coming from heaven,
Likeness of God and the angels above;
Jesus, the way, and the Bible, are given—
Wonderful favor through infinite love! 
Beautiful holiness! blissful, eternal,
Surely without it no man seeth God;
It will prepare us for glories immortal—
This is the way our dear Savior hath trod.

Holiness dwells in the temple of God,
Adorning its walls within;
Those who would enter this blessed abode
Must turn from the way of sin.
Holiness, holiness unto the Lord!
Ever in triumph we’ll sing,
Standing secure on the rock of His word—
Holiness unto our King! 
Holiness reigns in the hearts of the saints,
A welcome, abiding guest,
Giving them freedom from sinful restraints,
Affording supernal rest.
Jesus has promised His power of old
To cleanse us from every sin,
Purging the dross and refining the gold,
And taking away the tin.
Jesus lived holy while walking below,
The tempter He overcame:
Those who at last into heaven would go
Must live in this world the same.
Holiness, holiness unto the Lord!
Is carved on the “horses bells";
Paradise pure in our hearts is restored
When holiness in us dwells.

Holiness becomes Thy house,
’Tis Thou who dost dwell in light;
Thou begirt with majesty,
Gird us with truth,
And with Thy great might.
Send Thou forth Thy power and love,
In beauty of holiness;
We would here commune with Thee,
Eternal God,
Be Thou near to bless.
O supreme and perfect One,
O Lord, praise to Thee is due;
Clothe us in the grace of love,
Maintain Thy church,
To Thy service true.

Holy! Holy! Holy is the Lord!
The all powerful God
Holy! Holy! Holy is the Lord!
Who was and is and soon will be coming
Who was and is and soon will be coming 
Our Lord and our God you are worthy
To receive glory, honor, and power
You created all things and by your choice
Everything exists by your hand 
Singing.
Holy! Holy! Holy is the Lord!
The all powerful God (Holy is the Lord)
Holy! Holy! Holy is the Lord!
Who was and is and soon will be coming (coming Lord)
Who was and is and soon will be coming (coming Lord, coming Lord, coming Lord, 
coming Lord) 
To the One who sits on the heavenly throne
And to the Holy Lamb that was slain
Be praises and honor and glory
And power forever and ever! 
Singing.
Lord we will pray in your Spirit
And rejoice in this vision of heaven
As we stand at your throne and sing praises
With the saved of all times and all nations 
Singing.

Holy and awesome is Your name
Splendid, majestic are all Your ways
Gracious, compassionate are You Lord
Your praise endures forevermore
Your praise endures forevermore
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
To receive power and riches and strength
Honor and glory and blessings are Yours
We'll sing Your praise forevermore
We'll sing Your praise forevermore
(

Holy and reverend is the Name
Of our eternal King:
Thrice holy Lord, the angels cry;
Thrice holy, let us sing.
Heaven’s brightest lamps with Him compared,
How mean they look and dim!
The fairest angels have their spots,
When once compared with Him.
Holy is He in all his works,
And truth is His delight;
But sinners and their wicked ways
Shall perish from His sight.
The deepest reverence of the mind,
Pay, O my soul, to God;
Lift with thy hands a holy heart
To His sublime abode.
With sacred awe pronounce His Name,
Whom words nor thoughts can reach;
A broken heart shall please Him more
Than the best forms of speech.
Thou holy God! preserve my soul
From all pollution free;
The pure in heart are Thy delight,
And they Thy face shall see.

Holy as Thou, O Lord, is none;
Thy holiness is all Thine own;
A drop of that unbounded sea
Is ours—a drop derived from Thee.
And when Thy purity we share,
Thine only glory we declare;
And, humbled into nothing, own,
Holy and pure is God alone.
Sole, self-existing God and Lord,
By all Thy heav’nly hosts adored,
Let all on earth bow down to Thee,
And own Thy peerless majesty.
Thy power unparalleled confess,
Established on the Rock of peace;
The Rock that never shall remove,
The Rock of pure, almighty, love.

Holy Bible, Book divine,
Precious treasure, thou art mine;
Mine to tell me whence I came;
Mine to teach me what I am.
Mine to chide me when I rove;
Mine to show a Savior’s love;
Mine thou art to guide and guard;
Mine to punish or reward.
Mine to comfort in distress;
Suffering in this wilderness;
Mine to show, by living faith,
Man can triumph over death.
Mine to tell of joys to come,
And the rebel sinner’s doom;
O thou holy Book divine,
Precious treasure, thou art mine.
Holy Bible, book Divine,
Precious treasure, thou art mine;
Mine to tell me whence I came;
Mine to teach me what I am.
Mine to chide me when I rove;
Mine to shew a Saviour’s love;
Mine art thou to guide my feet;
Mine to judge, condemn, acquit.
Mine to comfort in distress;
If the Holy Spirit bless;
Mine to shew, by living faith,
Man can triumph over death.
Mine to tell of joys to come,
And the rebel sinner’s doom;
Holy Bible, book Divine,
Precious treasure, thou art mine.

Holy Father, hear me;
thou art my defender,
be thou ever near me,
loving, true and tender.
Jesus, blessed Savior,
Lord of life and glory,
grant me now thy favor
as I kneel before thee.
Comforter benignest,
who abiding in me
all my need divinest,
move me, draw me, win me.
Holy, holy, holy,
come, and leave me never,
thine abode most lowly,
only thine for ever.

Holy Father, bless us
As the day we close,
And the night’s refreshing
Grant us in repose.
All the day Thy presence
Made our hearts to burn,
As we heard Thy counsel,
Felt Thy love’s concern.
So tonight we pray Thee
Leave us not alone;
But through light and shadow
Keep us as Thine own.
Grant to us in slumber
To be very near,
In Thy goodness quelling
Needless doubt and fear.
When at length the dawning
Sweeps the night away,
Help us rise triumphant,
Worthy of the day.

Holy Father, cheer our way
With Thy love’s perpetual ray;
Grant us every closing day
Light at evening time.
Holy Savior, calm our fears
When earth’s brightness disappears;
Grant us in our later years
Light at evening time.
Holy Spirit, be Thou nigh
When in mortal pains we lie;
Grant us, as we come to die,
Light at evening time.
Holy, blessed Trinity,
Darkness is not dark to Thee;
Those Thou keepest always see
Light at evening time.

Holy Father, God almighty,
Holy Jesus, God adored,
Holy Spirit, God of comfort,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!
All our praises rise before You,
God who made all that exists.
As You did with ancient offerings,
Send Your Spirit on our gifts.
You gave us Your body, Jesus,
On the night You were betrayed—
Bread of heaven, earthly feasting—
Sacrifice for sins now paid.
And You gave Your blood to nourish
Body, spirit and the soul—
Cup of blessing that did heal us—
Liquid that did make us whole.
We recall Your incarnation!
We recall Your earthly life!
We recall Your crucifixion
Full of agony and strife!
We recall Your resurrection
From the grave though sealed with stone!
This Your victory over death, Lord,
Gives us promise for our own.
And recalling Your ascension,
We entreat You and implore
That You soon return and take us
To be with You evermore!
Send Your Spirit to be with us
As we pilgrim through this life.
Keep your church and all our loved ones
From all evil and all strife.
With the saints and with the angels
We are longing, Lord, to be,
Where with praise and adoration,
Our Redeemer we shall see.
Through and with and in Christ Jesus,
In the Spirit’s unity,
Be all honor to the Father
Now and through eternity!

Holy Father, great Creator,
Source of mercy, love and peace,
Look upon the Mediator,
Clothe us with His righteousness;
Heav’nly Father, heav’nly Father,
Through the Savior hear and bless!
Holy Jesus, Lord of glory,
Whom angelic hosts proclaim,
While we hear Thy wondrous story,
Meet and worship in Thy Name,
Dear Redeemer, dear Redeemer,
In our hearts Thy peace proclaim.
Holy Spirit, Sanctifier,
Come with unction from above,
Raise our hearts to raptures higher,
Fill them with the Savior’s love.
Source of comfort, source of comfort,
Cheer us with the Savior’s love.
God the Lord, through every nation
Let Thy wondrous mercies shine,
In the song of Thy salvation
Every tongue and race combine,
Great Jehovah, great Jehovah,
Form our hearts and make them Thine.

Holy Father, hear my cry;
Holy Savior, bend Thine ear;
Holy Spirit, come Thou nigh;
Father, Savior, Spirit, hear.
Father, save me from my sin;
Savior, I Thy mercy crave;
Gracious Spirit, make me clean:
Father, Savior, Spirit, save.
Father, let me taste Thy love;
Savior, fill my soul with peace;
Spirit, come my heart to move:
Father, Son, and Spirit, bless.
Father, Son, and Spirit—Thou
One Jehovah, shed abroad
All Thy grace within me now;
Be my Father and my God.

Holy Father, in Thy mercy,
Hear our anxious prayer.
Keep our loved ones, now far distant,
’Neath Thy care.
Jesus, Savior, let Thy presence
Be their light and guide;
Keep, oh, keep them, in their weakness,
At Thy side.
When in sorrow, when in danger,
When in loneliness,
In Thy love look down and comfort
Their distress.
May the joy of Thy salvation
Be their strength and stay;
May they love and may they praise Thee
Day by day.
Holy Spirit, let Thy teaching
Sanctify their life;
Send Thy grace, that they may conquer
In the strife.
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
God the One in Three,
Bless them, guide them, save them, keep them
Near to Thee.

Holy Father, Thou hast given
Holy truth from highest heaven;
Words of counsel wise and pure,
Words of promise bright and sure;
Light that guides us back to Thee,
Back to peace and purity.
Clearer than the sun at noon,
Fairer than the silver moon,
Through the clouds and through the night,
Ever shines this heavenly light;
Help us, Lord, to lift our eyes
Take its guidance and be wise.
Here the wisdom from above
Beaming holiness and love,
Kindling hope, dispelling fear,
Shines to save; for Christ is here:
Knowing, trusting Him, we come
From our wanderings gladly home.
Blessed Savior, Light divine,
Thou hast bid us rise and shine;
Grant Thy grace, and we shall be
Children of the day in Thee,
Showing all around the road
Back to life, and love, and God.

Sweet fellowship, thy crystal tide,
Flows joyful in our souls;
Baptized in one, naught can divide,
While heav’nly peace controls.
O brethren, how our spirits blend
In fellowship so dear;
Though sundered far by God’s command,
We feel you still so near.
God over all, and through us all,
In floods of blissful light,
Is fellowship in every soul
That’s pure in heaven’s sight.
O fellowship, my brethren dear,
In bonds of perfect love;
How blest the seal of union here
With all the saints above! 
This fellowship with Father, Son,
And all who love the Lord,
Is heaven here on earth begun,
’Tis Paradise restored.

Holy Ghost, Illuminator,
shed thy beams upon eyes,
help us to look up with Stephen,
and to see, beyond the skies,
where the Son of Man in glory
standing is at God's right hand,
beckoning on his martyr army,
succoring his faithful band.
See him, who is gone before us,
heavenly mansions to prepare;
see him, who is ever pleading
for us with prevailing prayer;
see him, who with sound of trumpet
and with his angelic train,
summoning the world to judgment,
on the clouds will come again.
Lift us up from earth to heaven,
give us wings of faith and love,
gales of holy aspirations
wafting us to realms above;
that, with hearts and minds uplifted,
we with Christ our Lord may dwell,
where he sits enthroned in glory
in his heavenly citadel.
So at last, when he appeareth,
we from out our graves may spring,
with our youth renewed like eagles,
flocking round our heavenly King,
caught up on the clouds of heaven,
and may meet him in the air,
rise to realms where he is reigning,
and may reign for ever there.
Glory be to God the Father,
glory be to God the Son,
dying, risen, ascending for us,
who the heavenly realm has won.
Glory to the Holy Spirit;
to One God in Persons Three
glory both in earth and heaven,
glory, endless glory be.

Holy God, we show forth here
Jesus' death our hearts to clear,
Jesus' life our life to be,
Jesus' love the world to free.
Stay the faithful, win the strayed,
bless the living and the dead,
Father, lead us, 
Savior, feed us,
Spirit, be our store,
now and evermore.
Lord, unite us every one
each to other, through thy Son;
join us truly heart to heart,
let us ne'er be drawn apart:
all one Bread, one Body we,
bound by love to all and thee.
Blessed Master,
bind us faster;
in thy love divine,
love we thee and thine.

Holy Ghost, with light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine;
Chase the shade of night away,
Turn my darkness into day.
Let me see my Savior’s face,
Let me all His beauties trace;
Show those glorious truths to me
Which are only known to Thee.
Holy Ghost, with power divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long has sin, without control,
Held dominion o’er my soul.
Holy Ghost, with joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
Bid my many woes depart,
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.
Holy Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine;
Cast down every idol throne,
Reign supreme, and reign alone.
See, to Thee I yield my heart,
Shed Thy life through every part;
A pure temple I would be,
Wholly dedicate to Thee.

Holy Ghost, come down upon Thy children,
Give us grace and make us Thine;
Thy tender fires within us kindle,
Blessed Spirit, Dove divine.
For all within us good and holy
Is from Thee, Thy precious gift;
In all our joys, in all our sorrows,
Wistful hearts to Thee we lift.
For Thou to us art more than Father,
More than sister, in Thy love,
So gentle, patient, and forbearing,
Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove.
O we have grieved Thee, gracious Spirit!
Wayward, wanton, cold are we;
And still our sins, new every morning,
Never yet have wearied Thee.
Ah! Sweet Consoler, though we cannot
Love Thee as Thou lovest us,
Yet if Thou deign’st our hearts to kindle
They will not be always thus.
With hearts so vile how dare we venture,
King of kings, to love Thee so?
And how canst Thou, with such compassion,
Bear so long with things so low?

Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness;
Pierce the clouds of nature’s night;
Come, great Source of joy and gladness,
Breathe Your life, and spread Your light.
From the height which knows no measure,
As a gracious shower descend,
Bringing down the richest treasure
Man can wish, or God can send.
Author of the new creation,
Come with blessing and with power.
Make our hearts your habitation;
On our souls Your graces shower.
Hear, O hear our supplication,
Blessed Spirit, God of peace!
Rest upon this congregation,
With the fullness of Your grace.

Holy Ghost, my Comforter,
Now from highest Heaven appear,
Shed Thy gracious radiance here.
Thou the heart’s most precious Guest,
Thou of comforters the best,
Give to us, o’erladen, rest.
Blessed Sun of grace, o’er all
Faithful hearts who on Thee call
Let Thy light and solace fall.
What without Thy aid is wrought,
Skillful deed or wisest thought,
God will count but vain and naught.
Cleanse us, Lord, from sinful stain,
On the parched spirit rain,
Heal the wounded of its pain.
Bend the stubborn will to Thine,
Melt the cold with fire divine,
Erring hearts to right incline.
Grant us, Lord, who cry to Thee,
Steadfast in the faith to be,
Give Thy gift of charity.
May we live in holiness,
And in death find happiness,
And abide with Thee in bliss!

Holy God, we praise Thy Name;
Lord of all, we bow before Thee!
All on earth Thy scepter claim,
All in Heaven above adore Thee;
Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.
Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.
Lo! the apostolic train
Join the sacred Name to hallow;
Prophets swell the loud ,
And the white robed martyrs follow;
And from morn to set of sun,
Through the Church the song goes on.
Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim Thee;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord!
Sing, O ye people, gladly adore Him;
Let the mountains tremble at His word;
Let the hills be joyful before Him;
Mighty in wisdom, boundless in mercy,
Great is Jehovah, King over all.
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord!
Let the hills be joyful before Him.
Praise Him, praise Him! shout aloud for joy,
Watchman of Zion, herald the story;
Sin and death His kingdom shall destroy;
All the earth shall sing of His glory;
Praise Him, ye angels, ye who behold Him,
Robed in His splendor, matchless, divine.
King eternal, blessed be His Name!
So may His children gladly adore Him;
When in Heav’n we join the happy strain,
When we cast our bright crowns before Him;
There in His likeness joyful awaking,
There we shall see Him, there we shall sing:

Holy, holy, holy Lord,
God the Father, and the Word,
God the Comforter, receive
Blessings more than we can give!
Mixed with those beyond the sky,
Chanters to the Lord Most High,
We our hearts and voices raise,
Echoing Thy eternal praise.
One, inexplicably Three,
Three, in simplest Unity,
God, incline Thy gracious ear,
Us, Thy lisping creatures, hear!
Thee while man, the earth-born, sings,
Angels shrink within their wings;
Prostrate seraphim above
Breathe unutterable love.
Happy they who never rest,
With Thy heavenly presence blest!
They the heights of glory see,
Sound the depths of Deity.
Fain with them our souls would vie,
Sink as low, and mount as high;
Fall o’erwhelmed with love, or soar,
Shout, or silently adore.

Holy, holy, holy, Lord
God of Hosts, eternal King,
By the heavens and earth adored!
Angels and archangels sing,
Chanting everlastingly
To the blessed Trinity.
Since by Thee were all things made,
And in Thee do all things live,
Be to Thee all honor paid;
Praise to Thee let all things give;
Singing everlastingly
To the blessed Trinity.
Thousands, tens of thousands, stand,
Spirits blest, before Thy throne,
Speeding thence at Thy command,
And, when Thy behests are done,
Singing everlastingly
To the blessed Trinity.
Cherubim and seraphim
Veil their faces with their wings;
Eyes of angels are too dim
To behold the King of kings,
While they sing eternally
To the blessed Trinity.
Thee apostles, prophets thee,
Thee the noble martyr band,
Praise with solemn jubilee;
Thee, the church in every land;
Singing everlastingly
To the blessed Trinity.
Hallelujah! Lord, to Thee
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Godhead one, and Persons three,
Join we with the heavenly host,
Singing everlastingly
To the blessed Trinity.

Holy, holy, holy Lord
God of Hosts! When Heav’n and earth,
Out of darkness, at Thy Word,
Issued into glorious birth,
All Thy works before Thee stood,
And Thine eye beheld them good,
While they sang with sweet accord,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord!
Holy, holy, holy! Thee
One Jehovah evermore,
Father, Son, and Spirit, we
Dust and ashes, would adore;
Lightly by the world esteemed,
From that world by Thee redeemed,
Sing we here with glad accord,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!
Holy, holy, holy! All
Heaven’s triumphant choirs shall sing
When the ransomed nations fall
At the footstool of their King:
Then shall saints and seraphim,
Hearts and voices, swell one hymn,
Round the throne with full accord,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!

Holy, holy, holy Lord
God in Heav’n—on earth adored;
Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, with Them One.
Lord, Creator of all things,
God of prophets, priests and kings:
When th’appointed time had come,
You sent us Your only Son.
Send upon our gifts this day
Blessings from Your throne, we pray.
May Your Spirit be outpoured
At this entrance of the Lord.
Let this bread and wine become
Flesh and Blood of Your dear Son,
That we may united be
With our Lord eternally.
On the night He was betrayed,
As the evening sun did fade,
Our Lord Jesus Christ took bread,
Giving thanks, blessed it and said:
“This, My Body, is for you,
And My Blood—the Cov’nant New.
Eat and drink this sacrament;
My gift is your nourishment."
Jesus Christ, incarnate One,
Son of God and Mary’s son,
We recall Your humble birth:
King of Heav’n and Lord of earth!
We recall Your pain and grief,
Endless anguish, no relief,
When upon that tree You died
For the Church, Your chosen Bride.
But no grave, the Lord, could hold;
Hence the stone away was rolled,
When the resurrected Lord
Rose so that He might award
Victory over death and grave
To those whom He came to save.
Now in heaven He shall reign
’Til we see Him come again.
Send to us Your Spirit, Lord;
By His presence be outpoured
Grace on grace and love on love—
Every blessing from above.
Bless Your Church on earth; preserve
All her leaders as they serve.
Be with all for whom we pray
As we intercede this day.
Our hearts, longing from within,
Ache for freedom from our sin.
In Your mercy, hear our cry
To be with Your saints on high.
God our Father and the Son
And the Spirit, with Them One:
You we honor and adore
With our praises evermore.

There is singing up in Heaven such as we have never known,
Where the angels sing the praises of the Lamb upon the throne,
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful, and their voices always clear,
O that we might be more like them while we serve the Master here!
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption’s story, they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys that our salvation brings.
But I hear another anthem, blending voices clear and strong,
“Unto Him Who hath redeemed us and hath bought us," is the song;
We have come through tribulation to this land so fair and bright,
In the fountain freely flowing He hath made our garments white.
Then the angels stand and listen, for they cannot join the song,
Like the sound of many waters, by that happy, blood washed throng,
For they sing about great trials, battles fought and vict’ries won,
And they praise their great Redeemer, Who hath said to them, “Well done."
So, although I’m not an angel, yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed that the angels cannot share;
I will sing about my Savior, Who upon dark Calvary
Freely pardoned my transgressions, died to set a sinner free.

Holy Jesus, by thy passion,
by the woes which none can share,
borne in more than kingly fashion,
by thy love beyond compare:
Crucified, I turn to thee;
Son of Mary, plead for me.
By the treachery and trial,
by the blows and sore distress,
by desertion and denial,
by thine awful loneliness;
Crucified, I turn to thee;
Son of Mary, plead for me.
By thy look so sweet and lowly,
while they smote thee on the face,
by thy patience, calm and holy,
in the midst of keen disgrace:
Crucified, I turn to thee;
Son of Mary, plead for me.
By the hour of condemnation,
by the blood which trickled down,
when, for us and our salvation:
thou didst wear the robe and crown:
Crucified, I turn to thee;
Son of Mary, plead for me.
By the path of sorrows dreary,
by the cross, thy dreadful load,
by the pain, when, faint and weary,
thou didst sink upon the road:
Crucified, I turn to thee;
Son of Mary, plead for me.
By the spirit which could render
love for hate and good for ill,
by the mercy, sweet and tender,
poured upon thy murderers still:
Crucified, I turn to thee;
Son of Mary, plead for me.

Holy Joseph, dearest father,
To thy children's prayer incline,
Whilst we sing thy joys and sorrows,
And the glories which are thine.
How to praise thee, how to thank thee,
Blessed Saint we can not tell,
Favors countless hast thou given
Can we choose but love thee well?
Holy Joseph, dearest father,
To thy children's prayer incline,
Whilst we sing thy joys and sorrows,
And the glories which are thine.
Near to Jesus, near to Mary,
And kind father, near to thee,
Keep us while on earth we wander,
And in death our helper be.
Holy Joseph, dearest father,
To thy children's prayer incline,
Whilst we sing thy joys and sorrows,
And the glories which are thine.
Sing we Joseph, spouse of Mary,
And our mother's blessed friend,
Favors countless mercies constant,
Thou dost ever to us send.
Holy Joseph, dearest father,
To thy children's prayer incline,
Whilst we sing thy joys and sorrows,
And the glories which are thine.
We have prayed, and thou hast answered;
We have asked and thou hast given
Need we marvel Jesus tells us,
Joseph has the stores of heav'n?
Holy Joseph, dearest father,
To thy children's prayer incline,
Whilst we sing thy joys and sorrows,
And the glories which are thine.
One more favor we will ask thee,
Thou of all canst grant it best,
When we die be thou still near us,
Bring us safe to endless rest.
Holy Joseph, dearest father,
To thy children's prayer incline,
Whilst we sing thy joys and sorrows,
And the glories which are thine.

Holy Lamb, who Thee confess,
Followers of Thy holiness,
Thee they ever keep in view,
Ever ask, “What shall we do?"
Governed by Thy only will,
All Thy words we would fulfill,
Would in all Thy footsteps go,
Walk as Jesus walked below.
While Thou didst on earth appear,
Servant to Thy servants here,
Mindful of Thy place above,
All Thy life was prayer and love.
Such our whole employment be,
Works of faith and charity;
Works of love on man bestowed,
Secret intercourse with God.
Early in the temple met,
Let us still our Savior greet;
Nightly to the mount repair,
Join our praying pattern there.
There by wrestling faith obtain
Power to work for God again,
Power His image to retrieve,
Power, like Thee, our Lord, to live.
Vessels, instruments of grace,
Pass we thus our happy days
’Twixt the mount and multitude,
Doing or receiving good;
Glad to pray and labor on,
Till our earthly course is run,
Till we, on the sacred tree,
Bow the head and die like Thee.

Holy Lamb, who Thee receive,
Who in Thee begin to live,
Day and night they cry to Thee,
As Thou art, so let us be!
Jesu, see my panting breast!
See I pant in Thee to rest!
Gladly would I now be clean,
Cleanse me now from every sin.
Fix, O fix my wavering mind!
To Thy cross my spirit bind;
Earthly passions far remove,
Swallow up my soul in love.
Dust and ashes though we be,
Full of sin and misery,
Thine we are, Thou Son of God!
Take the purchase of Thy blood!
Who in heart on Thee believes,
He the atonement now receives,
He with joy beholds Thy face,
Triumphs in Thy pardoning grace.
See, ye sinners, see the flame,
Rising from the slaughtered Lamb,
Marks the new, the living way,
Leading to eternal day!
Jesus, when this light we see,
All our soul’s athirst for Thee;
When Thy quickening power we prove,
All our heart dissolves in love.
Boundless wisdom, power divine,
Love unspeakable are Thine:
Praise by all to Thee be giv’n,
Sons of earth, and hosts of Heav’n!

Holy, holy Lord
Holy, holy Lord
Holy, holy Lord
Holy, holy
Lord almighty
He's the Lord almighty
He's the Lord almighty
He's the Lord almighty 
Complete and powerful
Faithful and true
Loving and merciful
Perfect and sure 
Eternal deity (my Lord is holy)
Our King of kings (holy Lord)
Adorned in majesty (my Lord is holy)
Angels will sing 

Holy Lord God! I love Thy truth,
Nor dare Thy least commandment slight;
Yet pierced by sin, the serpent’s tooth,
I mourn the anguish of the bite.
But though the poison lurks within,
Hope bids me still with patience wait;
Till death shall set me free from sin,
Free from the only thing I hate.
Had I a throne above the rest,
Where angels and archangels dwell;
One sin, unslain, within my breast,
Would make that Heav’n as dark as hell.
The prisoner, sent to breathe fresh air,
And blessed with liberty again,
Would mourn, were he condemned to wear
One link of all his former chain.
But O! no foe invades the bliss,
When glory crowns the Christian’s head;
One view of Jesus as He is,
Will strike all sin forever dead.

Brethren, we have met to worship and adore the Lord our God;
Will you pray with all your power, while we try to preach the Word?
All is vain unless the Spirit of the Holy One comes down;
Brethren, pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.
Brethren, see poor sinners round you slumbering on the brink of woe;
Death is coming, hell is moving, can you bear to let them go?
See our fathers and our mothers, and our children sinking down;
Brethren, pray and holy manna will be showered all around.
Sisters, will you join and help us? Moses’ sister aided him;
Will you help the trembling mourners who are struggling hard with sin?
Tell them all about the Savior, tell them that He will be found;
Sisters, pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.
Is there a trembling jailer, seeking grace, and filled with tears?
Is there here a weeping Mary, pouring forth a flood of tears?
Brethren, join your cries to help them; sisters, let your prayers abound;
Pray, Oh pray that holy manna may be scattered all around.
Let us love our God supremely, let us love each other, too;
Let us love and pray for sinners, till our God makes all things new.
Then He’ll call us home to Heaven, at His table we’ll sit down;
Christ will gird Himself and serve us with sweet manna all around.

Holy offerings, rich and rare,
offerings of praise and prayer,
purer life and purpose high,
clasped hands, uplifted eye,
lowly acts of adoration
to the God of our salvation--
on his altar laid we leave them:
Christ, present them; God receive them.
Promises in sorrow made,
left, alas, too long unpaid;
fervent wishes, earnest thought,
never into action wrought--
long withheld, we now restore them,
on thy holy altar pour them:
there in trembling faith to leave them,
Christ, present them; God receive them.
Homage of each humble heart
ere we from thy house depart;
worship fervent, deep and high,
adoration, ecstasy;
all that childlike love can render
of devotion true and tender--
on thine altar laid we leave them:
Christ, present them; God receive them.
To the Father and the Son
and the Spirit, Three in One,
though our mortal weakness raise
offerings of imperfect praise,
yet with hearts bowed down most lowly,
crying, Holy, holy, holy,
on thine altar laid we leave them:
Christ, present them; God receive them.

Holy Sabbath, day of rest;
By our great Redeemer blest;
When in majesty He rose,
More than conqueror o’er His foes.
Softly now we hear Him say,
“Turn from earthly toil away;
Let your pray’rs to Heaven ascend;
I will keep you to the end."
Day of worship, hallowed hour,
May the Spirit’s quick’ning pow’r
Give us grace and strength anew,
While our journey we pursue.
Holy Sabbath, may thy light,
Pure and holy, calm and bright,
Lift our hearts to God above,
Spring of joy, of life, of love.

The holy Son of God most high,
For love of Adam’s lapsed race,
Quit the sweet pleasures of the sky
To bring us to that happy place.
His robes of light He laid aside,
Which did His majesty adorn,
And the frail state of mortals tried,
In human flesh and figure born.
Whole choirs of angels loudly sing
The mystery of His sacred birth,
And the blest news to shepherds bring,
Filling their watchful souls with mirth.
The Son of God thus man became,
That men the sons of God might be,
And by their second birth regain
A likeness to His deity.

Holy Savior! we adore Thee,
Seated on the throne of God,
While the heavenly hosts before Thee
Gladly sing Thy praise aloud.
“Thou art worthy!
We are ransomed by Thy blood."
Savior! though the world despised Thee,
Though Thou here wast crucified,
Yet the Father’s glory raised Thee,
Lord of all creation wide;
“Thou art worthy!
We shall live, for Thou hast died."
Haste the day of thy returning
With Thy ransomed church to reign;
Then shall end our days of mourning,
We shall sing with rapture then,
“Thou art worthy!
Come, Lord Jesus, come, Amen."

The Spirit, oh, sinner,
In mercy doth move,
Thy heart, so long hardened,
Of sin to reprove;
Resist not the Spirit,
Nor longer delay;
God’s gracious entreaties,
May end with today.
Oh, child of the kingdom,
From sin service cease:
Be filled with the Spirit,
With comfort and peace.
Oh, grieve not the Spirit,
Thy Teacher is He,
That Jesus, Thy Savior,
May glorified be.
Defiled is the temple,
Its beauty laid low,
On God’s holy altar
The embers faint glow.
By love yet rekindled,
A flame may be fanned;
Oh, quench not the Spirit,
The Lord is at hand.

Holy Spirit dwell in me
Touch my eyes that I might see
All your goodness grace and pow'r
Stay beside me ev'ry hour
Be my drink, be my living bread
Keep me sheltered, keep me fed
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit dwell in me 
Holy Spirit comfort me
Let my heart be one with Thee
When I'm worried soote my mind
Let me sweet contentment find
May I run this wicked race
Filled by your amazing grace
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit comfort me 
Holy Spirit rescue me
Set my soul completely free
Beside Jordan make my bed
In God's bosom lay my head
Let me live in a brand new place
See my blessed Savior's face
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit rescue me 
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit dwell in me 

Holy Spirit, gently come,
Raise us from our fallen state,
Fix thy everlasting home
In the hearts thou didst create,
Gift of God most high!
Visit every troubled breast,
Light and life and love supply,
Give our spirits perfect rest.
Heavenly unction from above,
Comforter of hearts that faint,
Fountain, life, and fire of love,
Hear and answer our complaint:
Thee we humbly pray,
Finger of the living God,
Now thy sevenfold gift display,
Shed our Saviour's love abroad.
Now thy quickening influence bring,
On our spirits sweetly move,
Open every mouth to sing
Jesus' everlasting love:
Lighten every heart;
Drive our enemies away,
Joy and peace to us impart,
Lead us in the heavenly way.
Take the things of Christ and show
What our Lord for us hath done;
May we God the Father know
Only in and through the Son:
Nothing will we fear,
Through the wilds and deserts driven,
While we feel thy presence near,
Witnessing our sins forgiven.
Glory be to God alone,
God whose hand created all!
Glory be to God the Son,
Who redeemed us from our fall!
To the Holy Ghost
Equal praise and glory be,
When the course of time is lost,
Lost in wide eternity!

Holy Spirit, Lord of love, 
thou who camest from above,
gifts of blessing to bestow 
on your waiting Church below,
once again in love draw near 
to thy servants gathered here.
From their bright baptismal day 
thou hast led them on their way.
When the sacred vow is made, 
when the hands are on them laid,
come in this most solemn hour 
with your strengthening gift of power.
Give them light thy truth to see: 
give them life to live for thee,
daily power to conquer sin,
patient faith, the crown to win.

Holy Spirit, rain down, rain down
Oh Comforter and Friend
How we need Your touch again
Holy Spirit, rain down, rain down
Let Your power fall, let Your voice be heard
Come and change our hearts as we stand on Your word
Holy Spirit, rain down
No eye has seen, no ear has heard
No mind can know what God has in store
So open up heaven, open it wide
Over Your church, and over our lives

Holy Spirit, storm of love,
break our self-protective walls.
Bring us out and show us why,
nakedly upon the cross,
open to the wind and sky,
Jesus waits and Jesus calls.
Show us, in his tortured flesh,
earth's Creator on display,
broken by affairs of state,
drinking horror, pain and grief,
arching in the winds of hate,
giving love and life away.
Show us how this dying love
entered, bore, and understood
all our deep, unconscious drives,
each exploiting, evil thread
woven through our nations' lives,
all our life apart from God.
Thus convicted, claimed, and called,
freed, as Christ we freely choose,
washed in love, reborn, renamed,
doing justice, knowing God,
may we witness unashamed,
confident to give good news:
News that Jesus is alive,
as his people of the Dove,
going out in praise and prayer,
meet the evils of our time
and the demons of despair
with forgiving, living love.

By the promise of the Father,
Comes the Spirit from on high,
Into hearts redeemed from evil,
By His pow’r to sanctify.
Holy Spirit, faithful Teacher,
In my trusting heart abide;
By Thy sacred, holy presence
Be my Comforter and Guide.
Reigning there without a rival,
Paradise is now restored;
Perfect peace, abiding pleasure,
Bliss the world cannot afford.
Pow’r to overcome He gives us,
Pow’r to reign through Jesus’ grace;
Holy boldness in each conflict,
Entrance to that heav’nly place.
Since the Comforter abideth,
Naught my spirit can molest;
I am sanctified and happy,
Sweet and peaceful is my rest.

Holy Spirit, come and shine
Sweetly in this heart of mine,
With Thy heavenly love and light;
Come, Thou Father of the poor,
Come, Thou Giver, great and sure;
Come, and make my spirit bright!
Best of all my helpers, Thou!
Dearest Guest that I can know,
Freshest Draught that I can find:
In my labor Thou art Peace,
Thou dost bid my fever cease,
To my sorrows Thou art kind.
O Thou blessed Light of Light,
Fill Thou every secret height
In Thy servant’s waiting soul!
Save for this, Thy heavenly aid,
Man would be for nothing made;
Not a sin could he control.
Cleanse Thou every sordid place
Soften harshness by Thy grace,
Heal the wounds I feel within;
Bend the stubborn will to Thine,
Cheer the thoughts that droop and pine—
Rule whatever turns to sin!
Give to them that faithful be
Everlasting trust in Thee,
All Thy sevenfold gifts bestow;
Give to virtue her reward,
Give us safety in our Lord,
Give what joy immortals know!

Holy Spirit, faithful Guide, ever near the Christian’s side;
Gently lead us by the hand, pilgrims in a desert land.
Weary souls fore’er rejoice, while they hear that sweetest voice,
Whispering softly, “Wanderer, come, follow Me, I’ll guide thee home."
Ever present, truest Friend, ever near Thine aid to lend,
Leave us not to doubt and fear, groping on in darkness drear.
When the storms are raging sore, hearts grow faint and hopes give o’er.
Whispering softly, “Wanderer, come, follow Me, I’ll guide thee home."
When our days of toil cease, waiting still for sweet release,
Nothing left but heaven and prayer, wondering if our names are there;
Wading deep the dismal flood, pleading naught but Jesus’ blood,
Whispering softly, “Wanderer, come, follow Me, I’ll guide thee home."

Holy Spirit, from on high,
Bend o’er us with pitying eye;
Now refresh the drooping heart;
Bid the power of sin depart.
Light up every dark recess
Of our heart’s ungodliness;
Show us every devious way
Where our steps have gone astray.
Teach us, with repentant grief,
Humbly to implore relief;
Then the Savior’s blood reveal,
And our broken spirits heal.
May we daily grow in grace,
And with patience run the race,
Trained in wisdom, led by love,
Till we reach our home above.

Holy Spirit, fill us now,
While beneath the cross we bow;
Fill us full of peace and love,
Holy Spirit from above.
Holy Spirit, full of grace,
Show us now the Father’s face,
Brightly shining from on high,
Through a bright and beauteous sky.
Holy Spirit, full of love,
Coming like a gentle dove,
Come, baptize our hearts anew,
Sweetly, gently, like the dew.
Holy Spirit, keep us still,
Help us do the Father’s will;
Give us grace and strength each day,
Keep us in the living way.

Holy Spirit, hear us
On this sacred day;
Come to us with blessing,
Come with us to stay.
Come as once Thou camest
To the faithful few
Patiently awaiting
Jesus’ promise true.
Up to Heav’n ascending,
Our dear Lord has gone;
Yet His little children
Leaves He not alone.
To His blessed promise
Now in faith we cling.
Comforter, most holy,
Spread o’er us Thy wing.
Lighten Thou our darkness,
Be Thyself our Light;
Strengthen Thou our weakness,
Spirit of all might.
Spirit of Adoption,
Make us overflow
With Thy sevenfold blessing
And in grace to grow.
Into Christ baptized
Grant that we may be
Day and night, dear Spirit,
Perfected by Thee.

Holy Spirit! hear us; help us while we sing;
Breathe into the music of the praise we bring.
Holy Spirit! prompt us when we kneel to pray;
Nearer come and teach us what we ought to say.
Holy Spirit! shine Thou on the Book we read;
Gild its holy pages with the light we need.
Holy Spirit! give us each a lowly mind;
Make us more like Jesus, gentle, pure and kind.
Holy Spirit! brighten little deeds of toil;
And our playful pastimes let no folly spoil.
Holy Spirit! keep us safe from sins which lie
Hidden by some pleasure from our youthful eye.
Holy Spirit! help us daily by Thy might,
What is wrong to conquer and to choose the right.
Holy Spirit! hear us, help us while we sing;
Breathe into the music of the praise we bring.

Holy Spirit, source of gladness,
Come with all Thy radiance bright;
O’er our weariness and sadness
Breathe Thy life and shed Thy light!
Send us Thine illumination,
Banish all our fears at length;
Rest upon this congregation,
Spirit of unfailing strength.
Let that love which knows no measure,
Now in quickening showers descend,
Bringing us the richest treasures
Man can wish or God can send;
Hear our earnest supplication,
Every struggling heart release;
Rest upon this congregation,
Spirit of untroubled peace!

Holy Spirit, Truth divine,
Dawn upon this soul of mine;
Word of God and inward light
Wake my spirit, clear my sight.
Holy Spirit, Love divine,
Glow within this heart of mine;
Kindle every high desire;
Perish self in Thy pure fire.
Holy Spirit, Power divine
Fill and nerve this will of mine;
Grant that I may strongly live,
Bravely bear, and nobly strive.
Holy Spirit, Right divine,
King within my conscience reign;
Be my Lord, and I shall be
Firmly bound, forever free.
Holy Spirit, Peace divine,
Still this restless heart of mine;
Speak to calm this tossing sea,
Stayed in Thy tranquility.
Holy Spirit, Joy divine,
Gladden Thou this heart of mine;
In the desert ways I sing,
“Spring, O Well, forever spring."
Now incline me to repent,
Let me now my sins lament,
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

Holy Trinity of Love,
perfect peace that has no end;
you are our eternal hope:
maker, guide and human friend.
Through earth's devastating storms,
thunderclouds that hide your face,
still, Creator God, you hold
chaos in the grip of grace.
Through earth's troubles and alarms,
more than ocean's countless waves,
Christ, command our fears, "Be still;"
give the peace our spirit craves.
Holy Spirit, when life's storms
overwhelm us, and we drown;
lifted by your peace and power,
we still tread the chaos down.
Holy, holy, holy God,
pain and death, the throes of hell,
cannot conquer! Even now,
we believe, all shall be well.

Holy, and true, and righteous Lord,
I wait to prove Thy perfect will,
Be mindful of Thy gracious Word,
And stamp me with Thy Spirit’s seal.
Open my faith’s interior eye,
Display Thy glory from above;
And all I am shall sink and die,
Lost in astonishment and love.
Confound, o’erpower me by Thy grace,
I would be by myself abhorred;
All might, all majesty, all praise,
All glory, be to Christ my Lord.
Now let me gain perfection’s height,
Now let me into nothing fall;
Be less than nothing in Thy sight,
And feel that Christ is all in all!

Holy fire from heaven, descend on us we pray, let us burn again
Holy fire from heaven, consume our hearts today, let us burn again
Let us burn again
Holy breath from heaven, descend on us we pray, let us breathe again
Holy breath from heaven, revive our hearts today, let us breathe again
Waiting in expectancy
Surrendered to your sovereignty
We're hungry for true intimacy, Lord
For the things of your heart
Holy stream from heaven, descend to us we pray, let us drink again
Holy stream from heaven, bring new life today, let us drink again
Let us drink again

Many waters cannot quench your love, rivers cannot overwhelm it
Oceans of fear cannot conceal your love for me
(Repeat)
Your love for me
Holy love, flow in me, fill me up like the deepest sea
Like a crashing wave pouring over me
Holy love flow in me
Many sorrows cannot quench your love, darkness cannot overwhelm it
I will not fear, your love is here to comfort me

When I find you I find peace
And I know that there's no river so wide
No mountain so high, no ocean so deep

Album: Live from the Strip 

Holy Spirit, lead us now
Boldly to the throne of grace;
While our heads in prayer we bow,
Let Thy presence fill this place;
Holy Spirit, Heav'nly Guide,
Lead us to the Crucified!
This is now our time of need,
This is now the day of grace;
Now our souls with manna feed,
Ere we leave this sacred place:
Holy Spirit, Heav'nly Dove,
Lead us to the feast of love!
At the blessed mercy seat,
Peace and joy are freely giv'n;
While we wait at Jesus' feet,
Make this place the gate of heav'n;
Holy Spirit, Heav'nly Friend,
Now upon our hearts descend!
Weak and sinful though we be,
Jesus' blood can cleanse from sin;
At the Fountain full and free,
Wash and make us pure within:
Holy Spirit, Cleansing Fire,
Burn up ev'ry base desire 

Oh, home of my soul
In that far away goal,
Each day brings me nearer to thee;
The great throne so white,
And my crown shining bright,
Mine eyes ever longing to see.
A musical strain
From that far distant plain
Now sweeps gently over my soul;
And waves of sweet peace
In my heart shall increase,
While years of eternity roll.
The day will soon come
When we’ll all gather home,
As pilgrims no more we shall roam;
Ah, whom shall we see?
And what joy will it be
To meet with the dear ones at home!

Cheer, O cheer, ye sons of Zion!
Weary days will soon be past;
Joy’s bright banner waving o’er us
Tells that Heav’n is won at last.
On that fair, celestial morning,
Comes no cloud of grief or pain;
In your peaceful tents abiding,
Sorrow ne’er shall come again.
Cheer, O cheer, ye sons of Zion!
Weary days will soon be past;
Joy’s bright banner waving o’er us
Tells that Heav’n is won at last.
Cheer, O cheer, the morn is breaking!
Gloomy night will disappear;
Christ will come with sweet awaking;
Happier days will soon be here;
Long the pilgrim path we’ve wandered,
Long we’ve hoped ’mid doubt and fear,
Hard we’ve pressed thro’ many a battle—
Now the day of peace is here.
Cheer, O cheer, the morn is breaking!
Bright its beams of promise rise;
Sing, O sing, ye heirs of Zion!
Hear the welcome from the skies:
“Come, ye blessed of My Father,"
Faint no more ’mid doubts and fears;
Heaven’s bright portal opes before you;
Wait for you immortal years.

You live on the highest mountains
You swim in the deepest sea
You dwell in the grandest canyon (canyon, canyon)
Yet You make Your home inside of me
Yes You make Your home inside of me
You call to the leaves in springtime
And you speak to the kings of men
You breathe life, life into a baby
Yet You make Your home inside of me
Yes You make Your home inside of me
Home inside of me
Home inside of me
Of all the places You could be
You choose to make Your home (home inside of me)
Inside of me
You walk through the starry heavens
You run to the soul that seeks
You climb the hill of sorrow
Yet You make Your home inside of me
Yes You make Your home inside of me
Home inside of me (inside of me)
Home inside of me
Of all the places You could be (places you could be)
You choose to make Your home (home inside of me)
Inside of me

I will sing you a song of that beautiful land,
The far away home of the soul,
Where no storms ever beat on the glittering strand,
While the years of eternity roll,
While the years of eternity roll;
Where no storms ever beat on the glittering strand,
While the years of eternity roll.
Oh, that home of the soul! In my visions and dreams
Its bright, jasper walls I can see;
Till I fancy but thinly the veil intervenes
Between the fair city and me,
Between the fair city and me;
Till I fancy but thinly the veil intervenes
Between the fair city and me.
That unchangeable home is for you and for me,
Where Jesus of Nazareth stands;
The King of all kingdoms forever is He,
And He holdeth our crowns in His hands,
And He holdeth our crowns in His hands;
The King of all kingdoms forever is He,
And He holdeth our crowns in His hands.
Oh, how sweet it will be in that beautiful land,
So free from all sorrow and pain,
With songs on our lips and our harps in our hands,
To meet one another again,
To meet one another again;
With songs on our lips and our harps in our hands,
To meet one another again.

Spoken Vocal:
"I hope you're ready for a great afternoon of baseball here at Clifty Stadium 
because these guys are hungry for a victory today.Looking for that sweet 
deliverance.Are you ready? Play ball!" 
The lights go on, another game day
I grabbed my bat and headed for the plate
But the first pitch was a curve, and I was done
"STRIKE ONE!"
I stepped out of the box, looked the pitcher in the eye
You could read his lips, he said, "Punk you're mine!"
So I gave him a wink and said, "Let's see what you can do"
"STRIKE TWO!" 
Got to keep my eye on the ball
Swing straight and true and follow through
Don't be afraid whatever the call
Because we're never alone, our coach is there to cheer us on
Well it's the wind up (batter up, batter up), here comes the ball (batter up, 
batter up)
You got to pray and swing, watch it till it's going, going, it's gone
Oh, oh, oh home run
Oh, oh, oh home run 
You know life can be like a baseball game
We're on the same team but we're not all the same
That's why we've got to learn to play together
I didn't join this team to sit on the bench
I'm going deep swinging for the fence
I've got some friends on base I've got to get home 
We are not the first to play this game or stand over this plate
We are surrounded by the legacy like they're sitting in the stands
I can see them waving their hands
Go, go all the way 
Spoken Vocal:
"It's going, it's going, it's going, home run.It is outta here.That baby's 
gone." 
Oh, oh, oh home run (we need a home run)
Oh, oh, oh home run (we need a home run)
Oh, oh, oh home run (get back, get back, oh it's gone - forget about that one)
Oh, oh, oh home run (aloha means goodbye)
Oh, oh, oh home run (I don't know what that pitch was, but it tastes like 
chicken) 

Goin' home, where I belong 
They say that Heaven's pretty
Living here is too
But if they said that I would have to choose between the two
I'd go home, goin' home (going home)
Where I belong (I belong) 
Sometimes when I'm dreamin' (sometimes dreamin')
It comes as no surprise (no surprise)
But if you look you'll see the homesick feelin' in my eyes
I'm goin' home (goin' home), yes I am goin' home (goin' home)
Where I belong (I be., I belong) 
While I'm here I'll serve Him gladly
And sing him all these songs
I'm here, but not for long (not for long) 
When I'm feelin' lonely (feeling lonely)
And when I'm feelin' blue (feeling blue)
It's such a joy to know that I'm only passin' through
I'm headed home (goin' home), goin' home (goin' home)
Where I belong (I belong) 
One day I'll be sleepin' (I'll be sleepin')
When death knocks on my door (on my door)
And I'll awake to find that I'm not homesick anymore
Cause I'll be home (goin' home), I'll be home (goin' home)
Where I belong (home where I belong) 
This is where I belong

Don't cry for me when you see that I'm missing
I'm finally on my way home
My blessed Lord will be waiting to greet me
From his arms I'll never roam
Yes I will rise and join all the saints gone on before
I'll sing up there and praise Him for aye
The greatest joy with be Jesus to love and adore
Yes it will be a great homecoming day
I'll take my flight to that gloryland city
I'll sing and shout evermore
Homecoming day will be worth all the waiting
I am ready now to soar
The greatest joy with be Jesus to love and adore
Yes it will be a great homecoming day

When you hear of my home going.Don't worry about me.
When you hear of my home going.Don't worry about me.

Out on an ocean all boundless we ride,
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound;
Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide,
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound;
Far from the safe, quiet harbor we rode,
Seeking our Father’s celestial abode;
Promise of which on us each He bestowed:
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound.
Wildly the storm sweeps us on as it roars,
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound;
Look! yonder lie the bright heavenly shores:
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound;
Steady, O pilot! stand firm at the wheel;
Steady! we soon shall outweather the gale;
Oh, how we fly ’neath the loud creaking sail!
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound.
Into the harbor of Heav’n now we glide;
We’re home at last, home at last;
Softly we drift on its bright silver tide;
We’re home at last, home at last;
Glory to God! all our dangers are o’er;
We stand secure on the glorified shore;
Glory to God! we will shout evermore:
We’re home at last, home at last;

Honor and glory, thanksgiving and praise,
Maker of all things, to Thee we upraise;
God the Almighty, the Father, the Lord;
God by the angels obeyed and adored.
Thou art the Father of heaven and earth;
Worlds uncreated to Thee owe their birth;
All the creation, Thy voice when it heard,
Started to life and to light at Thy Word.
Ocean the restless, and waters that swell,
Lightnings that flash over flood, over fell,
Own Thee the Master Almighty, and call
Thee the Creator, the Father, of all.
Yea, Thou art Father of all, and Thy love
Pity for man that is fallen doth move;
Guide us in life, and protect to the last;
And, at Thine Advent, Lord, pardon the past.

O my brother, do you know the Savior,
Who is wondrous kind and true?
He’s the “Rock of your salvation!"
There’s Honey in the Rock for you.
Oh, there’s Honey in the Rock, my brother,
There’s Honey in the Rock for you;
Leave your sins for the blood to cover,
There’s Honey in the Rock for you.
Have you “tasted that the Lord is gracious,"
Do you walk in the way that’s new?
Have you drunk from the living Fountain?
There’s Honey in the Rock for you.
Do you pray unto God the Father,
“What wilt Thou have me to do?"
Never fear, He will surely answer,
There’s Honey in the Rock for you.
Then go out through the streets and byways,
Preach the Word to the many or few;
Say to every fallen brother,
There’s Honey in the Rock for you.

Have we any hope within us of a life beyond the grave,
In the sweet and vernal lands?
Do we know if this, our tabernacle, were to be dissolved,
We’ve a house not made with hands? 
We have a hope within our souls,
Brighter than the perfect day:
God has given us His Spirit,
And we want the world to hear it,
All the doubts are passed away.
Blessed hope we have within us is an anchor to the soul,
It is both steadfast and sure;
It is founded on the promises of Father’s written word,
And ’twill evermore endure.
Hope has brought us through the dangers and temptations of the past,
And we fear not those to come;
By her blessings we’ll go forward, while our mortal life shall last,
Then we’ll joyously go home.
Since we’ve walked the strait and narrow way our path has ever shone
Brighter, brighter, day by day;
Hope within our hearts assures us it is better farther on,
It is brighter all the way.
Life will end in joyful singing, “I have fought a faithful fight,"
Then we’ll lay our armor down;
And our soul will break the cable here, and take its happy flight,
To possess a starry crown.

We read of a place that’s called heaven,
It’s made for the pure and the free;
These truths in God’s Word He hath given,
How beautiful heaven must be.
How beautiful heaven must be,
Sweet home of the happy and free;
Fair heaven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.
In heaven no drooping nor pining,
No wishing for elsewhere to be;
God’s light is forever there shining,
How beautiful heaven must be.
Pure waters of life there are flowing,
And all who will drink may be free;
Rare jewels of splendor are glowing,
How beautiful heaven must be.
The angels so sweetly are singing,
Up there by the beautiful sea;
Sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing,
How beautiful heaven must be.

Beyond this world of toil and care,
Beyond this veil of gloom;
There is a land, a happy land,
A place we call our home.
Oh, yes, we'll trust Him while we live!
We'll trust Him when we die;
And then when all our work is done,
We'll reign with Him on high.
Oh, what a blessed hope is this,
An anchor to the soul;
And if we do our Savior's will,
We'll safely reach the goal.
God says, 添e must be born again";
To us this truth is giv'n;
And if we do not His commands,
We shall not enter heav'n.
To enter heav'n we must be pure
And holy in His sight;
And every day we surely must
Be walking in the light.
We'll pray for God to keep our feet
Upon the Corner Stone;
We'll give our hearts and lives to Him,
For we are not our own.

How sweet is the comfort and rest of my soul,
Where peace doth so tranquilly flow;
Though storm-cloud and tempest and dark billows roll,
All my heart with His sunlight doth glow.
How sweet is my rest! And how richly I’m blest!
Oh, how sweet is the rest of my soul! 
No fears shall alarm me though Satan be nigh,
He’s subject to Jesus’ control;
Though tempted and tried, Christ regardeth my cry,
Truly He is the joy of my soul.
My sins all are gone, oh, what rapture to know
They’re nailed to the cross where He died;
The blood doth atone and my heart doth o’erflow,
Praise the Lord for the soul-cleansing tide! 
I’m saved even now, and though death soon may come,
No harm shall it bring to my soul;
For all it can do is to carry me home,
To be safe while the ages shall roll.

How sweet is my walk with Jesus!
What blessings He breathes on me!
We walk in the golden morning—
And, oh, how my soul is free!—
And onward together journey,
As swiftly the moments fly;
I sing of His love at evening,
As twilight illumes the sky.
Oh, sweet is my walk with Jesus!
How gently He smiles on me!
Yet, nearer, my Lord so precious,
Oh, help me to walk with Thee.
How sweet is my walk with Jesus!
His whispers of peace I hear;
His banner of love is o’er us,
And angels are hov’ring near;
I walk in the light with Jesus,
He shines in the narrow way;
The shadows of sin are vanished,
I walk in the light of day.
How sweet is my walk with Jesus!
I love all the way He trod;
Embraced in His sweet communion,
I’ll walk with the Son of God;
I turn from the paths of pleasure,
And closer to Jesus press;
I’ll walk with my dear Redeemer,
In His perfect holiness.

Jesus, hope of the nations
Jesus, comfort for all who mourn
You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
Jesus, light in the darkness
Jesus, truth in each circumstance
You are the source of heaven's light on earth
In history, You lived and died,
You broke the chains, You rose to life
You are the hope, living in us
You are the Rock, in whom we trust
You are the light, shining for all the world to see
You rose from the dead, conquering fear
Our Prince of Peace, drawing us near
Jesus our hope, living for all who will receive
Lord we believe! (Lord we believe Lord we believe)

Hosanna, hosanna,
blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord

Hosanna in the highest
To our exalted Savior,
Who left behind for all mankind
These tokens of His favor:
His bleeding love and mercy,
His all redeeming Passion;
Who here displays, and gives the grace
Which brings us our salvation.
Louder than gathered waters,
Or bursting peals of thunder,
We lift our voice and speak our joys
And shout our loving wonder.
Shout, all our elder brethren,
While we record the story
Of Him that came and suffered shame,
To carry us to glory.
Angels in fixed amazement
Around our altars hover,
With eager gaze adore the grace
Of our eternal Lover:
Himself and all His fullness
Who gives to the believer;
And by this bread whoe’er are fed
Shall live with God for ever.

Hosanna! Jesus reigns!
All pow'r is in his hand; The trumpet of his gospel sounds
Salvation through our land.
The King of kings he is--
His honors spread abroad
The Lord of lords; and he should be
By heav'n and earth adored.
Let old and young combine
To sing his lofty praise;
The heav'nly hosts and saints on earth
Their sweetest anthems raise.

Hosanna to the living Lord!
Hosanna to the th’Incarnate Word!
To Christ, Creator, Savior, King,
Let earth, let heaven, Hosanna ring!
Hosanna, Lord!
Hosanna in the highest!
“Hosanna, Lord!" Thine angels cry;
“Hosanna, Lord!" Thy saints reply;
Above, beneath us, and around,
The dead and living swell the sound:
O Savior, with protecting care,
Return to this Thy house of prayer;
Assembled in Thy sacred Name,
Now we Thy parting promise claim:
But chiefest, in our cleansed breast,
Eternal, bid Thy Spirit rest,
And make our secret soul to be
A temple pure, and worthy Thee.
So in the last and dreadful day,
When earth and heaven shall melt away,
Thy flock, redeemed from sinful stain,
Shall swell the sound of praise again.
Hosanna, Lord! Hosanna in the highest!

Hosanna to the Prince of Light 
That clothes himself in clay,
Entered the iron gates of death,
And tore the bars away.
Death is no more the king of dread,
Since our Immanuel rose;
He took the tyrant's sting away,
And spoiled our hellish foes.
See how the Conqueror mounts aloft,
And to His Father flies.
With scars of honor in His flesh,
And triumph in His eyes.
Raise your devotion, mortal tongues,
To reach His blest abode;
Sweet be the accents of your songs
To our incarnate God.
Bright angels, strike your loudest strings
Your sweetest voices raise;
Let heav'n and all created things
Sound our Immanuel's praise.

Hosanna we sing, like the children dear,
In the olden days when the Lord lived here;
He blessed little children, and smiled on them,
While they chanted His praise in Jerusalem.
Alleluia we sing, like the children bright,
With their harps of gold and their raiment white,
As they follow their Shepherd with loving eyes,
Through the beautiful valleys of Paradise.
Hosanna we sing, for He bends His ear,
And rejoices the hymns of His own to hear;
We know that His heart will never wax cold
To the lambs that He feeds in His earthly fold.
Alleluia we sing in the Church we love,
Alleluia resounds in the Church above,
To Thy little ones, Lord, may such grace be given,
That we lose not our part in the song of Heav’n.

Hosanna, loud hosanna, the little children sang;
Through pillared court and temple the lovely anthem rang.
To Jesus, Who had blessed them close folded to His breast,
The children sang their praises, the simplest and the best.
From Olivet they followed mid an exultant crowd,
The victor palm branch waving, and chanting clear and loud.
The Lord of men and angels rode on in lowly state,
Nor scorned that little children should on His bidding wait.
“Hosanna in the highest!" that ancient song we sing,
For Christ is our Redeemer, the Lord of heaven our King.
O may we ever praise Him with heart and life and voice,
And in His blissful presence eternally rejoice!

Hour by hour we trust in Jesus,
Hour by hour for strength we pray;
Hour by hour the sands are dropping
From the glass of time away.
We are going home where the pure and blest
In perfect peace with Jesus free from care shall rest;
Then let us go on with a happy, happy song,
Then let us go on with a happy, happy song;
O soon we’ll rest on yonder shore,
Rest forevermore.
Hour by hour we hear a warning
From the spirit-voice within;
Hour by hour we meet the tempter,
Hour by hour we fall or win.
Hour by hour we journey onward,
Hour by hour we stem the tide;
Hour by hour we miss the dear ones,
Anchored on the other side.
Hour by hour the heart grows fainter,
Hour by hour the sunlight dies;
Hour by hour we near the portals
Of our home beyond the skies.

House of Praise, House of Praise
There is a path before us
And it's there that we must choose
For the road that leads to life is what we're after
Within the pounding 
We hear the words of truth
For the knowledge of Him brings the joy and laughter
Dwelling in the presence of His majesty
Is liberty, I'm free to sing
That is where my soul will always long to be
Even when it seems I can't go on
The Lord, He has given me the power
(And He's) with me every hour
And made my heart His dwelling place
And Lord, we thank You for Your Son
And all the battles won
That brought me to Your house of praise
House of Praise
He will always answer you
When you kneel to pray
God has made it plain that He is the giver
It may not be in my time
But I know He'll make a way
Cause I'm living in the light of One who delivers
(Oh, yes I'm) Reaching down from heaven
He took hold of me
So carefully He rescued me (oh, He rescued me)
No one here has yet encountered Calvary
(Oh, and) That is why in faith I'm pressin' on
We magnify Your name most high
We look to You for your are life
We endlessly adore Your name
For You will always be the same
You are the Lord of lords
And King of kings
We praise Your name in everything
We long to see You in the sky
We love You, lift You on high
Bringing me to your house of Praise (

Why do you call me Lord? (Lord)
Don't do what I say (say)
Listen to the wise man (wise)
And heed his ways (ways)
And if you stop for a moment I'll show you (stop for a moment I'll show you)
How wonderful life can be (wondeful)
If like the wise man you faithfully follow (wise man you faithfully follow)
All the words that you've heard from Me (I will follow)
And when the storms came down the footings he'd laid
Prevented the ruin of the house he'd made 
And the storm (it couldn't shake it)
And the winds (they couldn't break it)
And the streams (they) couldn't take it away
And the rock (is standin' tall)
And the house (will never fall)
And the storm will never take it away
No, the storm will never take it away 
Why do you call me Lord?
And don't do what I say
Castles in the sand will simply float away
(Many have heard) Many have heard My words now
(Many close their eyes) And many have closed their eyes
(No foundation) With no true foundation
(Comes as no surprise) It comes as no surprise
And when the storm came down and collapsed those walls
It ruined the house with a mighty great fall 
(Never take it away) 
The wise man built his house on solid ground (on the rock)
And his house stood strong when the storm came down (down) 
No, the storm will never take it away 
Why do you call me Lord?

Hover o’er me, Holy Spirit,
Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.
Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come, and fill me now.
Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee,
Come, O come and fill me now.
I am weakness, full of weakness,
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
Fill with power and fill me now.
Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me,
Bathe, O bathe my heart and brow;
Thou art comforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now.

How about your heart, is it right with God?
That's the thing that counts today
Is it black by sin, is it pure within?
Could you ask Christ in to stay?
People often see you as you are outside
Jesus really knows you for He sees inside
How about your heart, is it right with God?
That's the thing that counts today
People often see you as you are outside
Jesus really knows you for He sees inside
How about your heart, is it right with God?
That's the thing that counts today

How are Thy servants blest, O Lord!
How sure is their defense!
Eternal wisdom is their guide,
Their help Omnipotence.
In foreign realms, and lands remote,
Supported by Thy care,
Through burning climes they pass unhurt,
And breathe in tainted air.
When by the dreadful tempest borne
High on the broken wave,
They know Thou art not slow to her,
Nor impotent to save.
The storm is laid, the winds retire,
Obedient to Thy will,
The sea, that roars at Thy command,
At Thy command is still.
From all our griefs and fears, O Lord,
Thy mercy sets us free;
While in the confidence of prayer
Our hearts take hold on Thee.
In midst of dangers, fears and death,
Thy goodness we adore;
We praise Thee for Thy mercies past,
And humbly hope for more
Our life, while Thou preservest life,
A sacrifice shall be;
And death, when death shall be our lot,
Shall join our souls to Thee.

How beauteous are their feet
Who stand on Zion’s hill!
Who bring salvation on their tongues,
And words of peace reveal!
How charming is their voice!
How sweet the tidings are!
“Zion, behold thy Savior King;
He reigns and triumphs here."
How happy are our ears
That hear this joyful sound,
Which kings and prophets waited for,
And sought, but never found!
How blessed are our eyes
That see this heav’nly light
Prophets and kings desired it long,
But died without the sight.
The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ;
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
And deserts learn the joy.
The Lord makes bare His arm
Through all the earth abroad;
Let every nation now behold
Their Savior and their God.

How beautiful the mystery:
Th’eternal Word comes down
To live and love and die and rise,
To claim His victor’s crown.
Content we find Him cradled there
Amongst the filth and beasts.
Who would believe that He will be
Our guide from death to peace!
By angry swords and dark decree
He’s driven from His land.
But still He humbly bows His head
To trust His Father’s hand.
The spotless Lamb lays down His life,
A curse upon a cross.
Then lives that He might guarantee
That no sheep will be lost.
O! May our hearts grow ever fond
Of Mary’s precious boy:
Our Christ, our hope, our heart’s desire,
Our King and Sov’reign Joy.

How beauteous were the marks divine,
That in Thy meekness used to shine;
That lit Thy lonely pathway, trod
In wondrous love, O Lamb of God!
Oh! who like Thee, so calm, so bright;
So pure, so made to live in light?
Oh, who like Thee did ever go
So patient through a world of woe?
Oh, who like Thee so humbly bore
The scorn, the scoffs of men, before?
So meek, forgiving, godlike, high,
So glorious in humility?
And all Thy life’s unchanging years,
A man of sorrows and of tears,
The cross, where all our sins were laid,
Upon Thy bending shoulders weighed.
E’en death, which sets the prisoner free,
Was pain, and scoff, and scorn to Thee;
Yet love through all Thy torture glowed,
And mercy with Thy lifeblood flowed.
Oh, in Thy light be mine to go,
Illumining all my way of woe!
And give me ever on the road
To trace Thy footsteps, Son of God!

We read of a place that’s called heaven,
It’s made for the pure and the free;
These truths in God’s Word He hath given,
How beautiful heaven must be.
How beautiful heaven must be,
Sweet home of the happy and free;
Fair heaven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.
In heaven no drooping nor pining,
No wishing for elsewhere to be;
God’s light is forever there shining,
How beautiful heaven must be.
Pure waters of life there are flowing,
And all who will drink may be free;
Rare jewels of splendor are glowing,
How beautiful heaven must be.
The angels so sweetly are singing,
Up there by the beautiful sea;
Sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing,
How beautiful heaven must be.

How beautiful the sight
Of brethren who agree
In friendship to unite,
And bonds of charity;
’Tis like the precious ointment, shed
O’er all his robes, from Aaron’s head.
’Tis like the dews that fill
The cups of Hermon’s flowers;
Or Zion’s fruitful hill,
Bright with the drops of showers,
When mingling odors breathe around,
And glory rests on all the ground
For there the Lord commands
Blessings, a boundless store,
From His unsparing hands,
Yea, life forevermore;
Thrice happy they who meet above
To spend eternity in love!

I will rejoice in You and be glad, oh so glad
I will delight in Your presence, how beautiful You are
With such great excitement my spirit arises
To hear Your sweet voice
I belong to You beloved,
and You are mine
How beautiful You are.I just can't get enough
Day after day and moment by moment
I desire more of Your love
I will rejoice in You and be glad, oh so glad
I will delight in Your presence, how beautiful You are
With such great excitement my spirit arises
To hear Your sweet voice
I belong to You beloved,
and You are mine

How bitter-sweet the mystery:
Christ Jesus crucified.
Yet, He is not the guilty one,
No sin, though still He dies.
Hung on a cross of rugged wood,
Received He from God’s hand,
The penalty, the wage of sin,
Deserved by wicked man.
O! Even more hope we shall find
Beyond the death He died.
Consider this, that from the grave
He rose and is alive.
For to this end Christ Jesus died
Was raised and lives again;
That He might be the Lord of both
The dead and the living!
What glorious day we long await
When Christ His church shall raise.
Since then for all eternity
The Risen One we’ll praise.
God demonstrates His love in this:
While we were yet in sin,
Christ Jesus died on our behalf.
We’re saved from wrath through Him!
Now sinner, hear! To His grace turn!
Repent, and be forgiv’n—
United with Him in His death;
Alive with Him now ris’n.

Don't walk with the wicked, don't sit with the scoffer
Don't stand with the sinner, they've nothin' to offer
How blessed is the man,
how blessed is the man
Who puts his trust in
the Law of the Lord
He is like a tree planted by water
Bears fruit in it's season, it's leaf never withers ()
In all that he does the righteous will prosper
Not so for the wicked, they're headin' for disaster ()
How blessed is the man,
how blessed is the man
Who puts his trust in
the Law of the Lord
Who puts his trust in
the Law of the Lord

How blessed, from the bonds of sin
And earthly fetters free,
In singleness of heart and aim,
Thy servant, Lord, to be;
The hardest toil to undertake
With joy at Thy command,
The meanest office to receive
With meekness at Thy hand.
With willing heart and longing eyes
To watch before Thy gate,
Ready to run the weary race,
To bear the heavy weight;
No voice of thunder to expect,
But follow calm and still;
For love can easily divine
The One Beloved’s will.
Thus may I serve Thee, gracious Lord;
Thus ever Thine alone,
My soul and body given to Thee,
The purchase Thou hast won;
Through evil or through good report
Still keeping by Thy side;
And by my life or by my death
Let Christ be magnified.
How happily the working days
In this dear service fly,
How rapidly the closing hour,
The time of rest, draws nigh,
When all the faithful gather home,
A joyful company;
And ever where the Master is
Shall His blest servants be.

How blest are all the saints, our God,
who having crossed the troubled sea,
have gained the harbor of your peace
and rest in your tranquility.
Watch over us who voyage still,
with risk and danger yet to face;
remember all beset by storms
and hold them in your steadfast grace.
Our vessel's frail, the ocean wide;
but your love steers, and we aspire
to gain the peaceful shore at last,
the haven of our heart's desire.
Then we shall praise you endlessly,
great God, to whom all praise is due;
as you have made us for yourself,
our hearts must find their rest in you.

How blest are they who hear God’s Word
And keep and heed what they have heard!
They wisdom daily gather;
Their light shines brighter day by day,
And while they tread life’s weary way,
They have the oil of gladness
To soothe their pain and sadness.
God’s Word a treasure is to me,
Through sorrow’s night my sun shall be,
The shield of faith in battle.
The Father’s hand hath written there
My title as His child and heir,
“The kingdom’s thine forever."
That promise faileth never.
Today I was my Savior’s guest,
My soul was here so richly blest,
The Bread of Life receiving.
Oh, may thereby my faith prevail,
So that its fruits shall never fail
Till my account is given
Before the throne in Heaven!

How blest is he whose trespass
Hath freely been forgiv’n,
Whose sin is wholly covered
Before the sight of Heav’n.
But he to whom Jehovah
Will not impute his sin,
Who has a guileless spirit,
Whose heart is true within.
While I kept guilty silence
My strength was spent with grief;
Thy hand was heavy on me,
My soul found no relief;
But when I owned my trespass,
My sin hid not from Thee,
When I confessed transgression,
Then Thou forgavest me.
So let the godly seek Thee
In times when Thou art near;
No whelming floods shall reach them,
Nor cause their hearts to fear.
In Thee, O Lord, I hide me,
Thou savest me from ill,
And songs of Thy salvation
My heart with rapture thrill.
I graciously will teach thee
The way that thou shalt go,
And with Mine eye upon thee
My counsel make thee know.
But be ye not unruly,
Or slow to understand,
Be not perverse, but willing
To heed My wise command.
The sorrows of the wicked
In number shall abound,
But those that trust Jehovah,
His mercy shall surround.
Then in the Lord be joyful,
In song lift up your voice;
Be glad in God, ye righteous,
Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice.

How blest is life if lived for thee,
My loving Saviour and my Lord!
No pleasures that the world can give
Such perfect gladness can afford -
To know I am thy ransomed child,
Bought by thine own most precious blood;
And from thy loving hand to take
With grateful heart each gift of good;
All day to walk beneath thy smile,
Watching thine eye to guide me still;
To rest at night beneath thy care,
Guarded by thee from every ill;
To feel that though I journey on
By stony paths and rugged ways,
Thy blessed feet have gone before,
And strength is given for weary days.
Such love shall ever make me glad,
Strong in thy strength to work or rest,
Until I see thee face to face,
And in thy light am fully blest.

How blest the man who fears the Lord
And greatly loves God’s holy will;
His children share his great reward,
And blessings all their days shall fill.
Abounding wealth shall bless his home,
His righteousness shall still endure,
To him shall light arise in gloom,
For he is merciful and pure.
The man whose hand the weak befriends
In judgment shall his cause maintain;
A peace unmoved his life attends,
And long his memory shall remain.
Of evil tidings not afraid,
His trust is in the Lord alone;
His heart is steadfast, undismayed,
For he shall see his foes o’erthrown.
With kind remembrance of the poor,
For their distress his gifts provide;
His righteousness shall thus endure,
His name in honor shall abide.
To shame the wicked shall be brought,
While righteous men shall favor gain;
Unrighteous hopes shall come to naught,
Its due reward shall sin obtain.

How blest the man who thoughtfully
The poor and weak befriends;
Deliverance in the evil day
To him Jehovah sends.
The Lord will keep him, guard his life,
On earth he shall be blest;
The Lord will not surrender him
By foes to be distressed.
Upon the bed of suffering
Jehovah will sustain,
And in his sickness God will soothe
The weariness and pain.
O Lord, to Thee my cry ascends,
Let me Thy mercy see;
Heal Thou my soul, for I have sinned,
I have offended Thee.
My enemies against me speak,
And they my life have scorned;
They wish my name to pass away,
Unhonored and unmourned.
My foe, deceitful, visits me,
By seeming kindness led,
His heart intent on gathering
Some hurtful news to spread.
My foes, together whispering,
Their evil plans devise;
Disease, they say, cleaves fast to him,
Laid low, he shall not rise.
Yea, he who was my chosen friend,
In whom I put my trust,
Who ate my bread, now turns in wrath
To crush me in the dust.
Do Thou, Jehovah, show me grace,
And raise me up again,
That I with justice may requite
These base and wicked men.
By this I know assuredly
That I am loved by Thee,
Because my foe does not exult
In triumph over me.
And as for me, in uprightness
Thou dost uphold me well,
And settest me before Thy face
Forevermore to dwell.
Blest be Jehovah, Israel’s God
Forevermore.Amen.
Let age to age eternally

How blest the matron, who, endued
With holy zeal and fortitude,
Has won through grace a saintly fame,
And owns a dear and honored name.
Such holy love inflamed her breast
She would not seek on earth her rest,
But, strong in faith and patience, trod
The narrow way that leads to God.
She learned, through fasting, to control
The flesh that weigheth down the soul,
And then, by prayer’s sweet food sustained,
To seek the joys she now has gained.
O Christ, from Whom all virtue springs,
Who only doest wondrous things,
To Thee, the King of saints, we pray,
Accept and bless Thy flock today.
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
Whom with the Spirit we adore
For ever and for evermore.

How blest the perfect in the way,
Who from God’s law do not depart,
Who, holding fast the Word of truth,
Seek Him with undivided heart.
Yea, they are kept from paths of sin
Who walk in God’s appointed way;
Thy precepts Thou hast given us
That we should faithfully obey.
My wavering heart is now resolved
Thy holy statutes o fulfill;
No more shall I be brought to shame
When I regard Thy holy will.
To Thee my praise sincere shall rise
When I Thy righteous judgments learn;
Forsake me not, but be my Guide,
And from Thy truth I will not turn.

How blest the righteous when he dies!
When sinks a weary soul to rest,
How mildly beam the closing eyes,
How gently heaves th’expiring breast!
So fades a summer cloud away;
So sinks a gale when storms are o’er;
So gently shuts the eye of day;
So dies a wave along the shore.
A holy quiet reigns around,
A calm which life nor death destroys;
And naught disturbs that peace profound
Which his unfettered soul enjoys.
Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears,
Where lights and shades alternate dwell;
How bright th’unchanging morn appears!
Farewell, inconstant world, farewell!
Life’s labor done, as sinks the clay,
Light from its load the spirit flies,
While Heav’n and earth combine to say,
“How blest the righteous when he dies!"

How bright appears the morning star,
With mercy beaming from afar!
The host of Heav’n rejoices!
O righteous Branch! O Jesse’s Rod!
Thou Son of man, and Son of God!
We too will lift our voices
Jesus! Jesus! Holy, holy! yet most lowly!
Draw Thou near us:
Great Emmanuel! stoop and hear us!
Rejoice, ye heav’ns, thou earth, reply!
With praise, ye sinners, fill the sky!
For this His incarnation!
Incarnate God, put forth Thy power,
Ride on, ride on, great Conqueror,
Till all know Thy salvation.
Amen, amen! Alleluia, alleluia!
Praise be given
Evermore, by earth and Heaven.

How bright these glorious spirits shine!
Whence all their white array?
How came they to the blissful seats
Of everlasting day?
Lo! these are they from sufferings great
Who came to realms of light;
And in the blood of Christ have washed
Those robes which shine so bright.
Now with triumphal palms they stand
Before the throne on high,
And serve the God they love amidst
The glories of the sky.
His presence fills each heart with joy,
Tunes every mouth to sing:
By day, by night, the sacred courts
With glad hosannas ring.
Hunger and thirst are felt no more,
Nor suns with scorching ray;
God is their Sun, Whose cheering beams
Diffuse eternal day.
The Lamb, Which dwells amidst the throne
Shall over them still preside,
Feed them with nourishment divine,
And all their footsteps guide.
Midst pastures green He’ll lead His flock
Where living streams appear;
And God the Lord from every eye
Shall wipe off every tear.
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.

How calm and beautiful the morn
That gilds the sacred tomb,
Where Christ the Crucified was borne,
And veiled in midnight gloom!
O weep no more the Savior slain;
The Lord is risen; He lives again.
Ye mourning saints, dry every tear
For your departed Lord;
Behold the place, He is not here,
The tomb is all unbarred;
The gates of death were closed in vain:
The Lord is risen; He lives again.
Now cheerful to the house of prayer
Your early footsteps bend;
The Savior will Himself be there,
Your Advocate and Friend:
Once by the law your hopes were slain,
But now in Christ ye live again.
How tranquil now the rising day!
’Tis Jesus still appears,
A risen Lord to chase away
Your unbelieving fears:
O weep no more your comforts slain;
The Lord is risen; He lives again.
And when the shades of evening fall,
When life’s last hour draws nigh,
If Jesus shine upon the soul,
How blissful then to die!
Since He has risen that once was slain,
Ye die in Christ to live again.

Down from His splendor in glory He came,
Into a world of woe;
Took on Himself all my guilt and my shame,
Why should He love me so?
How can I help but love Him,
When He loved me so?
How can I help but love Him,
When He loved me so?
I am unworthy to take of His grace,
Wonderful grace so free;
Yes, Jesus suffered and died in my place,
E’en for a soul like me.
He is the fairest of thousands to me,
His love is sweet and true;
Wonderful beauty in Him I now see,
More than I ever knew.

My life flows on in endless song;
Above earth’s lamentation
I hear the sweet though far off hymn
That hails a new creation:
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear the music ringing;
It finds an echo in my soul—
How can I keep from singing?
What though my joys and comforts die?
The Lord my Savior liveth;
What though the darkness gather round!
Songs in the night He giveth:
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge clinging;
Since Christ is Lord of Heav’n and earth,
How can I keep from singing?
I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;
I see the blue above it;
And day by day this pathway smoothes
Since first I learned to love it:
The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,
A fountain ever springing:
All things are mine since I am His—
How can I keep from singing?

How can I look on Calv’ry’s cross
And see my Savior there,
With outstretched arms the world to save,
My sins Himself to bear?
How contemplate and yet withstand
Such love as He has shown
Who died to draw the sinner near
And claim him for His own?
O love of God, that bro’t me there,
O love so deep, so true,
Come fill my longing heart with light
And rapture, thro’ and thro’.
How can I think of all He bore—
The shame, the thorns, the pain,
And unrepentant go my way
To pierce His heart again?
Forsaken in His darkest hour
By all, except His God,
Shall I deny my blessed Lord,
Who died to lift the rod?
No, no! I cannot traitor be
To Jesus, King of Love,
Tho’ sinner steeped in guilt I am,
His mercy I will prove;
His blood on Calv’ry’s cross was shed,
To save e’en such as me;
O Jesus, now accept my all,
And draw me close to Thee.

How Can I Sink With Such a Prop, 
As my eternal God,
Who bears the earth's huge pillars up,
And spreads the heav'ns abroad?
How can I die while Jesus lives,
Who rose and left the dead
Pardon and grace my soul receives,
From my exalted Head.
All that I am, and all I have,
Shall be forever thine;
Whate'er my duty bids me give,
My cheerful hands resign.
Yet if I might make some reserve,
And duty did not call,
I love my God with zeal so great,
That I should give him all.

How can I thank Thee, Lord,
For all Thy loving-kindness,
That Thou hast patiently
Borne with me in my blindness?
When dead in many sins
And trespasses I lay,
I kindled, holy God,
Thine anger every day.
It is Thy work alone
That I am now converted;
O'er Satan's work in me
Thou hast Thy power asserted.
Thy mercy and Thy grace
That rise afresh each morn
Have turned my stony heart
Into a heart new-born.
I could but grieve Thee, Lord,
And with my sins displease Thee;
Yet to atone for sin
My works could not appease Thee.
Though I could fall from grace
And choose the way of sin,
I had no strength to rise,
A new life to begin.
But Thou hast raised me up
To joy and exultation
And clearly shown the way
That leads me to salvation.
My sins are washed away,
For this I thank thee, Lord;
And with my heart and soul
All dead works are abhorred.
Grant that Thy Spirit's help
To me be always given
Lest I should fall again
And lose the way to heaven;
That He may give me strength
In mine infirmity
And e'er renew my heart
To serve Thee willingly.
Oh, guide and lead me, Lord,
While here below I wander
That I may follow Thee
Till I shall see Thee yonder.
For if I led myself,
I soon would go astray;
But if Thou leadest me,
I keep the narrow way.
O Father, God of Love,
Hear Thou my supplication;
O Savior, Son of God,
Grant me Thy full salvation;
And Thou, O Holy Ghost,
Be Thou my faithful Guide
That I may serve Thee here
And there with Thee abide.

How can I truly show that I love you? 
How can I truly say how I need you? 
How can I really share what I'm feeling? 
Can I reveal my heart as I'm kneeling? 
How can I ever learn your compassion? 
Covered and clothed with Christ for my fashion 
Turning aside I feel godly sorrow 
You confidently secure my tomorrow 
How can I truly show that I love you? 
How can I truly say how I need you? 
How can I really share what I'm feeling? 
How can I truly say?

How can I, Lord, keep my way pure?
To Your Word I must be true.
So I seek You with my whole heart;
Do not let me stray from You.
Your Word’s hidden in my heart, Lord,
That I might not go astray.
Praise to You, O Lord, my Father;
Teach me Your decrees each day.
With my lips I recount gladly
All the laws You’ve giv’n to man.
I rejoice in all Your statutes,
As in wealth too vast to scan.
Meditating on Your precepts,
I consider all Your ways.
I delight in Your decrees, Lord;
I will never turn away.

How can we sinners know
Our sins on earth forgiven?
How can my gracious Savior show
My name inscribed in heaven?
What we have felt and seen,
With confidence we tell,
And publish to the ends of earth
The signs infallible.
We who in Christ believe
That He for us hath died,
We all His unknown peace receive
And feel His blood applied.
Exults for joy our rising soul,
Disburthened of her load,
And swells, unutterably full
Of glory and of God.
His love surpasses far
The love of all beneath,
We find within, and dare
The pointless darts of death.
Stronger than death, or sin, or hell,
The mystic power we prove,
And conquerors of the world we dwell
In heaven, who dwell in love.
We by His Spirit prove
And know the things of God,
The things which freely of His love
He hath on us bestowed.
The meek and lowly heart
That in our Savior was,
To us that Spirit doth impart
And sign us with His cross.
Our nature’s turned, our mind
Transformed in all its powers,
And both the witnesses are joined,
The Spirit of God with ours.
His glory is our sole design,
We live our God to please,
And rise with filial fear divine
To perfect holiness.
The Spirit of my God
Hath certified Him mine,
And all the tokens showed,
Infallible, divine.
Hereby the pardoned sinner knows
His sins on earth forgiven,
And thus my gracious Savior shows
My name inscribed in Heaven.

Thorns on His head, spear in His side
Yet it was a heartache that made Him cry
He gave His life so you would understand
Is there any way you could say no to this Man?
If Christ Himself (standing here)
Were standing here (glory in His face)
Face full of glory and eyes full of tears (eyes, hold out His arms)
He'd hold out His arms with His nail-printed hands (nail scarred hands, how 
could you say no)
Is there any way you could say no to this Man?
How could you look in His tear-stained eyes
Knowing it's you He's thinking of?
Would you tell Him you're not ready to give Him your life?
Could you say you don't think you need His love?
Jesus is here with His arms open wide
You can see Him with your heart if you'll stop looking with your eyes
He's left it up to you, He's done all He can
Is there any way you could say no to this Man?
Thorns on His head, your life is in His hands
Is there any way you could say no to this Man?
Oh, is there any way you could say no to this Man?

How charming is the place
Where my Redeemer God
Unveils the beauties of His face,
And sheds His love abroad.
Not the fair palaces
To which the great resort,
Are once to be compared with this,
Where Jesus holds His court.
Here, on the mercy seat,
With radiant glory crowned,
Our joyful eyes behold Him sit,
And smile on all around.
To Him their prayers and cries
Each humble soul presents:
He listens to their broken sighs,
And grants them all their wants.
To them His sovereign will
He graciously imparts;
And in return accepts, with smiles,
The tribute of their hearts.
Give me, O Lord, a place
Within Thy blest abode,
Among the children of Thy grace,
The servants of my God.

1, How charmingly pleasing the fond recollection.
Of youthful emotions and innocent joy,
When blessed with parental advice and affection,
Surrounded with mercy and peace from on high.
I still view the chairs of my father and mother,
The seats of their offspring, as ranged on each hand,
And the richest of books, which excels every other
The family Bible that lay on the stand:
The old-fashioned Bible, the dear blessed Bible,
The family Bible that lay on the stand.
The Bible, that volume of God's inspiration,
At morning and ev'ning would yield delight;
The prayers of our father, a sweet invocation,
For mercy by day, and for safety by night.
O, hymns of thanksgiving, with harmon'ous sweetness,
As warmed by the hearts of the family band,
Hath raised us from earth to that rapturous dwelling,
Described in the Bible that lay on the stand.
3, Ye scenes of enjoyment, long have we been parted,
My hopes almost gone, and my parents no more;
In sorrow and sadness I live broken-hearted,
And wander alone on a far-distant shore.
O, why should I doubt a dear Savior's protection,
Forgetful of gifts from his bountiful hand?
O, let me with patience receive His correction,
And think of the Bible that lay on the stand.
Though age and misfortune press hard on my feelings
I'll flee to the Bible and trust in the Lord;
Though darkness should cover his merciful dealings,
My soul is still cheered by His heavenly word.
And now from things earthly my soul is removing,
I shall soon be in glory with heav'n's bright band,
And in rapture of joy be forever adoring
The God of the Bible that lay on the stand.

How cheering is the Christian’s hope,
While toiling here below!
It buoys us up while passing through
This wilderness of woe.
It buoys us up while passing through
This wilderness of woe.
It points us to a land of rest,
Where saints with Christ will reign;
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
And never part again.
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
And never part again.
Fly, lingering moments, fly, O fly;
Dear Savior, quickly come!
We long to see Thee as Thou art,
And reach that blissful shore.
We long to see Thee as Thou art,
And reach that blissful shore.

How Condescending and How Kind
Was God's exalted Son!
Our mis'ry reached His heav'nly mind,
And pity brought Him down.
When justice, by our sins provoked,
Drew forth His dreadful sword,
He gave His soul up to the stroke
Without a murm'ring word.
This was compassion like a God,
That when the Savior knew
The way of pardon was His blood,
His pity ne'er withdrew.
Now though He reigns exalted high,
His love is still as great;
Well He remembers Calvary
Nor lets His saints forget.
Here we receive repeated seals
Of Jesus' saving love;
Hard is the wretch that never feels
One soft affection move.
Here let our hearts begin to melt,
While we His death record,
And with our joy for pardoned guilt
Mourn that we pierced the Lord.

How David, when by sin deceived,
From bad to worse went on!
For when the Holy Spirit’s grieved,
Our strength and guard are gone.
His eye on Bathsheba once fixed,
With poison filled his soul;
He ventured on adultery next,
And murder crowned the whole.
So from a spark of fire at first,
That has not been descried;
A dreadful flame has often burst,
And ravaged far and wide.
When sin deceives it hardens too,
For though he vainly fought
To hide his crimes from public view,
Of God he little thought.
He neither would, or could repent,
No true compunction felt;
’Till God in mercy Nathan sent,
His stubborn heart to melt.
The parable held forth a fact,
Designed his case to show;
But though the picture was exact,
Himself he did not know.
“Thou art the man," the prophet said,
That word his slumber broke;
And when he owned his sin, and prayed,
The Lord forgiveness spoke.
Let those who think they stand, beware,
For David stood before;
Nor let the fallen soul despair,
For mercy can restore.

How dear to me, O Lord of Hosts,
The place where Thou dost dwell;
The tabernacles of Thy grace
In pleasantness excel.
My spirit longs, yea, even faints,
Thy sacred courts to see;
My thirsting heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for Thee.
Beneath Thy care the sparrow finds
A place of peaceful rest;
Where she may safely lay her young
The swallow finds a nest.
Then, Lord of Hosts, my King, my God,
Thy love will shelter me;
Beneath Thy altar’s peaceful shade
My dwelling place shall be.
Blest they who dwell within Thy house,
Their perfect strength Thou art;
Their joyful praise shall never cease,
Thy ways are in their heart.
Their tears of grief, like early rain,
Sweet springs of joy shall fill;
With strength renewed they journey safe
To Zion’s holy hill.

How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure
That he should give his only son, to make a wretch his treasure
How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turned his face away
As wounds which mar the chosen one, bring many sons to glory
Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers
It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life; I know that it is finished
I will not boast in anything: no gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ; his death and resurrection
Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart: his wounds have paid my ransom
Album: I Could Sing of Your Love Forever 2

How did my heart rejoice to hear
My friends devoutly say,
“In Zion let us all appear,
And keep the solemn day!"
I love her gates, I love the road;
The church, adorned with grace,
Stands like a palace built for God,
To show His milder face.
Up to her courts with joys unknown
The holy tribes repair;
The Son of David holds His throne,
And sits in judgment there.
He hears our praises and complaints;
And while His awful voice
Divides the sinners from the saints,
We tremble and rejoice.
Peace be within this sacred place,
And joy a constant guest!
With holy gifts and heav’nly grace
Be her attendants blest!
My soul shall pray for Zion still,
While life or breath remains;
There my best friends, my kindred dwell,
There God my Savior reigns.

How do thy mercies close me round!
For ever be thy name adored!
I blush in all things to abound;
The servant is above his Lord!
Inured to poverty and pain,
A suffering life my Master led;
The Son of God, the Son of man,
He had not where to lay his head.
But lo! a place he hath prepared
For me, whom watchful angels keep;
Yea, he himself becomes my guard,
He smooths my bed, and gives me sleep.
Jesus protects; my fears, be gone!
What can the Rock of ages move?
Safe in thy arms I lay me down,
Thy everlasting arms of love.
While thou art intimately nigh,
Who, who shall violate my rest?
Sin, earth, and hell I now defy;
I lean upon my Saviour's breast.
I rest beneath the Almighty's shade,
My griefs expire, my troubles cease;
Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed,
Wilt keep me still in perfect peace.
Me for thine own thou lov'st to take,
In time and in eternity;
Thou never, never wilt forsake
A helpless soul that trusts in thee.

How excellent is thy name
In all the earth, O Lord!
How excellent is thy name,
By all in heaven adored.
How excellent is thy name.
Let men their praises bring;
How excellent is thy name.
Of mighty kings the King!
Tho' far above all the heavens,
Their heighth and breadth and length,
From out of the mouths of babes
Thou hast ordained strength.
How excellent is thy name.
In all the earth, O Lord!
How excellent is thy name.
By all in heaven adored.
In view of thy wondrous works,
The moon and stars on high,
Oh! what is poor.feeble man
That thou should'st mind his cry?
How excellent is thy name.
Let earth thy glories sing;
How excellent is thy name.
Of mighty kings the King!

How far from home? I asked, as on
I bent my steps—the watchman spake:
“The long, dark night is almost gone,
The morning soon will break.
Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,
With Hope’s bright star thy guiding ray,
Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,
In everlasting day."
I asked the warrior on the field;
This was his soul inspiring song:
“With courage bold, the sword I’ll wield,
The battle is not long.
Then weep no more, but well endure
The conflict, till thy work is done;
For this we know, the prize is sure,
When victory is won."
I asked again; earth, sea and sun
Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:
“Time’s wasting sands are nearly run,
Eternity is nigh.
Then weep no more—with warning tones,
Portentous sights are thickening round,
The whole creation, waiting, groans,
To hear the trumpet sound."
Not far from home! O blessed thought!
The traveler’s lonely heart to cheer;
Which oft a healing balm has brought,
And dried the mourner’s tear.
Then weep no more, since we shall meet
Where weary footsteps never roam—
Our trials past, our joys complete,
Safe in our Father’s home.

How fast their guilt and sorrows rise
Who haste to seek some idol-god!
I will not taste their sacrifice,
Their offerings of forbidden blood.
My God provides a richer cup,
And nobler food to live upon:
He for my life has offered up
Jesus, His best-beloved Son.
His love is my perpetual feast;
By day His counsels guide me right;
And be His Name for ever blessed,
Who gives me sweet advice by night.
I set Him still before mine eyes;
At my right hand He stands prepared
To keep my soul from all surprise
And be my everlasting guard

How few receive with cordial faith 
The tidings which we bring? 
How few have seen the arm revealed 
Of Heav’n’s eternal King?
The Savior comes! no outward pomp 
Bespeaks His presence nigh; 
No earthly beauty shines in Him 
To draw the carnal eye.
Fair as a beauteous tender flower 
Amidst the desert grows, 
So slighted by a rebel race 
The heav’nly Savior rose.
Rejected and despised of men, 
Behold a Man of woe! 
Grief was His close companion still 
Through all His life below.
Yet all the griefs He felt were ours, 
Ours were the woes He bore: 
Pangs, not His own, His spotless soul 
With bitter anguish tore.
We held Him as condemned by Heav’n, 
An outcast from His God, 
While for our sins He groaned, He bled, 
Beneath His Father’s rod.
His sacred blood hath washed our souls 
From sin’s polluted stain; 
His stripes have healed us, and His death 
Revived our souls again.
We all, like sheep, had gone astray 
In ruin’s fatal road: 
On Him were our transgressions laid; 
He bore the mighty load.
Wronged and oppressed how meekly He 
In patient silence stood! 
Mute, as the peaceful harmless lamb, 
When brought to shed its blood.
Who can His generation tell? 
From prison see Him led! 
With impious show of law condemned, 
And numbered with the dead.
’Midst sinners low in dust He lay; 
The rich a grave supplied: 
Unspotted was His blameless life; 
Unstained by sin He died.
Yet God shall raise His head on high, 
Though thus He brought Him low; 
His sacred offering, when complete, 
Shall terminate His woe.
For, saith the Lord, My pleasure then 
Shall prosper in His hand; 
His shall a numerous offspring be, 
And still His honors stand.
His soul, rejoicing, shall behold 
The purchase of His pain; 
And all the guilty whom He saved 
Shall bless Messiah’s reign.
He with the great shall share the spoil, 
And baffle all His foes; 
Though ranked with sinners, here He fell, 
A Conqueror He rose.
He died to bear the guilt of men, 
That sin might be forgiv’n: 
He lives to bless them and defend, 
And plead their cause in Heav’n.

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
You, who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?
In every condition, in sickness, in health;
In poverty’s vale, or abounding in wealth;
At home and abroad, on the land, on the sea,
As thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be.
Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid;
I’ll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.
When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.
When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.
Even down to old age all My people shall prove
My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,
Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.
The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose,
I will not, I will not desert to its foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake.

How gentle God’s commands,
How kind His precepts are!
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord,
And trust His constant care.
Beneath His watchful eye
His saints securely dwell;
That hand which bears all nature up
Shall guide His children well.
Why should this anxious load
Press down your weary mind?
Haste to your Heavenly Father’s throne,
And sweet refreshment find.
His goodness stands approved,
Down to the present day;
I’ll drop my burden at His feet,
And bear a song away.

How glorious is the life above
Which in this ordinance we taste,
That fullness of celestial love,
That joy which shall for ever last!
That heavenly life in Christ concealed
These earthen vessels could not bear;
The part which now we find revealed
No tongue of angels can declare.
The light of life eternal darts
Into our souls a dazzling ray;
A drop of Heaven o’erflows our hearts,
And deluges the house of clay.
Sure pledge of ecstasies unknown
Shall this divine communion be:
The ray shall rise into a sun,
The drop shall swell into a sea.

How glorious Sion’s courts appear,
The city of our God!
His throne He hath established here
Here fixed His loved abode.
Its wall, defended by His grace
No power shall e’er o’erthrow,
Salvation is its bulwark sure
Against th’ assailing foe.
Lift up the everlasting gates,
The doors wide open fling;
Enter, ye nations, who obey
The statutes of our King.
Here shall ye taste unmingled joys,
And dwell in perfect peace,
Ye, who have known Jehovah’s Name,
And trusted in His grace.
Trust in the Lord, forever trust,
And banish all your fears;
Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells
Eternal as His years.
What though the wicked dwell on high,
His arm shall bring them low;
Low as the caverns of the grave
Their lofty heads shall bow.
Along the dust shall then be spread
Their towers, that brave the skies:
On them the needy’s feet shall tread,
And on their ruins rise.

How good and pleasant is the sight
When brethren make it their delight
To dwell in blest accord;
Such love is like anointing oil
That consecrates for holy toil
The servants of the Lord.
Such love in peace and joy distils,
As o’er the slopes of Hermon’s hills
Refreshing dew descends;
The Lord commands His blessing there,
And they that walk in love shall share
In life that never ends.
How good and pleasant is the sight
When brethren make it their delight
To dwell in blest accord;
The Lord commands His blessing there,
And they that walk in love shall share
In life that never ends.

How good it is to thank the Lord,
And praise to Thee, Most High, accord,
To show Thy love with morning light,
And tell Thy faithfulness each night;
Yea, good it is Thy praise to sing,
And all our sweetest music bring.
O Lord, with joy my heart expands,
Before the wonders of Thy hands;
Great works, Jehovah, Thou hast wrought,
Exceeding deep Thine every thought;
A foolish man knows not their worth,
Nor he whose mind is of the earth.
When as the grass the wicked grow,
When sinners flourish here below,
Then is there endless ruin nigh,
But Thou, O Lord, art throned on high;
Thy foes shall fall before Thy might,
The wicked shall be put to flight.
Thou, Lord, hast high exalted me
With royal strength and dignity;
With Thine anointing I am blest,
Thy grace and favor on me rest;
I thus exult o’er all my foes,
O’er all that would my cause oppose.
The righteous man shall flourish well,
And in the house of God shall dwell;
He shall be like a goodly tree,
And all his life shall fruitful be;
For righteous is the Lord and just,
He is my Rock, in Him I trust.

How good, Lord, to be here!
Your glory fills the night;
Your face and garments like the sun,
Shine with unborrowed light.
How good, Lord, to be here,
Your beauty to behold,
Where Moses and Elijah stand,
Your messengers of old.
Fulfiller of the past,
Promise of things to be:
We hail your body glorified,
And our redemption see.
Before we taste of death,
We see your kingdom come;
We have to hold the vision bright,
And make this hill our home.
How good, Lord, to be here!
Yet we will not remain;
But since you bid us leave the mount,
Come with us to the plain.

While by the sheep we watched at night,
Glad tidings brought an angel bright.
How great our joy! Great our joy!
Joy, joy, joy! Joy, joy, joy!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
There shall be born, so He did say,
In Bethlehem a Child today.
There shall the Child lie in a stall,
This Child who shall redeem us all.
This gift of God we’ll cherish well,
That ever joy our hearts shall fill.

How great the wisdom, power and grace,
Which in redemption shine!
The heavenly host with joy confess
The work is all divine.
Before His feet they cast their crowns,
Those crowns which Jesus gave,
And, with ten thousand tongues,
Proclaim His power to save.
They tell the triumphs of His cross,
The sufferings which He bore;
How low He stooped, how high He rose,
And rose to stoop no more.
With them let us our voices raise,
And still the song renew;
Salvation well deserves the praise
Of men, and angels, too.

How happy are the little flock,
Who, safe beneath their guardian Rock,
In all commotions rest!
When war’s and tumult’s waves run high,
Removed above the storm they lie,
They lodge in Jesus’ breast,
They lodge in Jesus’ breast.
Such happiness, O Lord, have we,
By mercy gathered into Thee,
Before the floods descend:
And while the bursting clouds come down,
We mark the vengeful day begun,
And calmly wait the end,
And calmly wait the end.
The plague, and dearth, and din of war,
Our Savior’s swift approach declare,
And bid our hearts arise;
Earth’s basis shook confirms our hope;
Its cities’ fall but lifts us up,
To meet Thee in the skies,
To meet Thee in the skies.
Thy tokens we with joy confess:
The war proclaims the Prince of Peace,
The earthquake speaks Thy power,
The famine all Thy fullness brings,
The plague presents Thy healing wings,
And nature’s final hour,
And nature’s final hour.
Whatever ills the world befall,
A pledge of endless good we call,
A sign of Jesus near;
His chariot will not long delay,
We hear the rumbling wheels, and pray,
Triumphant Lord, appear!
Triumphant Lord, appear!
Appear with clouds on Zion’s hill,
Thy word and mystery to fulfill,
Thy confessors to approve,
Thy members on Thy throne to place,
And stamp Thy name on every face,
In glorious, heavenly love!
In glorious, heavenly love!

How happy are Thy servants, Lord,
Who thus remember Thee!
What tongue can tell our sweet accord,
Our perfect harmony?
Who Thy mysterious supper share,
Here at Thy table fed,
Many, and yet but one we are,
One undivided bread.
One with the living bread divine
Which now by faith we eat,
Our hearts and minds and spirits join,
And all in Jesus meet.
So dear the tie where souls agree
In Jesus’ dying love!
Then only can it closer be,
When all are joined above.

How happy are they
Who the Savior obey,
And have laid up their treasure above!
Tongue can never express
The sweet comfort and peace
Of a soul in its earliest love.
That sweet comfort was mine,
When the Father divine
I first found in the blood of the Lamb;
When my heart first believed,
What a joy I received,
What heaven in Jesus’ Name!
’Twas a heaven below
My Redeemer to know,
And the angels could do nothing more,
Than to fall at His feet,
And the story repeat,
And the Lover of sinners adore.
Jesus all the day long
Was my joy and my song:
O that all His salvation might see!
“He hath loved me," I cried,
“He hath suffered and died,
To redeem a poor rebel like me."
O the rapturous height
Of that holy delight
Which I felt in the life giving blood!
By my Savior possessed,
I was perfect blest,
As if filled with the fullness of God.

Oh, how happy are we,
Who in Jesus agree,
And expect His return from above;
We sit ’neath His vine,
And delightfully join
In the praise of His excellent love.
Oh, how happy are we
Who in Jesus agree,
How happy, how happy are we.
When united to Him,
We partake of the stream
Ever flowing in peace from the throne;
We in Jesus believe,
And the Spirit receive,
That proceeds from the Father and Son.
We remember the word
Of our crucified Lord,
When He went to prepare us a place,
“I will come in that day
And will take you away,
And admit to the sight of My face."

How happy every child of grace,
Who knows his sins forgiven!
“This earth," he cries, “is not my place,
I seek my place in Heaven—
A country far from mortal sight,
Which yet by faith I see,
The land of rest, the saints’ delight,
The heaven prepared for me."
O what a blessed hope is ours!
While here on earth we stay,
We more than taste the heavenly powers,
And antedate that day.
We feel the resurrection near,
Our life in Christ concealed,
And with His glorious presence here
Our earthen vessels filled.
O would He more of heaven bestow,
And let the vessels break,
And let our ransomed spirits go
To grasp the God we seek;
In rapturous awe on Him to gaze,
Who bought the sight for me;
And shout and wonder at His grace
Through all eternity.

How happy is the pilgrim’s lot!
How free from every anxious thought,
From worldly hope and fear!
Confined to neither court nor cell,
His soul disdains on earth to dwell,
He only sojourns here.
This happiness in part is mine,
Already saved from self design,
From every creature love;
Blest with the scorn of finite good,
My soul is lightened of its load,
And seeks the things above.
The things eternal I pursue,
A happiness beyond the view
Of those that basely pant
For things by nature felt and seen;
Their honors, wealth, and pleasures mean
I neither have nor want.
I have no babes to hold me here;
But children more securely dear
For mine I humbly claim,
Better than daughters or than sons,
Temples divine of living stones,
Inscribed with Jesus’ Name.
No foot of land do I possess,
No cottage in this wilderness,
A poor wayfaring man,
I lodge awhile in tents below;
Or gladly wander to and fro,
Till I my Canaan gain.
Nothing on earth I call my own;
A stranger, to the world unknown,
I all their goods despise;
I trample on their whole delight,
And seek a country out of sight,
A country in the skies.
There is my house and portion fair,
My treasure and my heart are there.
And my abiding home;
For me my elder brethren stay,
And angels beckon me away,
And Jesus bids me come.
“I come," Thy servant, Lord, replies,
“I come to meet Thee in the skies,
And claim my heavenly rest";
Now let the pilgrim’s journey end,
Now, O my Savior, Brother, Friend.
Receive me to Thy breast!

How helpless guilty nature lies,
Unconscious of its load!
The heart, unchanged, can never rise
To happiness and God.
Can aught, beneath a power divine,
The stubborn will subdue?
’Tis Thine, almighty Spirit! Thine,
To form the heart anew.
’Tis Thine, the passions to recall,
And upward bid them rise;
To make the scales of error fall
From reason’s darkened eyes;
To chase the shades of death away,
And bid the sinner live;
A beam of Heaven, a vital ray,
’Tis Thine alone to give.
O change these wretched hearts of ours,
And give them life divine;
Then shall our passions and our powers
Almighty Lord! be Thine.

How honorable is the place
Where we adoring stand!
Zion, the glory of the earth,
And beauty of the land!
Bulwarks of mighty grace defend
The city where we dwell;
The walls, of strong salvation made,
Defy the assaults of hell.
Lift up the everlasting gates,
The doors wide open fling;
Enter, ye nations that obey
The statutes of our King.
Here shall you taste unmingled joys,
And live in perfect peace,
You that have known Jehovah’s Name.
And ventured on His grace.
Trust in the Lord, forever trust,
And banish all your fears;
Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells,
Eternal as His years.
What though the rebels dwell on high,
His arm shall bring them low;
Low as the caverns of the grave
Their lofty heads shall bow.
On Babylon our feet shall tread
In that rejoicing hour;
The ruins of her walls shall spread
A pavement for the poor.

How hurtful was the choice of Lot,
Who took up his abode
(Because it was a fruitful spot)
With them who feared not God!
A prisoner he was quickly made,
Bereaved of all his store;
And, but for Abraham’s timely aid,
He had returned no more.
Yet still he seemed resolved to stay
As if it were his rest;
Although their sins from day to day
His righteous soul distressed.
Awhile he stayed with anxious mind,
Exposed to scorn and strife;
At last he left his all behind,
And fled to save his life.
In vain his sons-in-law he warned,
They thought he told his dreams;
His daughters too, of them had learned,
And perished in the flames.
His wife escaped a little way,
But died for looking back:
Does not her case to pilgrims say,
“Beware of growing slack?"
Yea; Lot himself could ling’ring stand,
Though vengeance was in view;
’Twas mercy plucked him by the hand,
Or he had perished too.
The doom of Sodom wilt be ours
If to the earth we cleave;
Lord, quicken all our drowsy pow’rs,
To flee to Thee and live.

How I love Thy law, O Lord!
Daily joy its truths afford;
In its constant light I go,
Wise to conquer every foe.
Thy commandments in my heart,
Truest wisdom can impart;
To my eyes Thy precepts show
Wisdom more than sages know.
While my heart Thy Word obeys,
I am kept from evil ways;
From Thy law, with Thee to guide,
I have never turned aside.
Sweeter are Thy words to me
Than all other good can be;
Safe I walk, Thy truth my light,
Hating falsehood, loving right.

How joyful 'tis to sing
To God enthroned on high,
To raise the ancient strain
Of tuneful psalmody
As choristers, who thus delight
To chant his praise by day and night!
Yet art is not enough,
Nor voice that charms the ear,
Unless the heart be tuned
And worship be sincere:
Help us to fix our minds on thee,
And lead us to simplicity.
Should we with wandering thoughts
Our minds allow to stray,
Nor heed God's holy word,
And, kneeling, fail to pray,
Help us to serve with godly fear,
Lest we forget thy presence near.
We seek to perfect praise
On earth, in hope that we
Some glimpses here may gain
Of heavenly harmony,
Where discord ne'er shall mar the tone
Of those that sing around thy throne.
Then in the praise of God
Let boys and men unite,
And, mindful of our trust,
Gird on our robes of white,
As symbol of the purity
That all must seek, who seek for thee.

How long has it been, since you talked to the Lord,
And told Him your heart's hidden secrets?
How long since you prayed,
How long since you stayed,
On your knees 'til the light shone through? 
How long has it been since your mind felt at ease,
How long since your heart knew no burden?
Can you call Him your friend,
How long has it been,
Since you knew that He cared for you? 
How long has it been since you knelt by your bed,
And prayed to the Lord up in Heaven?
How long since you knew,
That He'd answer you,
And would keep you the long night through? 
How long has it been since you woke with the dawn,
And felt that the day's worth the living?
Can you call Him your friend,
How long has it been,
Since you knew that He cared for you? 
How long has it been since you talked with the Lord,
And told Him your heart's hidden secrets?
How long since you prayed,
How long since you stayed,
On your knees 'til the light shone through? 
How long has it been since you woke with the dawn,
And felt that the days' worth the living?
Can you call Him your friend?
How long has it been,
Since you knew that He cared for you?

Long have we sought eternal life,
Years have we waited in sin and strife;
In darkness groped, sad misery’s mate,
How long? how long must we wait?
How long? how long must we wait?
How long? how long must we wait?
The lab’rers still are few;
Our Lord has need of you,
How long? how long must we wait?
You know the love of God manifold,
Ages have bro’t you their grace untold;
Peace and a hope, no fear of fate.
How long? how long must we wait?
The aged faint and long for the Friend,
Dark shadows gathering bring the end;
Fades now the light, ’tis growing late.
How long? how long must we wait?

How long, O Lord, shall I complain,
Like one that seeks his God in vain?
Canst Thou Thy face for ever hide
And I still pray, and be denied?
Shall I for ever be forgot,
As one whom Thou regardest not?
Still shall my soul Thine absence mourn,
And still despair of Thy return?
How long shall my poor troubled breast
Be with these anxious thoughts oppressed?
And Satan, my malicious foe,
Rejoice to see me sunk so low?
Hear, Lord, and grant me quick relief,
Before my death conclude my grief:
If Thou withhold Thy heav’nly light,
I sleep in everlasting night.
How will the powers of darkness boast
If but one praying soul be lost!
But I have trusted in Thy grace,
And shall again behold Thy face.
Whate’er my fears or foes suggest,
Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest;
My heart shall feel Thy love, and raise
My cheerful voice to songs of praise.

How long wilt Thou conceal Thy face?
My God, how long delay?
When shall I feel those heav’nly rays
That chase my fears away?
How long shall my poor laboring soul
Wrestle and toil in vain?
Thy word can all my foes control
And ease my raging pain.
See how the prince of darkness tries
All his malicious arts;
He spreads a mist around my eyes,
And throws his fiery darts.
Be Thou my sun, and Thou my shield,
My soul in safety keep;
Make haste, before mine eyes are sealed
In death’s eternal sleep.
How would the tempter boast aloud
If I become his prey!
Behold, the sons of hell grow proud
At Thy so long delay.
But they shall fly at Thy rebuke,
And Satan hide his head;
He knows the terrors of Thy look,
And hears Thy voice with dread.
Thou wilt display Thy sovereign grace,
Where all my hopes have hung,
I shall employ my lips in praise
And victory shall be sung.

How long wilt Thou forget me,
O Lord, Thou God of grace?
How long shall fears beset me
While darkness hides Thy face?
How long shall griefs distress me
And turn my day to night?
How long shall foes oppress me
And triumph in their might?
O Lord my God, behold me
And hear mine earnest cries;
Lest sleep of death enfold me,
Enlighten Thou mine eyes;
Lest now my foe insulting
Should boast of his success,
And enemies exulting
Rejoice in my distress.
But I with expectation
Have on Thy grace relied;
My heart in Thy salvation
Shall still with joy confide;
And I with voice of singing
Will praise the Lord above,
Who, richest bounties bringing,
Has dealt with me in love.

How long wilt Thou forget me, Lord?
Shall it for ever be?
O how long shall it be that Thou
Wilt hide Thy face from me?
How long take counsel in my soul,
Still sad in heart, shall I?
How long exalted over me
Shall be mine enemy?
O Lord my God, consider well,
And answer to me make:
Mine eyes enlighten, lest the sleep
Of death me overtake:
Lest that mine enemy should say,
Against him I prevailed;
And those that trouble me rejoice,
When I am moved and failed.
But I have all my confidence
Thy mercy set upon;
My heart within me shall rejoice
In Thy salvation.
I will unto the Lord my God
Sing praises cheerfully,
Because He hath His bounty shown
To me abundantly.

How lost was my condition
Till Jesus made me whole!
There is but one physician
Can cure a sin-sick soul
Next door to death he found me,
And snatched me from the grave,
To tell all around me
His wond'rous pow'r to save.
The worst of all diseases
Is light compared with sin;
On ev'ry part it seizes,
But rages most within;
'Tis palsy, plague, and fever,
And madness--all combined;
And none, but a believer,
The least relief can find.
From men, great skill professing,
I sought a cure to gain;
But this proved more distressing,
And added to my pain;
Some said that nothing ailed me,
Some gave me up for lost;
Thus ev'ry refuge failed me,
And all my hopes were crossed.
At length this great Physician,
How matchless is His grace!
Accepted my petition,
And undertook my case;
First, gave me sight to view him,
For sin my eyes had sealed--
Then bit me look unto Him;
I looked, and I was healed.
A dying, risen Jesus,
Seen by the eye of faith,
At once from danger frees us,
And saves the soul from death;
Come, then, to this Physician,
His help he'll freely give,
He makes no hard condition--
To Jesus look and live.

How lovely are Thy dwellings fair,
O Lord of hosts; how dear
The pleasant tabernacles are
Where Thou dost dwell so near!
Happy, who in Thy house reside,
Where Thee they ever praise!
Happy, whose strength in Thee doth bide,
And in their hearts Thy ways!
They journey on from strength to strength
With joy and gladsome cheer,
Till all before our God at length
In Zion doth appear.
Lord God of hosts that reign’st on high,
That man is truly blest
Who only on Thee doth rely,
And in Thee only rest.

How lovely are Thy tents, O Lord!
Where’er Thou choosest to record
Thy Name, or place Thy house of prayer;
My soul outflies the angel choir,
And faints, o’erpowered with strong desire,
To meet Thy special presence there.
My heart and flesh cry out for God;
There would I fix my soul’s abode,
As birds that in the altars nest;
There would I all my young ones bring,
An offering to my God and King,
And in Thy courts for ever rest.
Happy the men to whom ’tis given,
To dwell within that gate of Heaven,
And in Thy house record Thy praise;
Whose strength and confidence Thou art,
Who feel Thee, Savior, in their heart,
The Way, the Truth, the Life of grace:
Who, passing through the mournful vale,
Drink comfort from the living well,
That flows replenished from above;
From strength to strength advancing here,
Till all before their God appear,
And each receives the crown of love.
Better a day Thy courts within
Than thousands in the tents of sin;
How base the noblest pleasure there!
How great the weakest child of Thine!
His meanest task is all divine,
And kings and priests Thy servants are.
The Lord protects and cheers His own,
Their light and strength, their shield and sun;
He shall both grace and glory give;
Unlimited His bounteous grant;
No real good they e’er shall want;
All, all is theirs, who righteous live.
O Lord of hosts, how blest is he
Who steadfastly believes in Thee!
He all Thy promises shall gain;
The soul that on Thy love is cast
Thy perfect love on earth shall taste,
And soon with Thee in glory reign.

How lovely is Thy dwelling place,
O Lord of hosts to me!
The tabernacles of Thy grace
How pleasant, Lord, they be!
My thirsty soul longs ardently,
Yes, faints Thy courts to see;
My very heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for Thee.
Behold the sparrow findeth out
A house wherein to rest;
The swallow also, for herself,
Provided hath a nest.
Ee’n Thine own altars, where she safe
Her young ones forth may bring,
O Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,
Who art my God and King.
Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,
They ever give Thee praise,
Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,
In whose heart are Thy ways.

How lovely on the mountain,
The feet of those who bring
Glad tidings of salvation,
Thro’ Zion’s glorious King;
Behold, of God anointed,
He comes with pow’r and might,
O regions veiled in darkness,
To pour celestial light.
Lift up thy head, O captive,
And let thy mournings cease;
The hand of mercy waveth
The olive branch of peace.
Lift up thy head, O captive,
For thou, in Christ, shalt find,
A healing balm of comfort,
The broken heart to bind.
O every one that thirsteth
The crystal water see;
To all who will receive it,
The fount of life is free.
Let every one who heareth
Obey the gracious call;
Come, without price, or money,
The Lord has paid for all.

OUR GOD REIGNS 
Clarksboro, NJ 08020 (60423-884Used by permission.
How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
Who brings good news, good news;
Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness:
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
Our God reigns!
Our God reigns!
Our God reigns!
Our God reigns!
He had no stately form, He had no majesty
That we should be drawn to Him.
He was despised and we took no account of Him.
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
It was our sin and guilt that bruised and wounded Him.
It was our sin that brought Him down.
When we like sheep had gone astray our Shepherd came
And on His shoulders bore our shame.
Meek as a lamb that’s led out to the slaughterhouse,
Dumb as a sheep before its shearer,
His life ran down upon the ground like pouring rain
That we might be born again.
Out from the tomb He came with grace and majesty;
He is alive, He is alive.
God loves us so, see here His hands, His feet, His side
Yes we know, He is alive.

How lovely shines the Morning Star!
The nations see and hail afar
The light in Judah shining.
Thou David’s Son of Jacob’s race,
My Bridegroom and my King of Grace,
For Thee my heart is pining.
Lowly, holy, great and glorious,
Thou victorious Prince of graces,
Filling all the heav’nly places.
O highest joy by mortals won,
True Son of God and Mary’s Son,
Thou highborn King of ages!
Thou art my heart’s most beauteous Flower,
And Thy blest Gospel’s saving power
My raptured soul engages.
Thou mine, I Thine; sing hosanna!
Heav’nly manna tasting, eating,
Whilst Thy love in songs repeating.
Now richly to my waiting heart,
O Thou, my God, deign to impart
The grace of love undying.
In Thy blest body let me be,
E’en as the branch is in the tree,
Thy life my life supplying.
Sighing, crying, for the savor
Of Thy favor; resting never
Till I rest in Thee forever.
A pledge of peace from God I see
When Thy pure eyes are turned to me
To show me Thy good pleasure.
Jesus, Thy Spirit and Thy Word,
Thy body and Thy blood afford
My soul its dearest treasure.
Keep me kindly in Thy favor,
O my Savior! Thou wilt cheer me;
Thy Word calls me to draw near Thee.
Thou, mighty Father, in Thy Son
Didst love me ere Thou hadst begun
This ancient world’s foundation.
Thy Son hath made a friend of me,
And when in spirit Him I see,
I joy in tribulation!
What bliss is this! He that liveth
To me giveth life forever;
Nothing me from Him can sever.
Lift up the voice and strike the string,
Let all glad sounds of music ring
In God’s high praises blended.
Christ will be with me all the way,
Today, tomorrow, every day,
Till traveling days be ended.
Sing out, ring out, triumph glorious,
O victorious, chosen nation;
Praise the God of your salvation.
Oh, joy to know that Thou, my Friend,
Art Lord, Beginning without end,
The First and Last, eternal!
And Thou at length—O glorious grace!—
Wilt take me to that holy place,
The home of joys supernal.
Amen, Amen! Come and meet me!
Quickly greet me! With deep yearning
Lord, I look for Thy returning.

How lovely is Thy dwelling place,
O Lord of hosts to me!
The tabernacles of Thy grace
How pleasant, Lord, they be!
My thirsty soul longs ardently,
Yes, faints Thy courts to see;
My very heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for Thee.
Behold the sparrow findeth out
A house wherein to rest;
The swallow also, for herself,
Provided hath a nest.
Ee’n Thine own altars, where she safe
Her young ones forth may bring,
O Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,
Who art my God and King.
Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,
They ever give Thee praise,
Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,
In whose heart are Thy ways.

How lovely, how divinely sweet,
Oh Lord! Thy sacred courts appear;
Fain would my longing passions meet
The glories of Thy presence there.
O bless’d the men, bless’d their employ,
Whom Thy indulgent favors raise
To dwell in those abodes of joy,
And sing Thy never ceasing praise.
Happy the men whom strength divine
With ardent love and zeal inspires;
Whose steps to Thy blest way incline
With willing hearts and warm desires.
One day within Thy sacred gate,
Affords more real joy to me
Than thousands in the tents of state;
The meanest place is bliss with Thee.

How marvelous God’s greatness, how glorious His might!
To this the world bears witness in wonders day and night.
In form of flower and snowflake, in morn’s resplendent birth,
In afterglow at even, in sky and sea and earth.
Each tiny floweret whispers the great life-giver’s Name;
The mighty mountain masses His majesty proclaim;
The hollow vales are hymning God’s shelter for His own;
The snow-capped peaks are pointing to God’s almighty throne.
The ocean’s vast abysses in one grand psalm record
The deep mysterious counsels and mercies of the Lord;
The icy waves of winter are thundering on the strand,
E’en grief’s chill stream is guided by God’s all-gracious hand.
The starry hosts are singing through all the light-strewn sky
Of God’s majestic temple and palace courts on high;
When in these outer chambers such glory gilds the night,
What the transcendent brightness of God’s eternal light!

How oft, alas, this wretched heart
Has wandered from the Lord!
How oft my roving thoughts depart,
Forgetful of his word!
Yet sov'reign mercy calls, "Return!"
Dear Lord, and may I come?
My vile ingratitude I mourn;
O take the wand'rer home!
And canst thou, wilt thou yet forgive,
And bid my crimes remove?
And shall a pardoned rebel live,
To speak thy wondrous love?
Almighty grace, thy healing pow'r,
How glorious, how divine!
That can to life and bliss restore
So vile a heart as mine!
Thy pard'ning love, so free, so sweet
Dear Savior, I adore;
O keep me at thy sacred feet,
And let me rove no more!

How oft in holy converse
With Christ, my Lord, alone,
I seem to hear the millions
That sing around His throne:
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Amen! Amen!
They passed through toils and trials,
And though the strife was long,
They share the victor’s conquest
And sing the victor’s song:
My soul takes up the 
And, pressing on my way,
Communing still with Jesus,
I sing from day to day:
Through grace I soon shall conquer
And reach my home on high;
And through eternal ages
I’ll shout beyond the sky:

We sing of a land where the servants of God
Shall meet when their journey is o’er,
And clasp their glad hands as they gather at morn,
To labor and sorrow no more.
We sing of the beautiful mansions of rest
Our Savior has gone to prepare;
And oh, when we think of the bliss they unfold,
In spirit, how oft we are there.
We sing of a land where the leaves never fall,
A land where their bloom never dies;
And Jesus Himself, with His own loving hand,
Will wipe every tear from our eyes.
We sing of the palms that the conquerors wave,
Who triumphed through Jesus our Lord;
Who fought to the last, and with shouts on their tongues,
Went home to receive their reward.
We sing of the friends who are waiting today
For us in that region so fair;
But who can describe what a joy it will be
To know that indeed we are there?

How oft, O Lord, Thy face hath shone
On doubting souls whose wills were true!
Thou Christ of Cephas and of John,
Thou art the Christ of Thomas, too.
He loved Thee well, and calmly said
“Come, let us go, and die with Him";
Yet when Thine Easter news was spread,
’Mid all its light his eyes were dim.
His brethren’s word he would not take
But craved to touch those hands of Thine:
The bruised reed Thou didst not break;
He saw, and hailed his Lord divine.
He saw Thee ris’n; at once he rose
To full belief’s unclouded height;
And still through his confession flows
To Christian souls Thy life and light.
O Savior, make Thy presence known
To all who doubt Thy Word and Thee;
And teach them in that Word alone
To find the truth that sets them free.
And we who know how true Thou art,
And Thee as God and Lord adore,
Give us, we pray, a loyal heart,
To trust and love Thee more and more.

How pleasant, how divinely fair,
O Lord of hosts, Thy dwellings are!
With long desire my spirit faints
To meet th’assemblies of Thy saints.
My flesh would rest in Thine abode,
My panting heart cries out for God;
My God! my King! why should I be
So far from all my joys and Thee?
The sparrow chooses where to rest
And for her young provides her nest;
But will my God to sparrows grant
That pleasure which His children want?
Bless’d are the saints who sit on high
Around Thy throne of majesty;
Thy brightest glories shine above,
And all their work is praise and love.
Bless’d are the souls who find a place
Within the temple of Thy grace;
There they behold Thy gentler rays,
And seek Thy face, and learn Thy praise.
Bless’d are the men whose hearts are set
To find the way to Sion’s gate;
God is their strength, and through the road
They lean upon their helper God.
Cheerful they walk with growing strength,
Till all shall meet in Heav’n at length,
Till all before Thy face appear,
And join in a nobler worship there.

How pleased and blest was I
To hear the people cry,
“Come, let us seek our God today!"
Yes, with a cheerful zeal
We haste to Zion’s hill,
And there our vows and honors pay.
Zion, thrice happy place,
Adorned with wondrous grace,
And walls of strength embrace thee round;
In thee our tribes appear
To pray, and praise, and hear
The sacred Gospel’s joyful sound.
There David’s greater Son
Has fixed His royal throne,
He sits for grace and judgment there:
He bids the saint be glad,
He makes the sinner sad,
And humble souls rejoice with fear.
May peace attend thy gate,
And joy within thee wait
To bless the soul of every guest!
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wishes thine increase,
A thousand blessings on him rest!
My tongue repeats her vows,
“Peace to this sacred house!"
For there my friends and kindred dwell;
And since my glorious God
Makes thee His blest abode,
My soul shall ever love thee well.

How precious is the book divine,
By inspiration giv’n;
Bright as a lamp its pages shine
To guide our souls to Heav’n.
Its light descending from above,
Our gloomy world to cheer,
Displays a Savior’s boundless love,
And brings His glories near.
Oh precious book of light and life
Thou source of truth and love,
In Thee we view God’s matchless grace,
And all His goodness prove,
Oh precious book whose light e’er shines
With bright and cheering ray,
To guide our souls until the dawn
Of the eternal day.
It shows to man his wand’ring ways,
And where his feet have trod;
And brings to view the matchless grace
Of a forgiving God.
O’er all the straight and narrow way
Its radiant beams are cast;
A light whose never weary ray
Grows brightest at the last.
It sweetly cheers our fainting hearts
In this dark vale of tears;
Life, light and joy it still imparts,
And quells our rising fears.
This lamp, through all the tedious night
Of life, shall guide our way,
Till we behold the clearer light
Of an eternal day.

How precious, Lord, Thy sacred Word,
What light and joy those leaves afford
To souls in deep distress!
Thy precepts guide our doubtful way,
Thy fear forbids our feet to stray,
Thy promise leads to rest.
Thy threat’nings wake our slum’bring eyes,
And warn us where our danger lies;
But ’tis Thy Gospel, Lord,
That makes the guilty conscience clean,
Converts the soul, and conquers sin,
And gives a free reward.

How rich Thy bounty, King of kings!
Thy favors, how divine!
The blessings which Thy Gospel brings,
How splendidly they shine!
Gold is but dross, and gems but toys,
Should gold and gems compare;
How mean, when sent against those joys
Thy poorest servants share!
Yet all these treasures of Thy grace
Are lodged in urns of clay;
And the weak sons of mortal race
The immortal gifts convey.
Feebly they lisp Thy glories forth,
Yet grace the victory gives;
Quickly they molder back to earth,
Yet still Thy Gospel lives.
Such wonders power divine effects;
Such trophies God can raise;
His hand, from crumbling dust, erects
His monuments of praise.

How sad our state by nature is!
Our sin, how deep it stains!
And Satan binds our captive souls
Fast in his slavish chains.
But hark! a voice of sovereign grace
Sounds from the sacred Word;
“Ho, ye despairing sinners, come,
And trust upon the Lord!"
My soul obeys the Almighty’s call,
And runs to this relief;
I would believe Thy promise, Lord;
O help my unbelief!
To the blest fountain of Thy blood,
Incarnate God, I fly;
Here let me wash my spotted soul
From sins of deepest dye.
Stretch out Thine arm, victorious King,
My reigning sins subdue,
Drive the old Dragon from his seat,
With all his hellish crew.
A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,
Into Thy hands I fall;
Be Thou my strength and righteousness,
My Savior, and my all.

How shall I follow Him I serve?
How shall I copy Him I love?
Not from the blessed footsteps swerve,
Which lead me to His seat above?
Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn,
The life of toil, the mean abode,
The faithless kiss, the crown of thorn,
Are these the consecrated road?
’Twas thus He suffered, though a Son,
Foreknowing, choosing, feeling all,
Until the perfect work was done,
And drunk the bitter cup of gall.
Lord, should my path through suffering lie
Forbid it I should e’er repine;
Still let me turn to Calvary,
Nor heed my griefs, remembering Thine.
O let me think how Thou didst leave
Untasted every pure delight,
To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,
The toilsome day, the homeless night.
To faint, to grieve, to die for me!
Thou camest, not Thyself to please;
And, dear as earthly comforts be,
Shall I not love Thee more than these?
Yes, I would count them all but loss,
To gain the notice of Thine eye:
Flesh shrinks and trembles at the cross,
But Thou canst give the victory.

How Shall I My Savior Set Forth?
How shall I His beauties declare?
Or how shall I speak of His worth,
Or what His chief dignities are?
His angels can never express,
Nor saints who sit nearest His throne,
How rich are His treasures of grace,
No! This is a myst'ry unknown.
In Him all the fullness of God
Forever transcendently shines;
Though one like a mortal he stood,
To finish His gracious designs;
Though once He was nailed to the cross,
Vile rebels like me to set free,
His glory sustained no loss,
Eternal His kingdom shall be.
His wisdom, His love, and His pow'r
Seemed then with each other to vie,
When sinners he stooped to restore,
Poor sinners condemned to die!
He laid all His grandeur aside,
And dwelt in a cottage of clay;
Poor sinners he loved till he died,
To wash their pollution away.
O sinners believe and adore
This Savior so rich to redeem;
No creature can ever explore
The treasures of goodness in Him.
Come, all ye who see yourselves lost,
And feel yourselves burdened with sin,
Draw near, while with terror you're tossed,
Believe, and your peace shall begin.

How shall I sing that Majesty
Which angels do admire?
Let dust in dust and silence lie;
Sing, sing, ye heavenly choir.
Thousands of thousands stand around
Thy throne, O God most high;
Ten thousand times ten thousand sound
Thy praise; but who am I?
Thy brightness unto them appears,
Whilst I Thy footsteps trace;
A sound of God comes to my ears,
But they behold Thy face.
They sing because Thou art their Sun;
Lord, send a beam on me;
For where heaven is but once begun
There alleluias be.
Enlighten with faith’s light my heart,
Inflame it with love’s fire;
Then shall I sing and bear a part
With that celestial choir.
I shall, I fear, be dark and cold,
With all my fire and light;
Yet when Thou dost accept their gold,
Lord, treasure up my mite.
How great a being, Lord, is Thine,
Which doth all beings keep!
Thy knowledge is the only line
To sound so vast a deep.
Thou art a sea without a shore,
A sun without a sphere;
Thy time is now and evermore,
Thy place is everywhere.

How shall the young direct their way?
What light shall be their perfect guide?
Thy Word, O Lord, will safely lead,
If in its wisdom they confide.
Sincerely I have sought Thee, Lord,
O let me not from Thee depart;
To know Thy will and keep from sin
Thy Word I cherish in my heart.
O blessed Lord, teach me Thy law,
Thy righteous judgments I declare;
Thy testimonies make me glad,
For they are wealth beyond compare.
Upon Thy precepts and Thy ways
My heart will meditate with awe;
Thy Word shall be my chief delight,
And I will not forget Thy law.

How shall the young secure their hearts
And guard their lives from sin?
Thy Word the choicest rules imparts
To keep the conscience clean.
When once it enters to the mind,
It spreads such light abroad,
The meanest souls instruction find,
And raise their thoughts to God.
’Tis, like the sun, a heav’nly light
That guides us all the day,
And through the dangers of the night
A lamp to lead our way.
The men that keep Thy law with care,
And meditate Thy Word,
Grow wiser than their teachers are,
And better know the Lord.
Thy precepts make me truly wise:
I hate the sinner’s road;
I hate my own vain thoughts that rise,
But love Thy law, my God.
The starry heav’ns Thy rule obey,
The earth maintains her place;
And these Thy servants, night and day,
Thy skill and power express.
But still Thy law and Gospel, Lord,
Have lessons more divine;
Not earth stands firmer than Thy Word,
Nor stars so nobly shine.
Thy Word is everlasting truth;
How pure is every page!
That holy Book shall guide our youth
And well support our age.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How shall we answer terror’s cry,
The cunning blade, the flaming sky?
When murderous spite knocks down our door
And violence breaks upon our shore,
O let us come and look to You
To know Your will—what shall we do?
When Satan whispers, “Hate your foe,
Now take your vengeance—draw the bow,"
Protect us from the tempter’s guile,
The lying voice, the evil smile.
O let us come in trust to You,
To hear the word we know is true.
When executioners hung You high
You turned Your prayer up to the sky,
And pled the Father to forgive,
You asked that cruel men might live.
O let us Your example take,
And pray for sinners as we ache.
We pray that You their hearts will turn;
And light a holy fire to burn
Their dross away, so they may be
Like gold refined, eternally.
O let us pray that they become,
Like us, with You forever one.

How strong and sweet my Father’s care,
That round about me, like the air,
Is with me always, everywhere!
He cares for me!
The thought great wonder with it brings,
My cares are all such little things,
But to the truth my glad heart clings,
He cares for me!
O keep me ever in Thy love,
Dear Father, watching from above,
And as through life my steps shall move,
O care for me.

How sweet and awesome is this place
[originally How sweet and aweful is the place]
With Christ within the doors,
While everlasting love displays
The choicest of her stores!
Here every bowel of our God
With soft compassion rolls;
Here peace and pardon bought with blood
Is food for dying souls.
While all our hearts and all our songs
Join to admire the feast,
Each of us cry, with thankful tongues,
“Lord, why was I a guest?
“Why was I made to hear Thy voice,
And enter while there’s room,
When thousands make a wretched choice,
And rather starve than come?"
’Twas the same love that spread the feast
That sweetly drew us in;
Else we had still refused to taste,
And perished in our sin.
Pity the nations, O our God!
Constrain the earth to come;
Send Thy victorious Word abroad,
And bring the strangers home.
We long to see Thy churches full,
That all the chosen race
May with one voice, and heart and soul,
Sing Thy redeeming grace.

How sweet and silent is the place,
My God, alone, with Thee!
Awaiting here Thy touch of grace,
Thy heav’nly mystery.
So many ways Thou hast, dear Lord,
My longing heart to fill:
Thy lovely world, Thy spoken word,
The doing Thy sweet will.
Giving Thy children living bread,
Leading Thy weak ones on,
The touch of dear hands on my head,
The thought of loved ones gone.
Lead me by many paths, dear Lord,
But always in Thy way;
And let me make my earth a Heav’n
Till next communion day.

How sweet and silent is the place,
My God, alone, with Thee!
Awaiting here Thy touch of grace,
Thy heav’nly mystery.
So many ways Thou hast, dear Lord,
My longing heart to fill:
Thy lovely world, Thy spoken word,
The doing Thy sweet will.
Giving Thy children living bread,
Leading Thy weak ones on,
The touch of dear hands on my head,
The thought of loved ones gone.
Lead me by many paths, dear Lord,
But always in Thy way;
And let me make my earth a Heav’n
Till next communion day.

How sweet is the comfort and rest of my soul,
Where peace doth so tranquilly flow;
Though storm-cloud and tempest and dark billows roll,
All my heart with His sunlight doth glow.
How sweet is my rest! And how richly I’m blest!
Oh, how sweet is the rest of my soul! 
No fears shall alarm me though Satan be nigh,
He’s subject to Jesus’ control;
Though tempted and tried, Christ regardeth my cry,
Truly He is the joy of my soul.
My sins all are gone, oh, what rapture to know
They’re nailed to the cross where He died;
The blood doth atone and my heart doth o’erflow,
Praise the Lord for the soul-cleansing tide! 
I’m saved even now, and though death soon may come,
No harm shall it bring to my soul;
For all it can do is to carry me home,
To be safe while the ages shall roll.

How sweet is my walk with Jesus!
What blessings He breathes on me!
We walk in the golden morning—
And, oh, how my soul is free!—
And onward together journey,
As swiftly the moments fly;
I sing of His love at evening,
As twilight illumes the sky.
Oh, sweet is my walk with Jesus!
How gently He smiles on me!
Yet, nearer, my Lord so precious,
Oh, help me to walk with Thee.
How sweet is my walk with Jesus!
His whispers of peace I hear;
His banner of love is o’er us,
And angels are hov’ring near;
I walk in the light with Jesus,
He shines in the narrow way;
The shadows of sin are vanished,
I walk in the light of day.
How sweet is my walk with Jesus!
I love all the way He trod;
Embraced in His sweet communion,
I’ll walk with the Son of God;
I turn from the paths of pleasure,
And closer to Jesus press;
I’ll walk with my dear Redeemer,
In His perfect holiness.

How sweet is the love of my Savior!
’Tis boundless and deep as the sea;
And best of it all, it is daily
Growing sweeter and sweeter to me.
Sweeter and sweeter to me,
Dearer and dearer each day;
Oh, wonderful love of my Savior,
Growing dearer each step of my way!
I know He is ever beside me!
Eternity only will prove
The height and the depth of His mercy,
And the breadth of His infinite love.
Wherever He leads I will follow,
Thru sorrow, or shadow or sun;
And though I be tried in the furnace,
I can say, “Lord, Thy will be it done."
Some day face to face I shall see Him,
And oh, what a joy it will be
To know that His love, now so precious,
Will forever grow sweeter to me!

How sweet the hour of praise and prayer,
When our devotions blend,
And on the wings of faith divine
Our songs of joy ascend!
’Tis then we hear in tones more clear
The gracious promise giv’n,
That, though we part from friends on earth,
We all shall meet in Heav’n.
We all shall meet in Heav’n at last,
We all shall meet in Heav’n;
Through faith in Jesus’ precious blood,
We all shall meet in Heav’n.
How sweet the tie of hallowed love
That binds our hearts in one;
When gathered in the blessed Name
Of Christ, the Father’s Son!
And though the parting soon may come,
Yet in His Word is giv’n
The blessed hope that by and by
We all shall meet in Heav’n.
Yes, soon our worn and weary feet
Will reach the golden strand,
Where those we love our coming wait
In yonder summerland;
A few more days, a few more years,
By storm and tempest driv’n,
With songs and everlasting joy
We all shall meet in Heav’n.

How sweet the hour of closing day,
When all is peaceful and serene,
And when the sun, with cloudless ray,
Sheds mellow luster o’er the scene!
Such is the Christian’s parting hour;
So peacefully he sinks to rest,
When faith, endued from Heav’n with power, 
Sustains and cheers his languid breast.
Mark but that radiance of his eye,
That smile upon his wasted cheek;
They tell us of his glory nigh,
In language that no tongue can speak.
A beam from Heav’n is sent to cheer
The pilgrim on his gloomy road;
And angels are attending near,
To bear him to their bright abode.
Who would not wish to die like those
Whom God’s own Spirit deigns to bless?
To sink into that soft repose,
Then wake to perfect happiness?

How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary, rest.
Dear Name, the Rock on which I build,
My Shield and Hiding Place,
My never failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace!
By Thee my prayers acceptance gain,
Although with sin defiled;
Satan accuses me in vain,
And I am owned a child.
Jesus! my Shepherd, Husband, Friend,
O Prophet, Priest and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.
Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.
Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath,
And may the music of Thy Name
Refresh my soul in death!

How sweet to reflect on the joys that await me
In yon blissful region, the haven of rest
Where glorified spirits in raptures will greet me.
And lead me to mansions prepared for the blessed.
Encircled with light and with glory enshrouded.
My happiness perfect, my mind's eye above
I'll bathe in the ocean of mercies unbounded
And range with delight through the Eden of love.
While angelic legions with harps tuned celestial
Harmoniously join in the concert of praise.
Any saints as they flock from the region terrestrial
In loud hallelujahs their voices shall raise.
This song of redemption is echoed in heaven
My soul would respond in Immanuel's love
"All glory, all honor, all might and dominion
To him who brought us to the Eden of love."
Then hail, blessed state, hail, ye songsters of glory
Ye harpers of bliss, soon I'll meet you above.
To join your full choir in rehearsing the story
Salvation from sorrow through Jesus' love.
Through prisoned on earth, yet by anticipation
Already my soul tastes the sweets from my Love.
Of joys that await me when freed from this station
My heart's now in heaven, the Eden of Love.

How sweet, how heavenly is the sight,
When those that love the Lord
In one another’s peace delight,
And so fulfill His Word!
When each can feel his brother’s sigh
And with him bear a part!
When sorrow flows from eye to eye,
And joy from heart to heart!
When, free from envy, scorn, and pride,
Our wishes all above,
Each can his brother’s failings hide,
And show a brother’s love!
When love, in one delightful stream,
Through every bosom flows,
When union sweet, and dear esteem,
In every action glows.
Love is the golden chain that binds
The happy souls above;
And he’s an heir of Heaven who finds
His bosom glow with love.

How sweetly flowed the Gospel’s sound
From lips of gentleness and grace
While listening thousands gathered round,
And joy and gladness filled the place!
From Heaven He came, of Heaven He spoke,
To Heaven He led His followers’ way;
Dark clouds of gloomy night He broke,
Unveiling an immortal day.
“Come, wanderers, to My Father’s home;
Come, all ye weary ones, and rest."
Yes, sacred Teacher, we will come,
Obey Thee, love Thee, and be blest.
Decay, then, tenements of dust!
Pillars of earthly pride, decay!
A nobler mansion waits the just,
And Jesus has prepared the way.

How sweetly o’er the mountain of Zion, lovely Zion,
The anthem of ages comes sweeping along;
The anthem of the faithful, we hear, and, rejoicing,
Our hearts in glad measure keep tune with the song.
O the Lion of Judah hath triumphed forever,
O the Lion of Judah is mighty and strong.
O happy, happy tidings, the kingdom now is opened,
The seals are all broken; proclaim it afar;
From bondage and oppression by Him we are delivered,
The Lion of Judah, the bright Morning Star.
Hosanna in the highest, all glory everlasting,
The cross and its banner triumphant shall wave;
Hosanna in the highest, all glory everlasting,
The Lion of Judah His people will save.

How tedious and tasteless the hours
When Jesus I no longer see;
Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flowers,
Have all lost their sweetness to me;
The midsummer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay.
But when I am happy in Him,
December’s as pleasant as May.
His Name yields the richest perfume,
And sweeter than music His voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice.
I should, were He always thus nigh,
Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal as happy as I,
My summer would last all the year.
Content with beholding His face,
My all to His pleasure resigned,
No changes of season or place
Would make any change in my mind:
While blessed with a sense of His love,
A palace a toy would appear;
All prisons would palaces prove,
If Jesus would dwell with me there.
Dear Lord, if indeed I am Thine,
If Thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I languish and pine?
And why are my winters so long?
O drive these dark clouds from the sky,
Thy soul cheering presence restore;
Or take me to Thee up on high,
Where winter and clouds are no more.

O I love to tell the blessed story
Since the Lord sanctified me;
For my soul received a flood of glory
When the Lord sanctified me.
O I never shall forget how the fire fell,
How the fire fell, how the fire fell.
O I never shall forget how the fire fell
When the Lord sanctified me.
All my doubts and fears are gone forever
Since the Lord sanctified me;
For His peace flowed o’er me like a river
When the Lord sanctified me.
To the world no more my heart is turning
Since the Lord sanctified me;
For on me His Spirit fell with burning
When the Lord sanctified me.
There’s a crown awaiting me in Heaven
Since the Lord sanctified me;
For a heart made clean to me was given
When the Lord sanctified me.

I love to hear the story how the Lord from Heaven came
And did not fear to visit men in all their sin and shame;
But touched the sick and made them well, the blind and they did see,
And said of little children, “Suffer them to come to Me."
I love to think of Jesus as my gentle Shepherd Lord
Who leads in heav’nly pastures those who love to hear His Word;
And when I am in sorrow, and sore trouble makes me fear,
I hear Him say: “Be not afraid, My child, for I am near!"
I love to speak to Him alone in words of song and prayer
In darkest night and roughest way, for He is with me there;
And so He guides me that each day I may not fail to see
The way to Heav’n, that where He is, there also may I be.

How to reach the masses, men of every birth,
For an answer, Jesus gave the key:
“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."
Lift Him up, Lift Him up,
Still He speaks from eternity:
“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."
Oh! the world is hungry for the Living Bread,
Lift the Savior up for them to see;
Trust Him, and do not doubt the words that He said,
“I’ll draw all men unto Me."
Don’t exalt the preacher, don’t exalt the pew,
Preach the Gospel simple, full and free;
Prove Him and you will find that promise is true,
“I’ll draw all men unto Me."
Lift Him up by living as a Christian ought,
Let the world in you the Savior see;
Then men will gladly follow Him Who once taught,
“I’ll draw all men unto Me."

How vain the cruel Herod’s fear,
When told that Christ the King is near!
He takes not earthly realms away,
Who gives the realms that ne’er decay.
The Eastern sages saw from far
And followed on His guiding star;
By light their way to Light they trod,
And by their gifts confessed their God.
Within the Jordan’s sacred flood
The heavenly Lamb in meekness stood,
That He to Whom no sin was known,
Might cleanse His people from their own.
And oh, what miracle divine,
When water reddened into wine!
He spake the word, and forth it flowed
In streams that nature ne’er bestowed.
All glory, Jesu, be to Thee
For this Thy glad Epiphany:
Whom with the Father we adore
And Holy Ghost forevermore.

How vast the benefits divine which we in Christ possess!
We are redeemed from guilt and shame and called to holiness.
But not for works which we have done, or shall hereafter do,
Hath God decreed on sinful men salvation to bestow.
The glory, Lord, from first to last, is due to Thee alone;
Aught to ourselves we dare not take, or rob Thee of Thy crown.
Our glorious Surety undertook to satisfy for man,
And grace was given us in Him before the world began.
This is Thy will, that in Thy love we ever should abide;
That earth and hell should not prevail to turn Thy Word aside.
Not one of all the chosen race but shall to Heav’n attain,
Partake on earth the purposed grace and then with Jesus reign.

How welcome was the call,
And sweet the festal lay,
When Jesus deigned in Cana’s hall
To bless the marriage day!
And happy was the bride,
And glad the bridegroom’s heart,
For He Who tarried at their side
Bade grief and ill depart.
His gracious power divine
The water vessels knew;
And plenteous was the mystic wine
The wondering servants drew.
O Lord of life and love,
Come Thou again today;
And bring a blessing from above
That ne’er shall pass away.
O bless, as erst of old,
The bridegroom and the bride;
Bless with the holier stream that flowed
Forth from Thy pierced side.
Before Thine altar throne
This mercy we implore;
As Thou dost knit them, Lord, in one,
So bless them evermore.

How wonderful it is to walk with God
Along the road that holy men have trod;
How wonderful it is to hear Him say:
Fear not, have faith, ’tis I who lead the way!
How wonderful it is to talk with God
When cares sweep o’er my spirit like a flood;
How wonderful it is to hear His voice,
For when He speaks the desert lands rejoice!
How wonderful it is to praise my God,
Who comforts and protects me with His rod;
How wonderful to praise him every hour,
My heart attuned to sing His wondrous power!
How wonderful it is to fight for God,
And point poor sinners to the precious blood;
How wonderful it is to wield His sword
’Gainst sin, the enemy of Christ, my Lord!
How wonderful ’twill be to live with God
When I have crossed death’s deep and swelling flood;
How wonderful to see Him face to face
When I have fought the fight and won the race!

How wondrous and great
Thy works, God of praise!
How just, King of saints,
And true are Thy ways!
O who shall not fear Thee,
And honor Thy Name?
Thou only art holy,
Thou only supreme.
To nations long dark
Thy light shall be shown;
Their worship and vows
Shall come to Thy throne:
Thy truth and Thy judgments
Shall spread all abroad,
Till earth’s every people
Confess Thee their God.

How wondrous and great
Thy works, God of praise!
How just, King of saints,
And true are Thy ways!
O who shall not fear Thee,
And honor Thy Name?
Thou only art holy,
Thou only supreme.
To nations long dark
Thy light shall be shown;
Their worship and vows
Shall come to Thy throne:
Thy truth and Thy judgments
Shall spread all abroad,
Till earth’s every people
Confess Thee their God.

How beauteous on the mountains
The feet of him that brings,
Like streams from living fountains,
Good tidings of good things;
That publishes salvation;
From error gives release
To every tribe and nation:
God’s reign of joy and peace.
Break forth in hymns of gladness,
O waste Jerusalem;
Let songs instead of sadness,
Thy jubilee proclaim;
The Lord, in strength victorious,
Upon thy foes has trod;
Behold, O earth, the glorious
Salvation of our God.

How beautiful, the hands that served the wine and the bread,
and the sons of the earth.
How beautiful, the feet that walked the long dusty roads, and
the hill to the cross.
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful,
is the body of Christ.
How beautiful, the heart that bled, that took all my sin and
bore it instead.
How beautiful, the tender eyes that choose to forgive and
never despise.
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, is the body of Christ.
And as He laid down His life.We offer this sacrifice,
that we will live, just as He died.
Willing to pay, to pay the price, willing to pay the price.
How beautiful, the radiant bride, who waits for her Groom with
His light in her eyes.
How beautiful, when humble hearts give the fruit of pure lives
so that others may live.
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, is the body of Christ.
How beautiful, the feet that bring the sound of good news, and
the love of the King.
How beautiful, the hands that serve the wine and the bread,
and the sons of the earth.
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, is the body of Christ.

How brightly beams the Morning Star!
What sudden radiance from afar
Doth glad us with its shining,
Brightness of God that breaks our night
And fills the darkened souls with light
Who long for truth were pining!
Thy Word, Jesu, inly feeds us,
Rightly leads us, life bestowing;
Praise, oh praise such love o’erflowing.
Thou here my Comfort, there my Crown,
Thou King of Heav’n, who camest down
To dwell as man beside me;
My heart doth praise Thee o’er and o’er,
If Thou art mine I ask no more,
Be wealth or fame denied me;
Thee I seek now; none who proves Thee,
None who loves Thee finds Thee fail him;
Lord of life, Thy powers avail him!
Through Thee alone can I be blest,
Then deep be on my heart impressed
The love that Thou hast borne me;
So make it ready to fulfill
With burning zeal Thy holy will,
Though men may vex or scorn me;
Savior, let me never lose Thee,
For I choose Thee, thirst to know Thee;
All I am and have I owe Thee!
O God, our Father far above,
Thee too I praise for all the love
Thou in Thy Son dost give me!
In Him am I made one with Thee,
My Brother and my Friend is He;
Shall aught affright or grieve me?
He is Greatest, Best, and Highest,
Ever nighest to the weakest;
Fear no foes, if Him thou seekest!
O praise to Him who came to save,
Who conquered death and burst the grave;
Each day new praise resoundeth
To Him the Lamb who once was slain,
The Friend whom none shall trust in vain,
Whose grace for aye aboundeth;
Sing, ye heavens, tell the story
Of His glory, till His praises
Flood with light Earth’s darkest places.

O Saviour, as my eyes behold
The wonders of Thy might untold,
The heav'ns in glorious light arrayed,
The vast creation Thou hast made—
And yet to think Thou lovest me—
My heart cries out, "How can it be?"
How can it be? How can it be?
That God should love a soul like me,
O how can it be?
As at the cross I humbly bow
And gaze upon Thy thorn-crowned brow,
And view the precious bleeding form
By cruel nails so bruised and torn,
Knowing Thy suff'ring was for me,
In grief I cry, "How can it be?"
How can it be? How can it be?
Was ever grace so full and free!
From heights of bliss to depths of woe
In loving kindness Thou didst go,
From sin and shame to rescue me—
O Love Divine, How can it be? 

How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure
That he should give his only son, to make a wretch his treasure
How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turned his face away
As wounds which mar the chosen one, bring many sons to glory
Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers
It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life; I know that it is finished
I will not boast in anything: no gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ; his death and resurrection
Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart: his wounds have paid my ransom
Album: I Could Sing of Your Love Forever 2

How long has it been, since you talked to the Lord,
And told Him your heart's hidden secrets?
How long since you prayed,
How long since you stayed,
On your knees 'til the light shone through? 
How long has it been since your mind felt at ease,
How long since your heart knew no burden?
Can you call Him your friend,
How long has it been,
Since you knew that He cared for you? 
How long has it been since you knelt by your bed,
And prayed to the Lord up in Heaven?
How long since you knew,
That He'd answer you,
And would keep you the long night through? 
How long has it been since you woke with the dawn,
And felt that the day's worth the living?
Can you call Him your friend,
How long has it been,
Since you knew that He cared for you? 
How long has it been since you talked with the Lord,
And told Him your heart's hidden secrets?
How long since you prayed,
How long since you stayed,
On your knees 'til the light shone through? 
How long has it been since you woke with the dawn,
And felt that the days' worth the living?
Can you call Him your friend?
How long has it been,
Since you knew that He cared for you?

Humble Souls, Who Seek Salvation
Through the Lamb's redeeming blood,
Hear the voice of revelation,
Tread the path that Jesus trod;
Flee to Him your only Savior,
In His mighty name confide;
In the whole of your behavior,
Own Hum as your sov'reign guide.
Hear the bless'd Redeemer call you,
Listen to His gracious voice;
Dread no ills that can befall you
While you make His way your choice;
Jesus says, "Let each believer
Be baptized in my name;"
He Himself in Jordan's river
Was immersed beneath the stream.
Plainly here His footsteps tracing,
Follow Him without delay;
Gladly His command embracing,
Lo! Your Captain leads the way.
View the rite with understanding,
Jesus' grave before you lies;
Be interred at His commanding
After His example rise.

Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord;
Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord.
And He (And He) shall lift (shall lift)
You up (higher and higher)
And He (And He) shall lift (shall lift) you up.
Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord;

You up (higher and higher)
And He (And He) shall lift (shall lift) you up.
And He (And He) shall lift (shall lift)
You up (up into heaven)
And He (And He) shall lift (shall lift) you up

If thou wouldst have the dear Savior from heaven
Walk by thy side from the morn till the even,
There is a rule that each day you must follow:
Humble thyself to walk with God.
Humble thyself and the Lord will draw near thee,
Humble thyself and His presence shall cheer thee;
He will not walk with the proud or the scornful,
Humble thyself to walk with God.
Just as the Lord, in the world’s early ages,
Walked and communed with the prophets and sages,
He will come now if you meet the conditions:
Humble thyself to walk with God.
Just as the stream finds a bed that is lowly,
So Jesus walks with the pure and the holy;
Cast out thy pride, and in heartfelt contrition
Humble thyself to walk with God.

Humble yourself in the sight of the Lord (Humble yourself in the sight of the 
Lord)

Lord)
And He (and He) will lift (will lift) you up
And He (and He) will lift (will lift) you up

I've a request to make if I could dear Lord
It makes me ache to see the way we quarrel
We've got so much to do
We've got to tell the world about you (we've got to tell the world)
And if you could only see us through tomorrow
We've got brothers fighting brothers
And sisters who don't even talk
I know it's not the way You planned our walk together here
We've got to help each other or we're never gonna make it there
I'm begging You please (begging You please), on my knees (on my knees)
Humbly
We're fighting over little things, it's doing nobody good
Why can't we stop judging one another
It comes down to love
And being more like You
So that we can all be one and love each other
Jesus wept over Jerusalem and I'm crying out today
I don't what else I can do but pray
While we fight amongst ourselves the whole world goes by (keeps passing by)
And most of them don't know the name of Jesus (Jesus)
It's got to start with you
And it's got to start with me
I'm begging you please
Humbly

Humility, thou secret vale,
Unknown to proud in heart;
Where show’rs of blessing never fail,
And glories ne’er depart.
Oh, make thy blest abode with me,
Thou angel of the sky;
If I may ever dwell with thee,
My soul shall never die.
Humility, how pure thy place!
Thou seat of holiness!
Thou door of entrance into grace
And everlasting bliss! 
Humility, how calm the breast
That knows thy peace sublime!
Within thy courts our perfect rest
Grows sweeter all the time.
Humility, thou shoreless sea
Of perfect love so deep!
Thy crystal waters cover me,
My helpless soul to keep.

There is a grace few mortals find,
A star all heaven loves to see;
It is a meek and lowly mind,
The gem of pure humility.
No ornament on earth so rare,
No jewel in all heaven’s mart,
Can beautify a soul so fair
As deep humility of heart.
O God, hath e’er Thy balance weighed
A jewel of such priceless worth
As that pure life all humbly laid
Before the blessed Lord of earth? 
Within my hidden man, dear Lord,
That glorious ornament bestow,
The sweetest gift in all Thy Word—
O Father, keep me meek and low.
All earthly crowns shall turn to mold,
All glitt’ring pride and vanity;
But meekness decks the soul with gold
That shines through all eternity.

Hungry, and faint, and poor,
Behold us, Lord again
Assembled at thy mercy's door,
Thy bounty to obtain.
Thy word invites us nigh,
Or we must starve indeed;
For we no money have to buy,
No righteousness to plead.
The food our spirit want,
Thy hand alone can give;
O, hear the prayer of faith, and grant
That we may eat and live.

’Twas in the moon of wintertime,
When all the birds had fled,
That mighty Gitchi Manitou
Sent angel choirs instead;
Before their light the stars grew dim,
And wondering hunters heard the hymn:
Jesus your King is born,
Jesus is born,
In excelsis gloria.
Within a lodge of broken bark
The tender babe was found,
A ragged robe of rabbit skin
Enwrapped His beauty round;
But as the hunter braves drew nigh,
The angel song rang loud and high:
The earliest moon of wintertime
Is not so round and fair
As was the ring of glory on
The helpless Infant there.
The chiefs from far before Him knelt
With gifts of fox and beaver pelt.
O children of the forest free,
O seed of Manitou,
The holy Child of earth and Heav’n
Is born today for you.
Come kneel before the radiant Boy,
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy.

“Ask, and it shall be given you," brother,
He is the Lord, who careth for all;
Come with your heart all broken and bleeding,
Come, He will hear and answer your call.
Hurry and tell Him, brother and sister;
Jesus, so tender, loving and kind,
Waiting to comfort, bless and deliver;
Hurry and tell Him, peace you will find.
Hurry and tell Him, why do you tarry?
Open your heart while Jesus is near;
Bring Him the burdens you cannot carry,
Tell Him with courage, nothing to fear.
Hurry and tell what tongue cannot utter,
Groaning and sighing, loaded with care;
Bruised and weak with doubting, you falter;
Tell Him, He waits your burdens to bear.
Hurry and tell Him every affliction,
Tell Him each pain and sorrow of heart;
Here is the word, “All power is given";
“Lo, I am with you," never to part.

I was playing tag outside with some kids down the street
Didn’t notice it was getting dark; heard her call for me
Hurry home, I’ve been waiting here for you
Hurry home, there’s so much we’ve got to do
The light is on, the table’s set, and I’ve been worried half to death
Waiting here for you so hurry home
Years later I went off to school, I couldn’t wait to leave
Missing home when I called her up, here’s what she said to me
Got the call, it was almost noon, they said you’d better run
Her body had just given out, she asked to see her son
As I stood there silently, stroked her hair and felt her leave
Thought I could here my momma plead
Hurry home, I’ve been waiting here for you
Hurry home, there’s so much we’ve got to do
The light is on, the table’s set, don't be worried 'bout my death
I'll be waiting here for you so hurry home
The light is on, the table’s set, don't be worried about death
I'll be waiting here when you get home
I'll be waiting here when you get home

Hush, my babe, lie still and slumber,
Holy angels guard thy bed,
Heav’nly blessings without number,
Gently falling on they head.
How much better thou art attended,
Than the Son of God could be,
When from heaven He descended,
And became a child like thee!
Soft and easy is thy cradle,
Coarse and hard thy Savior lay:
When His birthplace was a stable,
And His softest bed was hay.
Oh, to tell the wondrous story,
How His foes abused their King;
How they killed the Lord of glory,
Makes me angry while I sing.
Hush, my child, I did not chide thee,
Though my song may seem so hard;
Tis thy mother sits beside thee,
And her arms shall be thy guard.
May'st thou learn to know and fear Him,
Love and serve Him all thy days;
Then to dwell forever near Him,
Tell His love and sing His praise.

Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,
Holy angels guard thy bed,
Heav’nly blessings without number,
Gently falling on they head.
How much better thou’rt attended,
Than the Son of God could be,
When from Heaven He descended,
And became a child like thee!
Soft and easy is thy cradle,
Coarse and hard thy Savior lay:
When His birthplace was a stable,
And His softest bed was hay.
Oh, to tell the wondrous story,
How His foes abused their King;
How they killed the Lord of glory,
Makes me angry while I sing.
Hush, my child, I did not chide thee,
Though my song may seem so hard;
’Tis thy mother sits beside thee,
And her arms shall be thy guard.
May’st thou learn to know and fear Him,
Love and serve Him all thy days;
Then to dwell forever near Him,
Tell His love and sing His praise.

Hush! blessed are the dead
In Jesus’ arms who rest,
And lean their weary head
Forever on His breast.
O beatific sight!
No darkling veil between,
They see the Light of Light,
Whom here they loved unseen.
Them the Good Shepherd leads,
Where storms are never rife,
In tranquil dewy meads
Beside the Fount of Life.
O tender hearts and true,
Our long last vigil kept,
We weep and mourn for you;
Nor blame us: Jesus wept.
But soon at break of day
His calm almighty voice,
Stronger than death, shall say,
Awake! Arise! Rejoice.

Hush, my soul, what voice is pleading?
Thou canst feel its silent power;
Who is this that speaks so gently
In this solemn evening hour?
“Stay, poor sinner; life is fleeting,
And thy soul is dark within;
Wilt thou wait till outer darkness
Close in gloom thy life of sin?"
Hark! it is a voice of sweetness,
Tenderly it speaks, and true!
Dark and sad, yet strangely yearning,
For a peace I never knew.
Half inclined to stay and listen,
Half inclined to go away;
Still I linger, for it whispers,
“Harden not thy heart today."
What is this that steals beside me?
Can it be that at my side,
In His own mysterious presence,
Stands the wondrous Crucified?
“Why poor sinner, wilt thou linger?
I am waiting to forgive;
See the meaning of these wound prints;
I have died that thou mayest live!"
Hush, my soul! It is thy Savior!
And He seeks His lost one now;
He is waiting, flee not from Him,
Venture near, before Him bow;
Tell Thy sins; He will forgive thee;
And He will not love thee less;
For the human heart of Jesus
Overflows with tenderness.

God is standing by
So hush, don't you worry
Don't cry
God is standing by
So hush, don't you worry
Don't cry 
And when troubles come
Don't cry, no don't cry
When all your dreams
And would be fortunes pass you by
And when there is heartache
So many trials and life's unclear
Just look up toward heaven
There's a God and He's standing near 
And when there is parting
All your friends and loved ones leave you
And you hurt so bad
You feel you just don't know what to do
And if you're wondering if there's anybody who
Really cares
Let me assure you, that there's a God
and He'll be right there 
So hush, don't you worry
Don't cry
Hus.

Hush my little loved one
It's time now to rest
Throughout the day you have given
Each task your best
You'll need strength to face tomorrow
Hush child, time now to rest
You'll need strength to face tomorrow
Hush child, time now to rest
While you are asleep God will watch over you
His guardian angels protecting
His Spirit will soothe
In the morning, when you awaken
We'll be close by your side
In the morning when you awaken
We'll be close by your side
(

Hushed was the evening hymn,
The temple courts were dark;
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark;
When suddenly a voice divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine.
The old man, meek and mild,
The priest of Israel, slept;
His watch the temple child,
The little Levite, kept;
And what from Eli’s sense was sealed
The Lord to Hannah’s son revealed.
O give me Samuel’s ear,
The open ear, O Lord,
Alive and quick to hear
Each whisper of Thy Word,
Like him to answer at Thy call,
And to obey Thee first of all.
O give me Samuel’s heart,
A lowly heart, that waits
Where in Thy house Thou art,
Or watches at Thy gates;
By day and night, a heart that still
Moves at the breathing of Thy will.
O give me Samuel’s mind,
A sweet unmurm’ring faith,
Obedient and resigned
To Thee in life and death,
That I may read with child like eyes
Truths that are hidden from the wise.

In the bulb there is a flower; in the seed, an apple tree;
In cocoons, a hidden promise: butterflies will soon be free!
In the cold and snow of winter there’s a spring that waits to be,
Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.
There’s a song in every silence, seeking word and melody;
There’s a dawn in every darkness, bringing hope to you and me.
From the past will come the future; what it holds, a mystery,
Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.
In our end is our beginning; in our time, infinity;
In our doubt there is believing; in our life, eternity,
In our death, a resurrection; at the last, a victory,
Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.

O God the deep immutable, the changeless, wise and still,
You’re the absolute, eternal One; You wield the sovereign will.
Deep Heav’n itself and even time must bend beneath your sway.
With a whispered thought you banish night in a flash of blinding day.
The seas are boundaried by your word; great mountains heed your call.
Majestic swirls of galaxies adorn your royal hall.
The centuries are lumps of clay shaped by your strength and skill.
You mold the long millennia to the dictates of your will.
The boundless, black-robed skies proclaim your vast, astonishing might:
Their flaming jewels rejoice for you in silent shouts of light.
With sure and sovereign strokes your hands finger the cosmic strings,
And play celestial symphonies as all creation sings.
And silent now, the angels stare; stunned seraphs blush, amazed;
Great Michael sheaths the sword that at the Gate of Eden blazed.
Mighty Gabriel sets his trump aside, and listens to his Lord,
As Love incomprehensible enfleshes the Living Word.
Now space and time have cracked before the size of this event:
The Godhead shudders as the glorious Son to Hell is sent.
Though Very God of Very God, He counts it all but loss,
And comes and suffers as a man, from the manger to the Cross.

I know I love Thee better, Lord
Than any earthly joy,
For Thou hast given me the peace
Which nothing can destroy.
The half has never yet been told,
Of love so full and free;
The half has never yet been told,
The blood—it cleanseth me.
I know that Thou art nearer still
Than any earthly throng.
And sweeter is the thought of Thee
Than any lovely song.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart;
Then well may I be glad!
Without the secret of Thy love
I could not but be sad.
O Savior, precious Savior mine!
What will Thy presence be
If such a life of joy can crown
Our walk on earth with Thee?

Once a sinner far from Jesus,
I was perishing with cold,
But the blessed Savior heard me when I cried;
Then He threw His robe around me,
And He led me to His fold,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side.
Oh, glory be to Jesus, let the hallelujahs roll;
Help me ring the Savior’s praises far and wide,
For I’ve opened up tow’rd heaven
All the windows of my soul,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side.
Tho’ the world may sweep around me
With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven,
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side.
Not for all earth’s golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho’ the tempter to persuade me oft has tried,
For I’m safe in God’s pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side.
Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
’Tis no place for gloomy Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music
And my heart with great delight,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side.
And upon the streets of glory,
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan’s rolling tide,
You will find me shouting “Glory"
Just outside my mansion door
Where I’m living on the hallelujah side.

There is a spot to me more dear
Than native vale or mountain;
A spot for which affection’s tear
Springs grateful from its fountain.
’Tis not where kindred souls abound,
Though that is almost Heaven,
But where I first my Savior found,
And felt my sins forgiven.
Hard was my toil to reach the shore,
Long tossed upon the ocean;
Above me was the thunder’s roar,
Beneath, the wave’s commotion.
Darkly the pall of night was thrown
Around me faint with terror;
In that dark hour how did my groan
Ascend for years of error.
Sinking and panting as for breath
I knew not help was near me;
I cried, “Oh, save me, Lord from death,
Immortal Jesus, hear me."
Then quick as thought I felt Him mine,
My Savior stood before me;
I saw His brightness round me shine,
And shouted “Glory, Glory."
O sacred hour! O hallowed spot!
Where love divine first found me;
Wherever falls my distant lot,
My heart shall linger round thee.
And when from earth I rise, to soar
Up to my home in Heaven,
Down will I cast my eyes once more,
Where I was first forgiven.

The hand that was nailed to the cross of woe,
In love reaches out to the world below;
’Tis beckoning now to the souls that roam,
And pointing the way to the heav’nly home.
The hand of my Savior I see,
The hand that was wounded for me;
’Twill lead me in love to the mansions above,
The hand that was wounded for me!
E’en now I can see, through a mist of tears,
That hand still outstretched o’er the gulf of years,
With healing and hope for my sin sick soul,
One touch of its finger will make me whole!
The hand that wrought wonders in days of old,
Holds treasure more precious than gems or gold,
The price of redemption from sin and shame,
The gift of salvation through Jesus’ Name.

At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords,
While they drank from golden vessels, as the Book of Truth records,
In the night, as they reveled in the royal palace hall,
They were seized with consternation—’twas the Hand upon the wall!
’Tis the hand of God on the wall!
’Tis the hand of God on the wall!
Shall the record be “Found wanting!"
Or shall it be “Found trusting!"
While that hand is writing on the wall?
See the brave captive, Daniel, as he stood before the throne,
And rebuked the haughty monarch for his mighty deeds of wrong;
As he read out the writing—’twas the doom of one and all,
For the kingdom now was finished—said the Hand upon the wall!
See the faith, zeal and courage, that would dare to do the right,
Which the Spirit gave to Daniel—’twas the secret of his might,
In his home in Judea, or a captive in the hall,
He understood the writing of his God upon the wall!
So our deeds are recorded—there’s a Hand that’s writing now:
Sinner, give your heart to Jesus, to His royal mandates bow;
For the day is approaching—it must come to one and all,
When the sinners’ condemnation will be written on the wall!

The happy Christmas comes once more,
The heavenly Guest is at the door,
The blessed words the shepherds thrill,
The joyous tidings, “Peace, good will."
This world, though wide and far outspread,
Could scarcely find for You a bed.
Your cradle was a manger stall,
No pearl nor silk nor kingly hall.
O let us go with quiet mind,
The gentle Babe with shepherds find,
To gaze on Him Who gladdens them,
The loveliest flower of Jesse’s stem.
The lowly Savior meekly lies,
Laid off the splendor of the skies;
No crown bedecks His forehead fair,
No pearl, nor gem, nor silk is there.
O wake, our hearts, in gladness sing,
And keep our Christmas with our King,
Till living song, from loving souls,
Like sound of mighty water rolls.
O holy Child, Thy manger gleams
Till earth and heaven glow with its beams,
Till midnight noon’s broad light hath won,
And Jacob’s star outshines the sun.
Thou patriarchs’ joy, Thou prophets’ song,
Thou heavenly Dayspring, looked for long,
Thou Son of Man, incarnate Word,
Great David’s Son, great David’s Lord.
Come, Jesus, glorious heavenly Guest,
Keep Thine own Christmas in our breast,
Then David’s harp strings, hushed so long,
Shall swell our jubilee of song.

The happy morn is come!
Triumphant o’er the grave,
The Lord hath left the tomb
Omnipotent to save.
Captivity is captive led;
For Jesus liveth that was dead.
Who now accuseth them
For whom their Surety died?
Who now shall those condemn
Whom God hath justified?
Christ hath the ransom paid;
The glorious work is done;
Oh Him our help is laid;
By Him our victory won.
Hail, the triumphant Lord!
Thy resurrection Thou!
We bless Thy sacred Word;
Before Thy throne we bow.

Our life is like a stormy sea
Swept by the gales of sin and grief,
While on the windward and the lee
Hang heavy clouds of unbelief;
But o’er the deep a call we hear,
Like harbor bell’s inviting voice;
It tells the lost that hope is near,
And bids the trembling soul rejoice.
This way, this way, O heart oppressed,
So long by storm and tempest driv’n;
This way, this way, lo here is rest,
Rings out the harbor bell of Heav’n.
O let us now the call obey,
And steer our bark for yonder shore,
Where still that voice directs the way,
In pleading tones forevermore;
A thousand life wrecks strew the sea;
They’re going down at every swell;
“Come unto Me, come unto Me,"
Rings out th’ assuring harbor bell.
O tempted one, look up, be strong;
The promise of the Lord is sure,
That they shall sing the victor’s song,
Who faithful to the end endure;
God’s Holy Spirit comes to thee,
Of His abiding love to tell;
To blissful port, o’er stormy sea,
Calls Heav’n’s inviting harbor bell.
Come, gracious Lord, and in Thy love
Conduct us o’er life’s stormy wave;
O guide us to the home above,
The blissful home beyond the grave;
There safe from rock, and storm, and flood,
Our song of praise shall never cease,
To Him Who bought us with His blood,
And brought us to the port of peace.

The harp at Nature’s advent strung
Has never ceased to play;
The song the stars of morning sung
Has never died away.
And prayer is made, and praise is giv’n,
By all things near and far;
The ocean looketh up to Heav’n,
And mirrors every star.
Its waves are kneeling on the strand,
As kneels the human knee,
Their white locks bowing to the sand,
The priesthood of the sea!
They pour their glittering treasures forth,
Their gifts of pearl they bring,
And all the listening hills of earth
Take up the song they sing.
The green earth sends its incense up
From many a mountain shrine;
From folded leaf and dewy cup
She pours her sacred wine.
The mists above the morning rills
Rise white as wings of prayer;
The altar-curtains of the hills
Are sunset’s purple air.
The winds with hymns of praise are loud,
Or low with sobs of pain—
The thunder-organ of the cloud,
The dropping tears of rain.
With drooping head and branches crossed
The twilight forest grieves,
Or speaks with tongues of Pentecost
From all its sunlit leaves.
The blue sky is the temple’s arch,
Its transept earth and air,
The music of its starry march
The of a prayer.
So Nature keeps the reverent frame
With which her years began,
And all her signs and voices shame
The prayerless heart of man.

My soul in sad exile was out on life’s sea,
So burdened with sin and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice, saying,
“Make Me your choice";
And I entered the “Haven of Rest"!
I’ve anchored my soul in the “Haven of Rest,"
I’ll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep over wild, stormy, deep,
In Jesus I’m safe evermore.
I yielded myself to His tender embrace,
In faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul;
The “Haven of Rest" is my Lord.
The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus, Who’ll save whosoever will have
A home in the “Haven of Rest."
How precious the thought that we all may recline,
Like John, the beloved so blest,
On Jesus’ strong arm, where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the “Haven of Rest."
O come to the Savior, He patiently waits
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul in the “Haven of Rest,"
And say, “My Beloved is mine."

The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now;
A royal diadem adorns
The mighty victor’s brow.
The highest place that Heav’n affords
Belongs to Him by right;
The King of kings and Lord of lords,
And Heaven’s eternal Light.
The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His Name to know.
To them the cross with all its shame,
With all its grace, is given;
Their name an everlasting name,
Their joy the joy of Heaven.
They suffer with their Lord below;
They reign with Him above;
Their profit and their joy to know
The mystery of His love.
The cross He bore is life and health,
Though shame and death to Him,
His people’s hope, His people’s wealth,
Their everlasting theme.

There’s a fountain flowing
From the Savior’s side;
Life and health bestowing,
Since for man He died.
And the Word declareth,
Bathing there is free;
Who is he that dareth
Hinder you and me?
Heav’nly balm it poureth
Into hearts that grieve;
Gladness it restoreth
When earth’s comforts leave.
Oft my heart was sinking
’Neath the load I bore;
Kneeling here, and drinking,
I was strong once more.
By its murm’ring waters
I lie down each night;
When my courage totters
I renews my might.

Oh, the joy of sins forgiv’n,
Oh, the bliss the blood-washed know,
Oh, the peace akin to Heav’n,
Where the healing waters flow.
Where the healing waters flow,
Where the joys celestial glow,
Oh, there’s peace and rest and love,
Where the healing waters flow!
Now with Jesus crucified,
At His feet I’m resting low;
Let me evermore abide
Where the healing waters flow.
O, this precious, perfect love!
How it keeps the heart aglow,
Streaming from the fount above,
Where the healing waters flow.
Oh, to lean on Jesus’ breast,
While the tempests come and go!
Here is blessed peace and rest,
Where the healing waters flow.
Cleansed from every sin and stain,
Whiter than the driven snow,
Now I sing my sweet ,
Where the healing waters flow.

List to the Gospel resounding,
Beautiful message of love;
Jesus, in mercy abounding,
Calleth for you from above.
List to the heavenly voice
Tenderly urging your choice;
Yield to the love of your Savior,
Listen, believe and rejoice.
Why not, O why not, repenting,
Turn from your perilous course,
Ending in woe unrelenting,
Anguish, disgrace and remorse?
Life, like the dew of the morning,
Vanisheth quickly away;
Death bringeth sorrow and mourning,
Wailing forever and aye.
Touched by the Spirit so tender,
Calling as ever before,
Willingly, freely surrender,
Open, yes, open your door.

The heavenly Word proceeding forth,
Yet leaving not the Father’s side,
Accomplishing His work on earth
Had reached at length life’s eventide.
By false disciple to be given
To foemen for His life athirst
Himself, the very Bread of Heav’n,
He gave to His disciples first.
He gave Himself in either kind,
His precious flesh, His precious blood,
In love’s own fullness thus designed
Of the whole man to be the Food.
By birth their fellow man was He;
Their Meat, when sitting at the board;
He died, their Ransomer to be;
He ever reigns, their great Reward.

The heavens declare Thy glory,
The firmament Thy power;
Day unto day the story
Repeats from hour to hour;
Night unto night replying,
Proclaims in every land,
O Lord, with voice undying,
The wonders of Thy hand.
The sun with royal splendor
Goes forth to chant Thy praise;
And moonbeams soft and tender
Their gentler anthem raise;
O’er every tribe and nation
That music strange is poured,
The song of all creation,
To Thee, creation’s Lord.
How perfect, just, and holy
The precepts Thou hast given;
Still making wise the lowly,
They lift the thoughts to heaven;
How pure, how soul restoring
Thy Gospel’s heavenly ray,
A brighter radiance pouring
Than noon of brightest day.
All heaven on high rejoices
To do its Maker’s will;
The stars with solemn voices
Resound Thy praises still;
So let my whole behavior,
Thoughts, words, and actions be,
O Lord, my Strength, my Savior,
One ceaseless song to Thee.

The heav’ns declare Thy glory, Lord,
In every star Thy wisdom shines
But when our eyes behold Thy Word,
We read Thy Name in fairer lines.
The rolling sun, the changing light,
And nights and days, Thy power confess
But the blest volume Thou hast writ
Reveals Thy justice and Thy grace.
Sun, moon, and stars convey Thy praise
Round the whole earth, and never stand:
So when Thy truth begun its race,
It touched and glanced on every land.
Nor shall Thy spreading Gospel rest
Till through the world Thy truth has run,
Till Christ has all the nations blest
That see the light or feel the sun.
Great Sun of Righteousness, arise,
Bless the dark world with heav’nly light;
Thy Gospel makes the simple wise,
Thy laws are pure, Thy judgments right.
Thy noblest wonders here we view
In souls renewed and sins forgiv’n;
Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew,
And make Thy Word my guide to Heaven.

The highest and the holiest place
Guards not the heart from sin;
The Church that safest seems without
May harbor foes within.
Thus in the small and chosen band,
Beloved above the rest,
One fell from his apostleship,
A traitor-soul unblest.
But not the great designs of God
Man’s sins shall over throw;
Another witness to the truth
Forth to the lands shall go.
The soul that sinneth, it shall die;
Thy purpose shall not fail;
The word of grace no less shall sound,
The truth no less prevail.
Righteous, O Lord, are all Thy ways;
Long as the worlds endure,
From foes without and foes within,
Thy Church shall stand secure.

The highest joy that can be known
To those who heav’nward wend—
It is the Word of Life to own,
And God to have as Friend;
It is the Word of Life to own,
And God to have as Friend.
The Word doth give me wealth untold,
All good it has in store;
My deepest sorrows lose their hold
To joys forevermore;
My deepest sorrows loose their hold
To joys forevermore.
How often when in deep despair
My soul has been restored,
And when the tempter would ensnare
’Twould strength to stand afford;
And when the tempter would ensnare
’Twould strength to stand afford.
It tells me of a love divine,
How Jesus’ blood was shed;
Each day this joyous song is mine
As paths of grace I tread;
Each day this joyous song is mine
As paths of grace I tread.
When stars above shall shine no more
God’s Word is still my light;
When pleasures of this world are o’er,
My joys shall reach their height;
When pleasures of this world are o’er,
My joys shall reach their height.

The Holly and the Ivy
Now both are full well grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The Holly bears the crown.
O the rising of the sun,
The running of the deer,
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the quire,
Sweet singing in the quire.
The Holly bears a blossom,
As white as lily-flower;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To be our sweet Savior.
The Holly bears a berry,
As red as any blood;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To do poor sinners good.
The Holly bears a prickle,
As sharp as any thorn;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
On Christmas Day in the morn.
The Holly bears a bark,
As bitter as any gall;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
For to redeem us all.
The Holly and the Ivy
Now both are full well grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The Holly bears the crown.

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Let the holy anthem rise,
And the choirs of heaven chant it
In the temple of the skies;
Let the mountains skip with gladness
And the joyful valleys ring,
With Hosannas in the highest
To our Savior and our King.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Like the sun from out the wave,
He has risen up in triumph
From the darkness of the grave,
He’s the splendor of the nations,
He’s the lamp of endless day;
He’s the very Lord of glory
Who is risen up today.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Blessed Jesus make us rise,
From the life of this corruption
To the life that never dies.
May Your glory be our portion,
When the days of time are past,
And the dead shall be awakened
By the trumpet’s mighty blast.

Last night I lay a sleeping,
There came a dream so fair,
I stood in old Jerusalem
Beside the temple there.
I heard the children singing,
And ever as they sang,
Methought the voice of angels
From Heav’n in answer rang;
Methought the voice of angels
From Heav’n in answer rang:—
“Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Lift up your gates and sing,
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna to your King!"
And then methought my dream was chang’d,
The streets no longer rang,
Hush’d were the glad hosannas
The little children sang.
The sun grew dark with mystery,
The morn was cold and chill,
As the shadow of a cross arose
Upon a lonely hill,
As the shadow of a cross arose
Upon a lonely hill.
“Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Hark! how the angels sing,
Hosanna in the highest,
Hosanna to your King."
And once again the scene was chang’d,
New earth there seem’d to be,
I saw the Holy City
Beside the tideless sea;
The light of God was on its streets,
The gates were open wide,
And all who would might enter,
And no one was denied.
No need of moon or stars by night,
Or sun to shine by day,
It was the new Jerusalem,
That would not pass away,
It was the new Jerusalem,
That would not pass away.
“Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Sing, for the night is o’er!
Hosanna in the highest,
Hosanna for evermore!
Hosanna in the highest,
Hosanna for evermore!.

The Holy Ghost is here,
Where saints in prayer agree,
As Jesus’ parting Gift is near
Each pleading company.
Not far away is He,
To be by prayer brought nigh,
But here in present majesty,
As in His courts on high.
He dwells within our soul,
An ever welcome Guest;
He reigns with absolute control,
As Monarch in the breast.
Obedient to Thy will,
We wait to feel Thy power;
O Lord of life, our hopes fulfill,
And bless this hallowed hour.

Holy Ghost, my Comforter,
Now from highest Heaven appear,
Shed Thy gracious radiance here.
Thou the heart’s most precious Guest,
Thou of comforters the best,
Give to us, o’erladen, rest.
Blessed Sun of grace, o’er all
Faithful hearts who on Thee call
Let Thy light and solace fall.
What without Thy aid is wrought,
Skillful deed or wisest thought,
God will count but vain and naught.
Cleanse us, Lord, from sinful stain,
On the parched spirit rain,
Heal the wounded of its pain.
Bend the stubborn will to Thine,
Melt the cold with fire divine,
Erring hearts to right incline.
Grant us, Lord, who cry to Thee,
Steadfast in the faith to be,
Give Thy gift of charity.
May we live in holiness,
And in death find happiness,
And abide with Thee in bliss!

The holy Son of God most high,
For love of Adam’s lapsed race,
Quit the sweet pleasures of the sky
To bring us to that happy place.
His robes of light He laid aside,
Which did His majesty adorn,
And the frail state of mortals tried,
In human flesh and figure born.
Whole choirs of angels loudly sing
The mystery of His sacred birth,
And the blest news to shepherds bring,
Filling their watchful souls with mirth.
The Son of God thus man became,
That men the sons of God might be,
And by their second birth regain
A likeness to His deity.

The Spirit, oh, sinner,
In mercy doth move,
Thy heart, so long hardened,
Of sin to reprove;
Resist not the Spirit,
Nor longer delay;
God’s gracious entreaties,
May end with today.
Oh, child of the kingdom,
From sin service cease:
Be filled with the Spirit,
With comfort and peace.
Oh, grieve not the Spirit,
Thy Teacher is He,
That Jesus, Thy Savior,
May glorified be.
Defiled is the temple,
Its beauty laid low,
On God’s holy altar
The embers faint glow.
By love yet rekindled,
A flame may be fanned;
Oh, quench not the Spirit,
The Lord is at hand.

O think of the home over there,
By the side of the river of light,
Where the saints, all immortal and fair,
Are robed in their garments of light.
Over there, over there,
O think of the home over there,
Over there, over there,
O think of the home over there.
O think of the friends over there,
Who before us the journey have trod,
Of the songs that they breathe on the air,
In their home in the palace of God.
Over there, over there,
O think of the friends over there,
Over there, over there,
O think of the friends over there.
My Savior is now over there,
There my kindred and friends are at rest,
Then away from my sorrow and care,
Let me fly to the land of the blest.
Over there, over there,
My Savior is now over there,
Over there, over there,
My Savior is now over there.
I’ll soon be at home over there,
For the end of my journey I see;
Many dear to my heart, over there,
Are watching and waiting for me.
Over there, over there,
I’ll soon be at home over there,
Over there, over there,
I’ll soon be at home over there.

The Homeland! O the Homeland! The land of souls free born!
No gloomy night is known there, but only fadeless morn:
I’m sighing for that country, my heart is aching here;
There is no pain in the Homeland to which I’m drawing near.
My Lord is in the Homeland, with angels bright and fair;
No sinful thing nor evil, can ever enter there;
The music of the ransomed is ringing in my ears,
And when I think of the Homeland, my eyes are wet with tears.
For loved ones in the Homeland are waiting me to come,
Where neither death nor sorrow invades their holy home:
O dear, dear native country! O rest and peace above!
Christ bring us all to the Homeland, of His eternal love.

Jesus comes, He comes in glory,
Echoes through the ages hoary
Blessed hope and thrilling story,
Hallelujah! Jesus comes!
Hope of all the ages past,
King of kings, He comes at last.
Up, ye saints of God awaking!
See the morning light is breaking!
Hallelujah! Jesus comes!
Jesus comes, the dead are waking,
Earth with mortal pangs is quaking;
Stars are falling, heavens shaking,
Hallelujah! Jesus comes!
Jesus comes, in clouds descending,
Sins restraining, sorrow ending,
Broken ties forever mending,
Hallelujah! Jesus comes!
Jesus comes, all things restoring,
Cry aloud, His grace imploring,
Bow the knee, the King adoring,
Hallelujah! Jesus comes!

A lamp in the night, a song in time of sorrow;
A great glad hope which faith can ever borrow
To gild the passing day, with the glory of the morrow,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.
Blessed hope, blessed hope,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
How the aching heart it cheers,
How it glistens through our tears,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.
A star in the sky, a beacon bright to guide us;
An anchor sure to hold when storms betide us;
A refuge for the soul, where in quiet we may hide us,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.
A call of command, like trumpet clearly sounding,
To make us bold when evil is surrounding;
To stir the sluggish heart and to keep in good abounding,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.
A word from the One to all our hearts the dearest,
A parting word to make Him aye the nearest;
Of all His precious words, the sweetest, brightest, clearest,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

Alas! how swift the moments fly!
How flash the years along!
Scarce here, yet gone already by,
The burden of a song.
See childhood, youth, and manhood pass,
And age, with furrowed brow;
Time was—Time shall be—drain the glass—
But where in Time is now?
Time is the measure but of change;
No present hour is found;
The past, the future, fill the range
Of Time’s unceasing round.
Where, then is now? In realms above,
With God’s atoning Lamb,
In regions of eternal love,
Where sits enthroned I AM.
Then pilgrim, let thy joys and tears
On Time no longer lean;
But henceforth all thy hopes and fears
From earth’s affections wean:
To God let votive accents rise;
With truth, with virtue, live;
So all the bliss that Time denies
Eternity shall give.

The hymn for conquering martyrs raise,
The victor innocents we praise,
Whom in their woe earth cast away,
But Heav’n with joy received today;
Whose angels see the Father’s face
World without end, and hymn His grace;
And while they chant unceasing lays,
The hymn for conquering martyrs raise.
A voice from Ramah was there sent,
A voice of weeping and lament,
When Rachel mourned the children’s care
Whom for the tyrant’s sword she bare.
Triumphal is their glory now,
Whom earthly torments could not bow,
What time, both far and near that went,
A voice from Ramah there was sent.
Fear not, O little flock and blest,
The lion that your life opprest!
To heavenly pastures ever new
The heavenly Shepherd leadeth you;
Who, dwelling now on Zion’s hill,
The Lamb’s dear footsteps follow still;
By tyrant there no more distrest,
Fear not, O little flock and blest.
And every tear is wiped away
By your dear Father’s hands for ay;
Death hath no power to hurt you more,
Whose own is life’s eternal store.
Who sow their seed, and sowing weep,
In everlasting joy shall reap,
What time they shine in heavenly day,
And every tear is wiped away.
O city blest o’er all the earth,
Who gloriest in the Savior’s birth,
Who are His earliest martyrs dear,
By kindred and by triumph here;
None from henceforth may call thee small,
Of rival towns thou passest all:
In whom our Monarch had His birth,
O city blest o’er all the earth!

I adore thee, I adore thee,
glorious ere the world began;
yet more wonderful thou shinest,
though divine, yet still divinest
in thy dying love for man.
I adore thee, I adore thee,
thankful at thy feet to be;
I have heard thine accent thrilling,
Lord, I came, for thou art willing
me to pardon, even me.
I adore the, I adore thee,
born of woman, yet divine;
with thy Spirit, Lord, endue me,
in thine image pure renew me,
let me evermore be thine.

Oh, how sublime is the life of the Christian,
Filled with the glory of Jesus divine;
Deep in his bosom he’s joyfully conscious
That he is born of a heavenly line.
I am a child, a child of the King,
I am a child, a child of the King;
I am a prince in the kingdom of love,
I am a child of the King.
Once I was lost and a child of confusion,
Over the mountains of folly I roamed;
But at the cross I have entered the kingdom,
Glory to Jesus! His love is enthroned.
God is my Father, and Jesus my Brother,
Since I’m adopted by heavenly love;
I am an heir in the kingdom of glory,
And have a crown that is waiting above.

I am a poor wayfaring stranger,
While traveling through this world of woe.
Yet there's no sickness, toil nor danger
In that bright world to which I go.
I'm going there to see my Father;
I'm going there no more to roam.
I'm only going over Jordan,
I'm only going over home.
I know dark clouds will gather round me;
I know my way is rough and steep.
But golden fields lie out before me
Where God's redeemed shall ever sleep.
I'm going there to see my mother,
She said she壇 meet me when I come.
I'll soon be free from every trial,
My body sleep in the churchyard;
I'll drop the cross of self denial
And enter on my great reward.
I'm going there to see my Savior,
To sing His praise forevermore.

I am a stranger here, within a foreign land;
My home is far away, upon a golden strand;
Ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea,
I’m here on business for my King.
This is the message that I bring,
A message angels fain would sing:
“Oh, be ye reconciled,"
Thus saith my Lord and King,
“Oh, be ye reconciled to God."
This is the King’s command: that all men, everywhere,
Repent and turn away from sin’s seductive snare;
That all who will obey, with Him shall reign for aye,
And that’s my business for my King.
My home is brighter far than Sharon’s rosy plain,
Eternal life and joy throughout its vast domain;
My Sovereign bids me tell how mortals there may dwell,
And that’s my business for my King.

Jesus, I am coming home today, for
I have found there’s joy in Thee alone;
From the path of sin I turn away; now
I am coming home.
Jesus, I am coming home today,
Never, never more from Thee to stray;
Lord, I now accept Thy precious promise,
I am coming home.
Many years my heart has strayed from Thee, and
Now repentant to Thy throne I come;
Jesus opened up the way for me; now
I am coming home.
O the misery my sin has caused me,
Naught but pain and sorrow I have known;
Now I seek Thy saving grace and mercy;
I am coming home.
Fully trusting in Thy precious promise,
With no righteousness to call my own,
Pleading nothing but the blood of Jesus,
I am coming home.
Now I seek the cross where Jesus died! For
All my sins His blood will still atone,
Flowing o’er till ev’ry stain is covered;
I am coming home.

I am coming to the cross;
I am poor and weak and blind;
I am counting all but dross;
I shall full salvation find.
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
Humbly at Thy cross I bow,
Save me, Jesus, save me now.
Long my heart has sighed to be
Wholly purified within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me:
“I will cleanse you from all sin." 
Here I give my all to Thee:
Friends and time and earthly store;
Soul and body Thine to be,
Wholly Thine forevermore.
In the promises I trust;
Now I feel the blood applied;
I am prostrate in the dust;
I with Christ am crucified.
Jesus comes! He fills my soul!
Perfected in Him I am;
I am every whit made whole:
Glory, glory to the Lamb!
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
Humbly at Thy cross I bow,
Jesus saves me, saves me now.

I am coming, Lord, to Thee with my broken heart;
I am coming, Lord, to Thee for rest;
Wilt Thou hear my humble plea, bid my sins depart?
Oh, release me, Savior, I'm oppressed.
I am coming, Lord, to Thee, wilt Thou hear my humble plea?
I am coming with my heart oppressed;
I am coming, I am coming,
I am coming, Lord, to Thee for rest.
I am coming, Lord, to Thee with relenting will,
I will gladly lay my burden down;
I will consecrate to Thee and Thy law fulfill,
I will bear the cross, and wear a crown.
I am coming, Lord, to Thee, and with anguish riv'n,
I am weary, worn, and tired of sin;
Lord, I press my urgent plea, may I be forgiv'n?
While I knock, O Savior, let me in.
I am coming, Lord, to Thee with an aching breast,
And I know that Thou wilt hear my cry;
I will leave the paths of sin, for my heart's distressed,
Save me, or I perish, Lord, and die.
I am coming, Lord, to Thee, for I'm sick and sore,
Do not turn from me Thy smiling face;
Lord, for mercy now I call, I will sin no more,
Wilt Thou hear and save me by Thy grace.

I am content! My Jesus liveth still,
In whom my heart is pleased.
He hath fulfilled the Law of God for me,
God's wrath He hath appeased.
Since He in death could perish never,
I also shall not die forever.
I am content! 
I am content! My Jesus is my Head;
His member I will be.
He bowed His head when on the cross He died
With cries of agony.
Now death is brought into subjection
For me, too, by His resurrection.
I am content! 
I am content! My Jesus is my Lord,
My Prince of Life and Peace;
His heart is yearning for my future bliss
And for my soul's release.
The home where He, my Master, liveth
He also to His servant giveth.
I am content! 
I am content! My Jesus is my Light,
My radiant Sun of Grace.
His cheering rays beam blessings forth for all,
Sweet comfort, hope, and peace.
This Easter sun doth bring salvation
And everlasting exultation.
I am content! 
I am content! Lord, draw me unto Thee
And wake me from the dead
That I may rise forevermore to be
With Thee, my living Head.
The fetters of my body sever,
Then shall my soul rejoice forever.
I am content! 

I am dwelling on a mountain
Where the golden sunlight gleams
In a land whose wondrous beauty
Far exceeds my fondest dreams
Is not this the land of Beulah
Blessed, blessed land of light
Where the flowers bloom forever
And the sun is always bright
I am drinking at the fountain
Where I ever would abide
For I've tasted life's pure river
And my soul is satisfied
There's no thirsting for life's treasure
Nor adorning rich and gay
For I've found a richer treasure
One that fadeth not away
For I've found a richer treasure
One that fadeth not away

You’ve buried my sins
In the depths of the sea
Carried my guilt far away
As far as the East is from the West
You removed my transgressions from me
So I’ll tell of Your mercy
Sing of Your grace
Walk in Your liberty
And I’ll live in the awesome
Light of Your love
’Cause I know that I am free!
’Cause I know that I am free!

I am free, I am unlimited,
There are no chains that bind me.
I am free, I am unlimited, Right now! Right now!
I am free, I am unlimited,
There are no chains that bind me.
I am free, I am unlimited, Right now! Right now!
We are free, we are unlimited,
There are no chains that bind us.
We are free, We are unlimited, Right now! Right now!
We are free, we are unlimited,
There are no chains that bind us.
We are free, We are unlimited, Right now! Right now!

Let worldly minds the world pursue,
It has no charms for me;
Once I admired its trifles, too,
But grace hath set me free.
Free! free! free!
I am from sin set free!
This world has now no charms for me,
For Christ hath set me free.
Its pleasures can no longer please,
Nor happiness afford;
Far from my heart be joys like these,
Now, I have seen the Lord.
As by the light of op’ning day,
The stars are all concealed;
So earthly pleasures fade away,
When Jesus is revealed.
Creatures no more divide my choice,
I bid them all depart;
His name, His love, His gracious voice,
Have fixed my roving heart.

I am glad they came with singing, I am glad, I am glad,
Came the blessed Savior bringing to his own.
I am glad the joyous throng as they moved with him along,
Raised their voices in hosannas sweet and strong.
Let us come with joy and singing.Let us come, the Savior bringing;
He is waiting to be welcomed here today.
Let him come in us to reign.And forever there remain.
Cast ing every doubt and every fear away.all away.
I am glad their hearts were singing, I am glad, I am glad,
As their grateful tho'ts were winging to the skies.
I am glad they honor gave with a loyal purpose brave
To the King who came a fallen world to save.
Let us come with joy and singing.Let us come, the Savior bringing;
He is waiting to be welcomed here today.
Let him come in us to reign.And forever there remain.
Cast ing every doubt and every fear away.all away.
I am glad his love is clinging.I am glad, I am glad,
To our happy ringing thro' the air.
I am glad we may adore.as did they who went before.
Shouting "Blessed" and "Ho- san- na sanna" o'er and o'er.
Let us come with joy and singing.Let us come, the Savior bringing;
He is waiting to be welcomed here today.
Let him come in us to reign.And forever there remain.
Cast ing every doubt and every fear away.all away.

I am going to a city
Where the roses never fade,
Here they bloom but for a season,
Soon their beauty is decayed;
Where the tree of life is blooming
And the roses never fade.
I am going to a city
Where the roses never fade,
Here they bloom but for a season,
Soon their beauty is decayed;
We'll be free from all temptations
Where the roses never fade.
I am going to a city
Where the roses never fade,
Loved ones gone to be with Jesus,
In their robes of white arrayed,
Now are waiting for my coming
Where the roses never fade.

My soul is so happy in Jesus,
For He is so precious to me;
His voice it is music to hear it,
His face it is heaven to see.
I am happy in Him,
I am happy in Him;
My soul with delight
He fills day and night,
For I am happy in Him.
He sought me so long ere I knew Him,
When wand’ring afar from the fold;
Safe home in His arms He hath brought me,
To where there are pleasures untold.
His love and His mercy surround me,
His grace like a river doth flow;
His Spirit, to guide and to comfort,
Is with me wherever I go.
They say I shall some day be like Him,
My cross and my burden lay down;
Till then I will ever be faithful,
In gathering gems for His crown.

I am happy in the service of the King.
I am happy, O so happy!
I have peace and joy that nothing else can bring,
In the service of the King.
In the service of the King
Every talent I will bring.
I have peace and joy and blessing
In the service of the King.
I am happy in the service of the King.
I am happy, O so happy!
Through the sunshine and the shadow I can sing,
In the service of the King.
I am happy in the service of the King.
I am happy, O so happy!
To His guiding hand forever I will cling,
In the service of the King.
I am happy in the service of the King.
I am happy, O so happy!
All that I possess to Him I gladly bring,
In the service of the King.

Though my faith was very weak,
Jesus said so sweet and kind,
“I will surely heal you every whit,
And will break the chains that bind." 
Then His proffered hand I took,
And the vict’ry soon was won,
I received the perfect healing touch,
And the work was quickly done.
Praise His name forevermore!
I will tell to all around,
How the precious gift of healing pow’r,
Through the Spirit we have found.

My Lord, I am here before You
Stretch out Your hands to me
My soul is completely lost
Forgive me for all my sins
I need Your salvation
My Lord, come closer to me
O my Lord, hear my prayer
Anoint my soul and my heart
I thank You, O Lord my God
Cause You have heard
My sincere cry
Guiding my steps
To the heavenly hom.

Safely hiding, should I fear,
When the Lord is near?
I am hiding, safely hiding
When the storm clouds fly,
I am hiding in His presence,
’Neath His watchful eye.
I am hiding, hiding,
I am safely hiding,
Hiding till the billows pass me by;
I am hiding, hiding,
I am safely hiding,
Hiding when the tempests sweep the sky.
Safely hiding, I am sure
All is now secure,
Though the tide should overflow me
I am not afraid,
I am trusting in His keeping
In the cleft He made.
Safely hiding in His grace,
What a resting-place!
I am in the Rock of Ages—
Should my courage fail?
There is not a dark foreboding
In the fiercest gale.
Safely hiding, I am blest
While I sweetly rest,
Oh, what peace and calm assurance
Now abide within!
I am happy in endurance
Since I’m free from sin.

The waves are tossing, billows roll,
And storm clouds screen the sunny sky;
I’ll trust the Lover of my soul,
For I am safe when He is nigh.
He’ll carry me up, up, away—
Above the clouds the sun doth shine;
In His dear arms of love I’ll lay,
For I am His and He is mine.
I cannot see the way before;
Through desert wastes or by the sea—
Whatever He may have in store,
I’ll drink the cup He giveth me.
I’ll lowly let Him have His way
To purge all dross and gold refine;
In His dear arms of love I’ll lay,
For I am His and He is mine.
Let nothing ever come to cool
My love for Him who loveth me;
Let nothing blight the bliss but fuel
The flame to burn away debris.
Let nothing turn my feet astray,
Nor strain the ties that intertwine;
In His dear arms of love I’ll lay,
For I am His and He is mine.

My heavenly Father is caring for me,
My bark He is guiding o’er life’s raging sea;
Though storms overshadow, and billows are wild,
They cannot o’erwhelm me, for I am His child.
Oh, I am His child, His own loving child,
He cares for me so tenderly, for I am His child.
And when in the furnace of trial I stand,
My Savior beside me doth hold to my hand;
“Be faithful," He whispers in accents so mild;
The flames cannot harm me, for I am His child.
When clouds thickly gather and hide from my view
The face of my Savior, His eye pierces through;
He keeps me from being by Satan beguiled;
Securely I’m resting, for I am His child.
His child evermore, and He’s with me, I know,
E’en though through the valley of death I should go;
He keepeth my spirit by sin undefiled;
He’ll take me to heaven, for I am His child.

I am Jesus’ little lamb,
Ever glad at heart I am;
For my Shepherd gently guides me,
Knows my need, and well provides me,
Loves me every day the same,
Even calls me by my name.
Day by day, at home, away,
Jesus is my Staff and Stay.
When I hunger, Jesus feeds me,
Into pleasant pastures leads me;
When I thirst, He bids me go
Where the quiet waters flow.
Who so happy as I am,
Even now the Shepherd’s lamb?
And when my short life is ended,
By His angel host attended,
He shall fold me to His breast,
There within His arms to rest.

I am never destroyed (2x)
My Jesus is living
I am never destroyed
I’ll overcome (3x)
Because Jesus is by my side
I’ll overcome (3x)
The victory is already mine
And the devil
Is burning away in anger
Come against me hot
’Cause with Jesus
I am boiling over

I am not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know that at His right hand
Is One Who is my Savior!
I take Him at His word indeed;
“Christ died for sinners"—this I read;
For in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior!
That He should leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange? So once did I,
Before I knew my Savior!
And oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me,
And with His work contented be,
As I with my dear Savior!
Yea, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this Spring;
That He Who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior.

I am not worthy, holy Lord,
That Thou shouldst come to me;
Speak but the word; one gracious word
Can set the sinner free.
I am not worthy; cold and bare
The lodging of my soul;
How canst Thou deign to enter there?
Lord, speak, and make me whole.
I am not worthy; yet, my God,
How can I say Thee nay;
Thee, Who didst give Thy flesh and blood
My ransom price to pay?
O come! in this sweet morning hour
Feed me with food divine;
And fill with all Thy love and power
This worthless heart of mine.

I am on my way to Heaven where the saints are robed in white
Shouting glory, shouting glory!
To that blessed land immortal where can never come the night,
Shouting glory all the way!
O glory, hallelujah!
I am on the way to Heaven,
Shouting glory, shouting glory
O glory, hallelujah!
I am on the way to Heaven,
Shouting glory, all the way!
I am on my way to Heaven where the streets are paved with gold,
Shouting glory, shouting glory!
To the place of many mansions and of glories yet untold,
Shouting glory all the way!
I am on my way to Heaven, blessed land of pure delight,
Shouting glory, shouting glory!
Where the blest of every nation are forever clothed in white,
Shouting glory all the way!
I am on my way to Heaven where I’ll see my Savior’s face
Shouting glory, shouting glory!
There I’ll sing redemption’s story, blessed song of saving grace,
Shouting glory all the way!

I am persuaded nothing shall separate us
from the wonderful love of God which is in Christ Jesus
I am persuaded nothing shall separate us
from the wonderful love of God which is in Christ Jesus
Life or death? Principalities?
Height or depth? No, none of these !
I am persuaded nothing shall separate us
from the wonderful love of God which is in Christ Jesus
Angels or powers? Some created thing?
The present or the future? No, none of these !!
I am persuaded nothing shall separate us
from the wonderful love of God which is in Christ Jesus
from the wonderful love of God which is in Christ Jesus

I am praying, blessed Savior,
To be more and more like Thee;
I am praying that Thy Spirit
Like a dove may rest on me.
Thou Who knowest all my weakness,
Thou Who knowest all my care,
While I plead each precious promise,
Hear, oh, hear and answer prayer.
I am praying, blessed Savior,
For a faith so clear and bright
That its eye will see Thy glory
Through the deepest, darkest night.
I am praying to be humbled
By the power of grace divine,
To be clothed upon with meekness,
And to have no will but Thine.
I am praying, blessed Savior,
And my constant prayer shall be
For a perfect consecration,
That shall make me more like Thee.

I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Savior, though earth friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me;
And, oh, that my Savior were your Savior, too.
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
I’m praying for you.
I have a Father; to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven,
But, oh, that He’d let me bring you with me, too! 
I have a robe; ’tis resplendent in whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
Oh, when I receive it all shining in brightness,
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too! 
When He has found you, tell others the story,
That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;
Then pray that your Savior may bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered—’twas answered for you! 
Speak of that Savior, that Father in heaven,
That harp, crown, and robe which are waiting for you—
That peace you possess, and that rest to be given,
Still praying that Jesus may save them with you.

I am resolved no longer to linger,
Charmed by the world’s delight,
Things that are higher, things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.
I will hasten to Him, hasten so glad and free;
Jesus, greatest, highest, I will come to Thee.
I will hasten, hasten to Him, hasten so glad and free;
Jesus, Jesus, greatest, highest, I will come to Thee.
I am resolved to go to the Savior,
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true One, He is the just One,
He hath the words of life.
I am resolved to follow the Savior,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth, do what He willeth,
He is the living Way.
I am resolved to enter the kingdom
Leaving the paths of sin;
Friends may oppose me, foes may beset me,
Still will I enter in.
I am resolved, and who will go with me?
Come, friends, without delay,
Taught by the Bible, led by the Spirit,
We’ll walk the heav’nly way.

"I Am," saith Christ, "the Way:"
Now, if we credit Him,
All other paths must lead astray,
How fair soe'er they seem.
"I am," saith Christ, "the Truth:"
Then all that lacks this test,
Proceed it from an angel's mouth,
Is but a lie at best.
"I Am," saith Christ, "the Life:"
Let this be seen by faith;
It follows, without further strife,
That all besides is death.
If what those words aver,
The Holy Ghost apply,
The simplest Christian shall not err,
Nor be deceived, nor die.

I am saved from sin, I have peace within,
And I walk with Jesus day by day;
O His hand so strong, holds me all day long,
And with Him I will not go astray.
He will hold me with His mighty hand!
He will hold me with His mighty hand!
In temptation He will help me stand!
For He will hold me with His mighty hand.
Many passed me by, heeding not my cry,
But the Savior heard and rescued me;
I was lost and blind, Jesus was so kind,
Lo, He touched my eyes and now I see.
There’s a promise sure, and it shall endure,
“Lo, I will be with thee all the way";
And though foes assail, I shall still prevail,
For I know He helps me watch and pray.
There is sweeter peace, there is perfect peace,
And my Father’s Word is wondrous dear;
There is mighty pow’r, for each trying hour,
There is love that “castteth out all fear!"

I am free from condemnation since the Lord has made me whole,
I have ceased from my repining since He filled with joy my soul;
I am ever pressing onward in the straight and narrow way,
Singing, glory, hallelujah, I am saved today.
I am saved today, I am saved today,
All my sins I have forsaken for the narrow way;
I am saved today, I am saved today,
Glory, glory, hallelujah, I am saved today.
I am living now for Jesus with a purpose to be true,
He will never, never leave me, I am sure He’ll take me through;
Though the trials may be many, and the host of hell array,
By His grace I just keep singing, I am saved today.
Jesus, keep me in Thy service, help me ever watch and wait,
Praying always in the Spirit, till I reach the pearly gate;
Use me, Lord, to Thine own glory, that some other soul can say,
By the power of the Savior, I am saved today.
There is naught can ever sever me from Christ, my Lord and King,
I am dwelling in His presence, I abide beneath His wing;
What a blessed consolation just to know that I can say
In the resurrection morning, I am saved today.

I am so glad each Christmas Eve,
The night of Jesus’ birth!
Then like the sun the Star shone forth,
And angels sang on earth.
The little Child in Bethlehem,
He was a King indeed!
For He came down from Heaven above
To help a world in need.
He dwells again in heaven’s realm,
The Son of God today;
And still He loves His little ones
And hears them when they pray.
I am so glad on Christmas Eve!
His praises then I sing;
He opens then for every child
The palace of the King.

I am so glad salvation’s free to all who will receive it,
Glad that the news was brought to me when I was lost and sad;
Praise His dear Name, I can proclaim that truly I believe it,
For I am now His child, I know, and I’m so glad.
Glory, honor be to His Name forever,
Never a greater Friend the sinful race has had;
Love Him, praise Him, Jesus, the matchless Savior,
He has redeemed this soul of mine, and I’m so glad.
I am so glad that I can tell to wayward souls the story,
Glad that by grace from day to day a helper I may be;
Finding delight in service true, my soul is winning glory,
Glory for Him Who gave His life to rescue me.
I am so glad that all my heart to Jesus I have given,
Glad that at eventide my soul true sheaves to Him may bring;
I will be true until with all the happy throng in Heaven,
Sweeter and nobler praise I give to Christ, my King.

I am so glad that our Father in Heav’n
Tells of His love in the Book He has giv’n;
Wonderful things in the Bible I see,
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me.
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.
Though I forget Him, and wander away,
Still He doth love me wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving arms I do flee,
When I remember that Jesus loves me.
Oh, if there’s only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the great King,
This shall my song through eternity be,
“Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!"
Jesus loves me, and I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down my poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!
If one should ask of me, how can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, I know very well!
God’s Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing Jesus loves me.
In this assurance I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that Jesus loves me.

That I go singing along my way;
Yes, I’m so happy to know and say,
“Jesus included me, too."
Jesus included me, yes, He included me,
When the Lord said, “Whosoever," He included me;
Jesus included me, yes, He included me,
When the Lord said, “Whosoever," He included me.
Gladly I read, “Whosoever may
Come to the fountain of life today";
But when I read it I always say,
“Jesus included me, too."
Ever God’s Spirit is saying, “Come!"
Hear the Bride saying, “No longer roam";
But I am sure while they’re calling home,
Jesus included me, too.
“Freely come drink," words the soul to thrill!
O with what joy they my heart do fill!
For when He said, “Whosoever will,"
Jesus included me, too.

I am so happy in Christ today,
My Lord, transform me
Make me just like You
I don’t want to do my own will
But Your will in me
My Lord, mould me
Your vessel I want to be
I am only clay
Without You I cannot live!
I am so small!
I depend on You
My soul is thirsty
Of Your presence in me!
I am so small!
I need Your love
All of my life
I consecrate to You!

I am standing on the Word of God,
Which came to men of old;
The Holy Book our fathers loved,
And treasured more than gold.

I am the bread of life
He who comes to me shall not hunger
He who believes in me shall not thirst
No one can come to me
Unless the father beckons
And I will raise you up
On the last day.
The bread that I will give
Is my flesh for the life of the world
And if you eat of this bread
You shall live forever
Unless you eat
Of the flesh of the Son of Man
And drink of his blood,
And drink of his blood,
You shall not have life within you.
I am the resurrection, I am the life
If you believe in me
Even though you die
You shall live forever.
Yes, lord I believe
That you are the Christ
The son of God
Who has come into the world.

Whether I live or die,
Whether I wake or sleep,
Whether upon the land,
Or on the stormy deep;
When ’tis serene and calm,
Or when the wild winds blow,
I shall not be afraid—
I am the Lord’s, I know.

I am Thine dear, blessed Jesus, all Thine,
All of self now to the death I consign;
Gladly, gladly all I have I resign,
That salvation in its fullness be mine.

I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to Thee.

I am trusting Thee, Lord, Jesus,
Trusting only Thee;
Trusting Thee for full salvation,
Great and free.

I am unworthy
Of all your kindness
Of all the blessings
Sent from above
You are so faithful
I've been ungrateful
I am unworthy
Of your pure love

I am waiting for the dawning
of the bright and blessed day,
when the darksome night of sorrow
shall have vanished far away:
when for ever with the Saviour
far beyond this vale of tears,
I shall swell the song of worship
through the everlasting years.
I am looking at the brightness -
see, it shineth from afar -
of the clear and joyous beaming
of the bright and morning Star.
Through the dark grey mist of morning
do I see its glorious light;
then away with every shadow
of this sad and weary night.
I am waiting for the coming
of the Lord who died for me;
oh, His wounds have thrilled my spirit,
'I will come again for Thee.'
I can almost hear His footfall,
on the threshold of the door,
and my heart, my heart is longing
to be with Him evermore.

I am watching for the coming of the glad millennial day,
When our blessed Lord shall come and catch His waiting bride away.
Oh! my heart is filled with rapture as I labor, watch, and pray,
For our Lord is coming back to earth again.

I am weak, but Thou art strong;
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I’ll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

You whom I took from the abyss
From the farthest place of the earth
I declared you are My servant
I’ve chosen you
Do not fear, for I will not reject you

I asked the Lord that I might grow
In faith, and love, and every grace;
Might more of His salvation know,
And seek, more earnestly, His face.

Thoughts of adoration (adoration) as Your past enters my mind
Things mankind did not deserve, You did in perfect time
I think of the sweetness of Your love (of Your love) no one has yet to 
taste
Tears stream down mine as I try to seek Your face

There are things as we travel this earth shifting sands
That transcend all the reason of man
But the things that matter the most in this world
They can never be held in our hand

I am coming to Jesus for rest,
Rest such as the purified know;
My soul is athirst to be blest,
To be washed and made whiter than snow.

I believe the Bible, it taught me how to pray,
Jesus heard and answered, took my sins away;
Gave me peace and pardon, wrote my name above,
Glory hallelujah! for His wondrous love.

I belong to Jesus;
I am not my own;
All I have and all I am,
Shall be His alone.

I belong to the King; I’m a child of His love,
I shall dwell in His palace so fair,
For He tells of its bliss in yon heaven above,
And His children in splendor shall share.

I bind unto myself today
The strong Name of the Trinity,
By invocation of the same
The Three in One and One in Three.

I bless the Christ of God, I rest on love divine,
And with unfaltering lip and heart, I call the Savior mine.
His cross dispels each doubt; I bury in His tomb
Each thought of unbelief and fear,
Each lingering shade of gloom.

I bow my forehead to the dust,
I veil mine eyes for shame,
And urge, in trembling self distrust,
A prayer without a claim.
No offering of mine own I have,
Nor works my faith to prove;
I can but give the gifts He gave,
And plead His love for love.

I bring my sins to Thee,
The sins I cannot count,
That all may cleansed be
In Thy once opened Fount;
I bring them, Savior, all to Thee;
The burden is too great for me,
The burden is too great for me.

Father of love, of justice and of mercy,
Thou art the dawn, the star at eventide;
Show Thou Thy face, and light my way to Calv’ry,
There all my sins in Thee to hide.
I bring Thee all my sins,
None can forgive but Thee.

I builded on the Rock, on the Rock of God,
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
I dug down deep and builded on the Rock,
Builded on the Rock of God.

I call the world’s Redeemer mine;
He lives Who died for me, I know;
Who bought my soul with blood divine,
Jesus, shall re-appear below,
Stand in that dreadful day unknown,
And fix on earth His heavenly throne.

I call you friend
The time we spend together goes so fast
Until the end
In Heaven we know the time will last

I came to Jesus, weary, worn, and sad.
He took my sins away, He took my sins away.
And now His love has made my heart so glad,
He took my sins away.

I can rejoice in the Lord of my life

I remember the time (I remember the time) when in darkness I wondered 
 (farther from home)
On the mountain of sin (on the mountain of sin) I had traveled so long (I 
had traveled so long)
Like the prodigal son (like the prodigal son) all my good I had squandered 
 (sadly I roamed)
But the Savior came in (but the Savior came in) and He gave me a song (twas 
a beautiful song)

I can walk! I can walk! 
Since the day that I was born I had been lame.
I can walk! I can walk! 
I've been healed by the powr' of His precious holy name.

I cannot be idle, for Jesus says, “Go
And work in My harvest today;
And then at the evening, when labor is done,
Whatever is right I will pay.

I cannot drift beyond Thy love,
Beyond Thy tender care;
Where’er I stray, still from above
Thine eye beholds me there.
I cannot drift so far away
But what Thy love divine
Upon my path, by night and day,
In mercy sweet doth shine.

I cannot tell why He Whom angels worship,
Should set His love upon the sons of men,
Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wanderers,
To bring them back, they know not how or when.
But this I know, that He was born of Mary
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,
And that He lived at Nazareth and labored,
And so the Savior, Savior of the world is come.

I cannot tell thee whence it came,
This peace within my breast;
But this I know, there fills my soul
A strange and tranquil rest.

I could pray all day, 
but it wouldn’t be enough
I could find all the right things to say, 
it wouldn’t win me anymore of Your love

Lord, I desire to be what You want me to be
To go where You want me to go, and in Your power believe
I offer unto You this prayer of deepest praise
Because I need to talk to You, these things to You I raise

I come, O Savior, to Thy table,
For weak and weary is my soul;
Thou, Bread of Life, alone art able
To satisfy and make me whole:

I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses.

Now I come, my Lord and Savior,
Humbly kneeling at Thy feet,
Sharing in Thy richest favor,
Full salvation pure and sweet.

I come to Thee, O blessed Lord,
Invited by Thy gracious Word
To this Thy feast, to sup with Thee;
Grant that a worthy guest I be.

I come with joy, a child of God,
forgiven, loved, and free,
the life of Jesus to recall,
in love laid down for me.
I come with Christians far and near
to find, as all are fed,
the new community of love
in Christ's communion bread.
As Christ breaks bread and bids us share,
each proud division ends.
The love that made us makes us one,
and strangers now are friends.
The spirit of the risen Christ,
unseen, but ever near,
is in such friendship better known:
alive and among us here.
Together met, together bound,
by all that God has done,
we'll go with joy, to give the world,
the love that makes us one.

I come with joy to meet my Lord,
forgiven, loved, and free,
in awe and wonder to recall
his life laid down for me.
I come with Christians far and near
to find, as all are fed,
the new community of love
in Christ's communion bread.
As Christ breaks bread and bids us share,
each proud division ends.
That love that made us makes us one,
and strangers now are friends.
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.
His presence, always near,
is in such friendship better known:
we see and praise him here.
Together met, together bound,
we'll go our different ways,
and as his people in the world,
we'll live and speak his praise.

"I come," the great Redeemer cries,
"To do thy will, O Lord!"
At Jordan's stream, behold!
He seals the sure prophetic word.
"Thus it becomes to fulfill
all righteousness," he said.
Then, faithful to the Lord's commands,
through Jordan's flood was led.
Hark, a glad voice! The Father speaks
from heaven's exalted height:
"This is my Son, my well-beloved
in whom I take delight."
The Savior Jesus, well-beloved!
His Name we will profess,
like him desirous to fulfill
God's will in righteousness.
No more we'll count ourselves our own
but his in bonds of love.
Oh, may such bonds for ever draw
our souls to things above!.

I could not do without Thee
O Savior of the lost,
Whose precious blood redeemed me
At such tremendous cost.
Thy righteousness, thy pardon
Thy precious blood, must be
My only hope and comfort,
My glory and my plea.

You've been readin' in the Word
And you've been talkin' to the Lord
I could tell it right away, you've been in it night and day
I could tell by what you do and what you say

I cried to God in my distress,
And by the Lord my prayer was heard;
O save me, Lord, from lying lips
And from the false, deceitful word.

I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,
And I came down from heaven and I danced on the 
earth,
At Bethlehem I had my birth.

I delight in the Lord
My soul rejoices in my God
For He has clothed my with garments
Of salvation
And arrayed me in a robe
And arrayed me in a robe
Of righteousness
Of righteousness

As I stood there looking up everything grew silent
My life flashed before my eyes
I tried to see how I even mattered
Or why I ever lived my life

I do believe the Bible, the blesséd Word of God,
And close unto its promises I cleave.
It points me to the pathway the saints and martyrs trod,
My Father is its Author, and I believe.

“I do love Jesus with all my heart"
Because of what He did for me;
His life for me on the cross He gave,
He died for me on Calvary.

I do not ask, O Lord, that life may be
A pleasant road;
I do not ask that Thou wouldst take from me
Aught of its load.

I do not ask to see the way
My feet will have to tread;
But only that my soul may feed
Upon the living Bread.
’Tis better far that I should walk
By faith close to His side;
I may not know the way I go,
But oh, I know my Guide.

I do not come because my soul
Is free from sin and pure and whole
And worthy of Thy grace;
I do not speak to Thee because
I’ve ever justly kept Thy laws
And dare to meet Thy face.

I do not know how Adam’s sin
Lives on in you and me,
Nor how it causes all the wrong
And sorrow that we see.

I do not know why oft ’round me
My hopes all shattered seem to be;
God’s perfect plan I cannot see,
But some day I’ll understand.

I don't mind my sorrow, I don't mind my tears
I don't mind my heartaches, cause my Lord is near
When I think of Calvary my troubles are behind
Cause He died to save me, I don't mind

Many times I get discouraged wond’ring what I can do
Troubles seem to pile upon me with no answer in view
Then a voice within me whispers there is one who still cares
On your knees and call on Jesus
He will answer your prayer

I dreamed that the great judgment morning
Had dawned, and the trumpet had blown;
I dreamed that the nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne;
From the throne came a bright shining angel,
And he stood on the land and the sea,
And he swore with his hand raised to Heaven,
That time was no longer to be.

All I do is ask for your forgiveness (all I do is ask for it) (you've made 
reply)
You already made reply (You already made reply) (my heart is)
Since He came my heart is filled with gladness (since He came my heart is 
filled) (I'll never)
I won't ever have to die (I won't ever have to die) (won't have to)
All I do is ask for your forgiveness (all I do is ask for it) (you've made 
reply)
You already made reply (You already made reply) (my heart is)
Since He came my heart is filled with gladness (since He came my heart is 
filled) (I'll never)
I won't ever have to die (I won't ever have to die) (won't have to)

Intro: (George starts)
Well, I feel good, good, good
Well, I feel good, oh yes my Lord
Because there's something 'bout the Spirit of
Jesus that makes me feel good, good, good, good

I feel like singing all the time,
My tears are wiped away;
For Jesus is a friend of mine,
I'll serve Him every day.

I feel the winds of God today; today my sail I lift,
Though heavy, oft with drenching spray, and torn with many a rift;
If hope but light the water’s crest, and Christ my bark will use,
I’ll seek the seas at His behest, and brave another cruise.

O what are the pleasures that silver can buy?
They come and they go, but cannot satisfy;
But praised be the Savior! I cease not to cry,
I find Thee so precious, my Savior!

I found such a wonderful Savior
In Jesus, my Lord and my King!
Undying and true His devotion;
My heart shall his glad praises sing.

My blessed Lord, I will be Thine,
Thy blood has made me free;
Thy precious word and love divine
Has won my heart to Thee.

And I worship You
I give my life to You
I fall down on my knees (2x)
As Your Spirit moves upon me now
You meet my deepest need
And I lift my hands up to Your throne
Your mercy I receive
You have broken chains that bound me
You’ve set this captive free
I will lift my voice to praise Your name
For all eternity

I ...I gotta feelin'
I gotta feelin' and I wanna feel it every day
You ...You gotta feelin'
You gotta feelin' and your gonna praise Him every day

I greet Thee, who my sure Redeemer art,
My only trust and Savior of my heart,
Who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;
I pray Thee from our hearts all cares to take.

I have a Friend and He came to seek me,
I was afar on the ocean wave,
Into the fold of His love He brought me,
Peace to my soul from that hour He gave.

I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,
He is a Savior tender and true;
Jesus, my King—how I adore Him!
And He should be as precious to you.

I have a Friend so dear,
Constant and true is He,
Filling my heart with cheer,
So good to me.
He’s covered ev’ry sin and stain,
His pow’r now makes me whole again,
And soon with Him fore’er I’ll reign—
Jesus, my Friend.

I have a Friend, so patient, kind, forbearing,
Of all my friends this Friend doth love me best;
Though I am weak and sinful, yet when sharing
His love and mercy I am ever blest.

I have a Friend so precious,
So very dear to me,
He loves me with a tender love,
He loves me faithfully;
I could not live apart from Him,
I love to feel Him nigh;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.

I have a Friend Who loveth me,
He gave His life on Calvary;
Upon the cross my sins He bore,
And I am saved forevermore.

I have a Friend Whose life is sweet to me,
I'm happy in Jesus today;
His blood doth keep me clean and make me free,
I'm happy in Jesus today.

I have a future all sublime,
Beyond the realms of space and time,
Where my Redeemer I shall see,
And sorrow nevermore shall be.

I have a home prepared for me,
A mansion bright across the sea;
And when I pass to yon bright shore,
I’ll dwell with Christ forevermore.

I have a hope, serene and sure,
That anchors past the veil;
In all the storms it holds secure,
Nor will it ever fail.

I have a Redeemer Who saves me from sin;
Now He’s abiding forever within,
His life for my ransom so freely He gave—
 ’Tis Jesus my Savior, mighty to save.

I have a rock on which I stand
I have a home in a weary land
I have a Lord who takes my hand
A song to sing with the angel band
I know the Lord will comfort me
And lead me on to victory
I am His child and He loves me
He's my rock, HE'S MY ROCK

I have a Savior, He died for me
In cruel anguish on Calv’ry’s tree.
I do not merit such love divine,
Only God’s mercy makes Jesus mine.

I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Savior though earth friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me;
And oh, that my Savior were your Savior, too.

I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, Savior King,
Since I have been redeemed.

I have decided to follow Jesus;
I have decided to follow Jesus;
I have decided to follow Jesus;
No turning back, no turning back.

I have decided to follow Jesus;
I have decided to follow Jesus;
I have decided to follow Jesus;
No turning back, no turning back.

Oh, my cup is overflowing
With the goodness of the Lord;
I am trusting in His mercy,
And rejoicing in His Word.

I have entered the valley of blessing so sweet,
And Jesus abides with me there;
And His Spirit and blood make my cleansing complete,
And His perfect love casteth out fear.

I have followed truth and justice;
Leave me not in deep distress;
Be my help and my protection,
Let the proud no more oppress.
For Thy Word and Thy salvation,
Lord, my eyes with longing fail;
Teach Thy statutes to Thy servant,
Let Thy mercy now prevail.

I have found a friend in Jesus, He’s everything to me,
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
In sorrow He’s my comfort, in trouble He’s my stay;
He tells me every care on Him to roll.

I have found a precious resting place
In the shelter of redeeming grace;
Here with joy I see my Savior’s face,
Under the atoning blood.

I have found His grace is all complete,
He supplieth ev’ry need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus’ feet,
I am free, yes, free indeed.

I'm gonna take a trip
In the good old gospel ship,
Christ the Lord has paid my fare;
I'll hear the trumpet sound
And I'll leave this sinful ground,
I'll go sailing through the air.

I have heard of a land on the far away strand,
 ’Tis a beautiful home of the soul;
Built by Jesus on high, where we never shall die,
 ’Tis a land where we never grow old.

I have heard of a land
On a far away strand,
In the Bible the story is told,
Where no cares ever come,
Neither darkness nor gloom,
And nothing shall ever grow old.

I have heard the welcome story
Of redemption, full and free;
I have wandered, O my Father,
But Thy child I long to be.

I heard heard Thy voice, Lord Jesus,
Saying in Thy grace divine:
“Fear thou not, I have redeemed thee;
I have called thee, thou art Mine."
Lord, I bring Thee full allegiance!
Therefore now to Thee I sing,
Answ’ring, “Yea, Thou hast redeemed me;
I am Thine, my Lord, my King!"

In this world I found no rest,
Sorrow filled my aching breast,
Till I turned to One who loved me best of all;
Oh, what sacred peace I find,
Since my all I have resigned!
I have left all the world to follow Jesus.

I have made my choice to follow Christ each day,
I am Thine for service, Lord;
Tho’ I sometimes falter on the thorny way,
I am Thine for service, Lord.

With all our good intentions we make plans for everyday
We forget about our Savior in the garden as He prayed
 "Take this cup of suffering from me, but it's your will I must do"
And His Father answered softly, "I have other plans for you"

I have read of a beautiful city,
Far away in the kingdom of God;
I have read how its walls are of jasper,
How its streets are all golden and broad;
In the midst of the street is life’s river,
Clear as crystal and pure to behold;
But not half of that city’s bright glory
To mortals has ever been told.

I remember when the Lord spoke to my soul,
I could feel the heavy burden from me roll
When He spoke the gracious words, “Wilt thou be whole?"
Then I settled the question forever.

I Have Sought Round This Verdant Earth For Unfading Joy
I have tried every source for mirth, but all, all will cloy;
Lord, bestow on me grace to set my spirit free;
Thine the praise shall be; mine, mine the joy.
I have wandered in mazes dark, of doubt and distress;
I have not had a kindly spark my spirit to bless;
Cheerless unbelief filled my lab'ring soul with grief;
What shall give relief? What shall give peace?
I was brought to thy gospel, Lord, from folly away;
Made to trust in thy holy word, which taught me to pray;
Here I found release, here my wearied soul found peace,
Hopes of endless bliss, eternal day.
I'm a stranger and pilgrim here in this world of woe,
But I find my Redeemer near, as onward I go;
Jesus is my friend, he'll be with me to the end,
And from foes defend my path below.
I have heard my Redeemer say, "My promise is sure;
I have taught thee to watch and pray, all hardness endure."
Jesus be my guide, in thy promise I'll confide;
Keep me near thy side, my life, my way.
I will praise thee, my heav'nly King, I'll praise and adore,
My heart's richest tribute bring to thee, God of power;
And in Heav'n above, saved by thy redeeming love,
Loud the strains shall move forever more.
Hallelujahs through heav'n will ring, salvation the theme;
Glory, honor, and praise we'll sing to God and the Lamb.
Crowns of glory wear, palms of vict'ry we shall bear;
Shouts of triumph there never shall end.

I have tried to count His blessings, and I fail to understand
Why the Lord should so richly reward;
Could I count the stars of heaven, add to them earth’s grains of 
sand,
Still His blessings are more, praise the Lord!

I have walked alone with Jesus
in a fellowship divine.
Never more can earth allure me,
I am His and He is mine.
On the mountain I have seen Him,
Christ my Comforter and Friend
And the glory of His presence
Will be with me to the end.

I had wandered off from Heaven,
On the mountains cold and gray,
When I heard my Savior calling,
To His lost sheep far away;
How I listened as the tear drops
Coursed adown like falling rain,
While His tender words of promise,
Made my spirit glad again.

I hear a voice that comes from far;
From Calvary it sounds abroad;
It soothes my soul, and calms my fear;
It speaks of pardon bought with blood.

I hear ten thousand voices singing,
Their praises to the Lord on high;
Far distant shores and hills are ringing
With anthems of their nations’ joy.
 “Praise ye the Lord! for He has given
To lands in darkness hid His light;
As morning rays light up the heaven,
His Word has chased away our night."

I hear the Savior say,
 “Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

I hear the words of love,
I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.

I hear Thy welcome voice
That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
For cleansing in Thy precious blood
That flowed on Calvary.

I heard a sound of voices,
Around the great white throne,
With harpers harping on their harps
To Him that sat thereon:
 “Salvation, glory, honor!"
I heard the song arise,
As through the courts of heaven it rolled
In wondrous harmonies.

I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I heard the voice of Jesus say, “Come unto Me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down Thy head upon My breast."
I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad;
I found in Him a resting place, and He has made me glad.

I hunger and I thirst,
Jesu, my manna be;
Ye living waters, burst
Out of the rock for me.

I know a man (I know a man), His name is Jesus
He died for you and He died for me
He gave us a chance to be free
I know a man (I know a man), He said He won't forsake me
Whether times are up or times are down
My Savior He will be

Oh, well, ah yeah
Whoo!

For God so loved this sinful world,
His Son He freely gave,
That whosoever would believe
Eternal life should have.

A long time I wandered in darkness and sin,
And wondered if ever the light would shine in;
I heard Christian friends speak of raptures divine,
And I wished—how I wished—that their Savior were mine.
I wished He were mine, yes, I wished He were mine;
I wished—how I

Oh! the love that gave my Lord to die on Calvary!
Matchless love untold, purer far than gold;
Love that offered all upon the cross to set me free,
This is the love of Christ for me.

I know I love Thee better, Lord
Than any earthly joy,
For Thou hast given me the peace
Which nothing can destroy.

I know in Whom my soul believes,
I know in Whom I trust;
The Holy One, the merciful,
The only wise and just.

I know love, love, my love, He loves me
I know love, love, my love, He loves me
I know love, love, my love, He loves me
Not for what I am but who He is
I know that love, love, my love, He loves me
I know love, love, my love, He loves me
I know love, love, my love, He loves me
Not for what I am but who He is

I know my faith is founded
On Jesus Christ, my God and Lord;
And this my faith confessing,
Unmoved I stand upon His Word.
Man’s reason cannot fathom
The truth of God profound;
Who trusts her subtle wisdom
Relies on shifting ground.
God’s Word is all sufficient,
It makes divinely sure,
And trusting in its wisdom,
My faith shall rest secure.

I know my heav'nly Father knows
The storms that would my way oppose;
But He can drive the clouds away,
And turn the darkness into day.

When I'm heavy laden (laden), when my friends are gone (all gone)
When I'm all forsaken, when I'm left to walk alone (alone)
I'll just keep on smilin', (keep on) smilin' through my tears
(Because I) For I know my Saviour is there

I know not if or dark or bright
Shall be my lot;
If that wherein my hopes delight
Be best or not.

I know not the hour when my Lord will come
To take me away to His own dear home;
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.
And that will be glory for me,
Oh, that will be glory for me!
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.

I know not what awaits me,
God kindly veils mine eyes,
And o’er each step of my onward way
He makes new scenes to rise;
And ev’ry joy He sends me, comes
A sweet and glad surprise.

I know not what the future hath
Of marvel or surprise,
Assured alone that life and death
God’s mercy underlies.

I know not when the Lord will come,
Or at what hour He may appear,
Whether at midnight or at morn,
Or at what season of the year.

I know not where the road will lead
I follow day by day,
or where it ends: I only know
I walk the King's highway.
I know not if the way is long,
and no one else can say;
but rough or smooth, up hill or down,
I walk the King's highway.
And some I love have reached the end,
but some with me may stay,
their faith and hope still guiding me:
I walk the King's highway.
The way is truth, the way is love,
for light and strength I pray,
and through the years of life, to God
I walk the King's highway.
The countless hosts lead on before,
I must not fear nor stray;
with them, the pilgrims of the faith,
I walk the King's highway.
Through light and dark the road leads on 
till dawns the endless day,
when I shall know why in this life
I walk the King's highway.

I know not why God’s wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

I know of a name, a beautiful name,
That angels brought down to earth;
They whispered it low, one night long ago,
To a maiden of lowly birth.

I know of a sleep in Jesus' name,
A rest from all toil and sorrow;
Earth folds in her arms my weary frame
And shelters it till the morrow;
My soul is at home with God in heaven,
Her sorrows are past and over.

I know of a world that is sunk in shame,
Where hearts oft faint and tire;
But I know of a Name, a precious Name,
That can set that world on fire;
Its sound is sweet, its letters flame.

I don’t understand how the world can be held
On a thread of nothing, hanging in space
I don’t have a clue where the chains can be found
That bind the stars of heaven and keep them in place
Can somebody, please, explain the awesome decree
That tells the tide what to do and holds back the sea?
I don’t know much about all of these things
But I know somebody who does

I know that my Redeemer lives,
And ever prays for me;
A token of His love He gives,
A pledge of liberty.

I know that my Redeemer lives;
What comfort this sweet sentence gives!
He lives, He lives, who once was dead;
He lives, my ever living Head.

I know that my Redeemer liveth,
And on the earth again shall stand;
I know eternal life He giveth,
That grace and power are in His hand.

I know that some day from His heavenly throne,
The blessed Redeemer of men
Will come in His glory to gather His own;
He is coming, is coming again.

My Lord
I know that You love me 

I know not the hour when my Lord will come
To take me away to His own dear home;
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.
And that will be glory for me,
Oh, that will be glory for me!
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.

He loves me, I know He loves me (I know His love)
He loves me, I know He loves me (blessed love)

I know Thy hand upholdeth me,
My Savior and my God;
And step by step I’ll follow Thee
Where’er Thy feet have trod.

I don't know about tomorrow
I just live from day to day
I don't borrow from its sunshine
For its skies may turn to gray
I don't worry o'er the future
For I know what Jesus said
And today I'll walk beside Him
For He knows what is ahead

I know not why God’s wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

I lay my sins on Jesus, the spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us from the accursed 
load;
I bring my guilt to Jesus, to wash my crimson 
stains
White in His blood most precious, till not a stain 
remains.

I leave all things to God's direction,
He loveth me in weal and woe;
His will is good, true His affection.
With tender love His heart doth glow.
My Fortress and my Rock is He:
What pleaseth God, that pleaseth me.

Oh, I left it all with Jesus, long ago
All my sins I brought Him and my woe
When by faith I saw Him bleeding on the tree;
Heard His still small whisper, “’Tis for thee!"
From my weary heart the burden rolled away;
Happy day! happy day!
From my weary heart the burden rolled away;
Happy day! happy day!

“I lift My banner," saith the Lord,
“Where Antichrist has stood;
The city of My Gospel foes
Shall be a field of blood.

I lift my 
eyes up, up to the mountains;

And I will serve no 
foreign gods
Nor any other treasure
You are my heart’s desire
Spirit without measure
Unto Your name, I will raise my sacrifice

I lift my heart to Thee,
My God and Guide most just;
Now suffer me to take no shame,
For in Thee I do trust.
Direct me in Thy truth,
And teach me, I Thee pray;
Thou art my God and Savior,
On Thee I wait alway.

I lift my heart today in praise
To Him Who loves me so,
Whose mercy crowneth all my days,
And makes my cup o’erflow.
O have I loved Him as I should
For all His blessings free?
Praise God Who giveth naught but good,
For He is good to me!

I lift my soul to God,
My trust is in His Name:
Let not my foes that seek my blood
Still triumph in my shame.

I little see, I little know,
Yet I can fear no ill;
He who hath guided me till now
Will be my leader still.

O Light of my spirit and Joy of my heart,
Thou Chief among thousands, how lovely Thou art!
I think of Thy goodness where’er I may be,
My Rock and Salvation, I live but for Thee.

I long ago left Egypt for the promised land,
I trusted in my Savior, and to His guiding hand;
He led me out to vict’ry through the great Red 
Sea,
I sang a song of triumph, and shouted, I am 
free!

I look at the cross upon Calvary,
And oh, what a wonder divine,
To think of the wealth it holds for me—
The riches of Heaven are mine.

I look to Thee in every need, and never look in 
vain;
I feel Thy strong and tender love, and all is 
well again.
The thought of Thee is mightier far than sin and 
pain and sorrow are.

Christ Jesus my Lord from Heaven came,
To save me from guilt and sin and shame;
His death on the cross of Calvary
Brought pardon and gave me liberty.

There was One came to die in the sinner’s stead,
Who the fullness of grace brought to view;
He is coming again, Judge of quick and dead,
And I love His appearing, don’t you?

I love Jesus, for He saved my soul;
From His cross the tides of mercy roll;
Long and far He sought me, when astray;
Now, He leads me in His own right way.

I love my Jesus quite alone.
The Bride, the Bridegroom of my spirit;
No others shall my heart, no, none,
Through love, through loving more inherit.
No man can do at once for two.
For one’s, for one’s will and for t’others:
Therefore I’ll leave all others.

I love the Lord, for my request
And humble plea He makes His care;
In Him through life my faith shall rest,
For He both hears and answers prayer.

I Love the Lord; He heard my voice,
And owned my humble prayer:
He makes my broken heart rejoice:
He makes my soul His care.

I love the Lord, His strength is mine;
He is my God, I trust His grace;
My Fortress high, my Shield divine,
My Savior and my Hiding Place.

I love the voice divine that speaks
The words of life and peace,
That bids the penitent rejoice,
And sin and sorrow cease.

I love the volumes of Thy Word;
What light and joy those leaves afford
To souls benighted and distressed!
Thy precepts guide my doubtful way,
Thy fear forbids my feet to stray,
Thy promise leads my heart to rest.

I love Thee, I love Thee, I love Thee, my Lord;
I love Thee, my Savior, I love Thee, my God;
I love Thee, I love Thee, and that Thou dost know;
But how much I love Thee my actions will show.

I love Thy kingdom, Lord,
The house of Thine abode,
The church our blessed Redeemer saved
With His own precious blood.

I love to hear the story which angel voices tell,
How once the King of glory came down on earth to dwell.
I am both weak and sinful; but this I surely know,
The Lord came down to save me, because He loved me so.

I love to hear the story how the Lord from Heaven came
And did not fear to visit men in all their sin and shame;
But touched the sick and made them well, the blind and they did see,
And said of little children, “Suffer them to come to Me."

I love to praise Him
I love to praise His name
I love to praise Him
I love to praise His name
I love to praise Him
I love to praise His name
I love to.I love to praise His holy name

I love to sing of Heav'n,
Where white robed angels are;
Where many a friend is gathered safe
From fear, and toil, and care.

I love to steal awhile away
From every cumbering care,
And spend the hours of closing day
In humble, grateful, prayer.

I love to tell the story of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the story, because I know ’tis true;
It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.

I love to think my Father knows
Why I have missed the path I chose,
And that I soon shall clearly see
The way He led was best for me.

I love to think of Jesus, who else could it be,
Who could come down from Heav’n to save a soul like me?
To think of Him does not repay the debt I owe,
I’ll do my best my gratitude to show.

O I love You
More than a bee loves a flower
O I love You, and this love is so strong 
O I love You, more than all 
More than life that’s within me
O I love You, and nothing steals
This endless love away from me
O I love You, ’cause You’ve taken
All my burdens for the cross
My love for You is greater than my life!
O I love You
More than a prisoner craves to see
All the light of liberty and live free
O I love You, more than a sailor
Longs for the land he left behind
O I love You, more than the exile
Loves the land that hated him
O I love You, more than a blind man
Yearns to see a ray of light
My love for You is greater than my life!

I can’t live without having
Your concern, Your presence
I need to always receive
Your love, Your perfect peace
I don’t want to be far from You
I’ve suffered so much; it was so bad
I don’t want even for a minute
To feel that You are far from me
I love You, I don’t get tired of telling You
I love You, what I did was my mistake
I love You, I will never leave You again
I confess that I was born to praise You
My heart is completely Yours
My life belongs to You
Your love for me is great, my God
Now my life is transformed
I don’t want to be far from You
I’ve suffered so much; it was so bad
I don’t want even for a minute
To feel that You are far from me

For the redeeming agony
You suffered there on Calvary,
For blood You shed and tears You cried,
I love You, Christ my crucified.

I may not go tonight to Bethlehem,
Nor follow star-directed ways, nor tread
The paths wherein the shepherds walked, that led
To Christ, and peace, and God’s good will to men.

I met Jesus at the foot of the cross
When I was bound by sin;
Jesus met me, cleansed my heart of its dross,
He gave sweet peace within.

I must have the Savior with me,
For I dare not go alone,
I must feel His presence near me,
And His arm around me thrown.

I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
There’s no other way but this;
I shall ne’er get sight of the gates of light,
If the way of the cross I miss.

I must share Jesus
To all who will listen
To all who are hungry and searching for His word, for His word
I must share Jesus
To all who are thirsting
Till His life-giving water and healing power cover the earth

I must tell Jesus all of my trials;
I cannot bear these burdens alone;
In my distress He kindly will help me;
He ever loves and cares for His own.

I need not trouble for the morrow,
For I am in my Father’s care;
He will go with me as I journey,
For all my need He will prepare.

I need Thee, precious Jesus,
For I am full of sin;
My soul is dark and guilty,
My heart is dead within.
I need the cleansing fountain
Where I can always flee,
The blood of Christ most precious,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

I need to be filled with the Spirit,
Each moment of every day,
I need to be filled in the morning,
Ere starting upon my way.

When the King in His beauty shall come to His throne,
And around Him are gathered His loved ones, His own;
There be some who will knock at His fair palace door,
To be answered within, “There is mercy no more."

For all the Lord has done for me,
I never will cease to love Him;
And for His grace so rich and free,
I never will cease to love Him.

I now have the Spirit that setteth me free,
Hallelujah!
My Savior’s own presence abideth with me,
Hallelujah!

Lord I offer my life 
to You
Everything I’ve been through
Use it for Your glory
Lord I offer my days to You
Lifting my praise to You
As a pleasing sacrifice
Lord I offer You my life
Things in the past, things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
All of my hopes, all of my plans
My heart and my hands are lifted to You

I once was a stranger to grace and to God,
I knew not my danger, and felt not my load;
Though friends spoke in rapture of Christ on the tree.

I praised the earth, in beauty seen,
with garlands gay of various green;
I praised the sea, whose ample field
shone glorious as a silver shield--
and earth and ocean seemed to say,
"Our beauties are but for a day."
I praised the sun, whose chariot rolled 
on wheels of amber and of gold;
I praised the moon, whose softer eye
gleamed sweetly through the summer sky--
and moon and sun in answer said,
"Our days of light are numbered."
O God, O good beyond compare,
if thus thy meaner works are fair,
if thus thy beauties gild the span
of ruined earth and sinful man,
how glorious must the mansion be
where thy redeemed shall dwell with thee!

I press on toward the goal
To win the prize for which God's called
Heavenward to Christ Jesus
I'm pressing on (pressing on)
I press on toward the goal
To win the prize for which God's called
Heavenward to Christ Jesus
I'm pressing on

There was a time in my life, 
I thought I’d have to do it all for myself.
I didn’t know the grace of God was sufficient,
Didn’t know the Love of God was at hand.
But now I can say, If you are discouraged,
Strugglin’ just to make it through another day,
You’ve got to let it go, let it all go,
This is what you have to say: 
I release and I let go, I let the Spirit run my life.
And my heart is open wide, 
Yes, I’m only here for God! 
No more struggle, no more strife, 
With my faith I see the light.
I am free in the Spirit, yes, I’m only here for God.

Where He may lead me I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember ’twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

I remember when my burdens rolled away;
I had carried them for years, night and day.
When I sought the blessed Lord,
And I took Him at His word,
Then at once all my burdens rolled away.

I saw a blood washed pilgrim, a sinner saved by grace,
Upon the King’s highway, with peaceful, shining face;
Temptations sore beset him, but nothing could afright;
He said, “The yoke is easy, the burden, it is light."

I saw a wayworn traveler, in tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad;
His back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone,
Yet he shouted as he journeyed, “Deliverance will come!"

I saw One hanging on a tree,
In agony and blood,
Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.

I saw one weary, sad, and torn,
With eager steps press on the way,
Who long the hallowed cross had borne,
Still looking for the promised day;
While many a line of grief and care,
Upon his brow, was furrowed there;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,
“O this!" said he—“the blessed hope."

I saw the cross of Jesus, when burdened with my sin;
I sought the cross of Jesus, to give me peace within;
I brought my soul to Jesus, He cleansed it in His blood;
And in the cross of Jesus I found my peace with God.

I Saw The Jewish Temple Purged 
While men of business, not of prayer
Fled from the place, by terror urged 
Jesus the Nazarene was there.
I saw the solemn fun'ral train,
The widowed mother's silent tear;
When lo! she clasp her son again 
The Nazarene had touched his bier.
"Hadst thou been here he had not died."
The weeping, doubting sister said,
"Lazarus, come forth!" the Savior cried;
The Nazarene restored their dead.
I saw the crowds to fury giv'n;
What could such mortal madness mean?
Why imprecate the wrath of Heav'n?
Why crucify the Nazarene?
Silent the gentle sufferer stood,
And pitying heard the frenzied cry;
"On us and ours be all his blood "
Jesus the Nazarene must die.
How devils smiled when Jesus bled!
Vain hope; they thought mankind were lost,
When bowing low His gentle head,
The Nazarene gave us the ghost.
But when amazement reigned in hell,
When Jesus, bursting from the grave,
Bade to the world this myst'ry tell;
'The Nazarene has died to save."
I saw the world consumed in flame;
The just from sin and sorrow free;
The wicked sink in endless shame 
Such was the Nazarene decree.
I heard the trumpet long and loud;
Then straight a godlike form was seen;
He rode enthroned upon a cloud 
'Twas the despised Nazarene.
1I heard the happy heav'nly throng
Praise Him who bought them with His blood;
I heard the everlasting song;
"Jesus the Nazarene is God."

I wandered so aimless
My life filled with sin.
I wouldn't let my
Dear Saviour in.
Then Jesus came like
A stranger in the night
Praise the Lord -,
I saw the light.

I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas day, on Christmas day;
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas day in the morning.

I say to all men far and near
That He is risen again;
That He is with us now and here,
And ever shall remain.

On Cal’vry’s hill of sorrow
Where sin’s demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

I see the crowd in Pilate's hall,
their furious cries I hear;
their shouts of "Crucify!" appall,
their curses fill mine ear.
And of that shouting multitude
I feel that I am one,
and in that din of voices rude
I recognize my own.
I see the scourgers rend the flesh
of God's beloved Son;
and as they smite I feel afresh
that I of them am one.
Around the Cross the throng I see
that mock the Sufferer's groan,
yet still my voice it seems to be,
as if I mocked alone.
'Twas I that shed that sacred Blood,
I nailed him to the Tree,
I crucified the Christ of God,
I joined the mockery.
Yet not the less that Blood avails
to cleanse me from sin,
and not the less that Cross prevails
to give me peace within.

I send the joys of earth away;
Away, ye tempters of the mind,
False as the smooth, deceitful sea,
And empty as the whistling wind.

I serve a risen Savior

When the pearly gates are opened
To a sinner “saved by grace,"
When thro’ everlasting mercy,
I behold my Savior’s face,
When I enter in the mansions
Of the city bright and fair,
I shall have a royal welcome,
For I’ll be no stranger there.

When the night is o’er and the shadows past,
And eternal dawn dispels the gloom of earthly care;
In the home of God I shall rest at last,
In the land of Eden I shall dwell forever there.

I shall not bear the cross thro’ yon city
When the burdens of life are laid down.
When I knock on the portals of Heaven
I will trade the old cross for a crown.

I shall not want: in deserts wild
Thou spread’st Thy table for Thy child;
While grace in streams for thirsting souls,
Thro’ earth and Heaven forever rolls.

I shall see the King
Where the angels sing;
I shall see the King some day,
In the better land,
On the golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.

In sin I once had wandered,
All weary, sad, and lone,
Till Jesus through His mercy
Adopted me His own.
E’er since I learned to trust Him,
His grace doth make me free,
And now I feel His pardon,
He’s everything to me.

I sing the birth was born tonight,
The Author both of life and light;
The angels so did sound it,
And like the ravished shepherds said,
Who saw the light, and were afraid,
Yet searched, and true they found it.

I sing the mighty power of God, that made the mountains rise,

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

You are 
beautiful beyond description,

When i think of all my faults and my failures
When i consider all the times i've let God down
I am humbled by hte grace He has extended 
I'm amazed at the mercy I have found
I could never earn His love on my own
Yet every time I come before His throne
I stand redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
I stand redeemed before the great I am
When He looks at me, I sees the nail scarred hands 
That bought my liberty
I stand redeemed
Even at my best I am unworthy
I have nothing precious i can give
A broken life is all I have to offer
And yet it's a priceless gift to Him
The bitter mark of sin will never fade away 
But i can come before Him unashamed

You became a man
As part of a loving and perfect plan, you died
The earth turned to darkness, creation cried; You lived,
You arose from the grave, and the love You give to a man like me
Is so hard to comprehend

I’ve been tested
My faith has been tried
Satan has attempted
To destroy my life
He’s robbed, abused
Accused and stolen
He’s done everything he could do
To conquer my soul
But I still have joy
I still have joy
After all I’ve been through
I still have joy (2x)
Friends have left me
They’ve questioned my faith
The good I tried to do
Was thrown back in my face
The hurt and the pain
Brought tears to my eyes
But God has replaced a blessing
For every tear I’ve cried
I still have peace
I still have peace
After all I’ve been through
I still have peace (2x)
I still have His love
I still have His love
After all I’ve been through
I still have His love (2x)

I think, when I read that sweet story of old,
When Jesus was here among men,
How He called little children as lambs to His fold,
I should like to have been with them then.

I thirst, Thou wounded Lamb of God,
To wash me in Thy cleansing blood,
To dwell within Thy wounds; then pain
Is sweet, and life or death is gain.

I thought upon the days of old,
The years departed long,
I held communion with my heart,
By night recalled my song.

I to the hills will lift my eyes;
O whence shall come my aid?
My help is from the Lord alone,
Who Heav’n and earth has made.

I Try, and Try Again
To publish Jesus' worth,
And fain I would, but never can,
Set half His riches forth.
The love His bosom feels,
His tongue alone can tell;
And till the Lord this love reveal,
None understand it well.
'Tis deep, unfathomed love,
And charms the hosts on high,
Yet will in man no wonder move,
Without an opened eye.
His blood, so freely split,
Is loud proclaim to all,
Rich balm to heal the deepest guilt,
Yet few regard the call.
Sweet health His grace imparts,
And grace divinely free;
Rich grace to cleanse the foulest heart,
Yet few say, "Give it me."
Some footsteps of thy grace
My tutored heart can find,
And view some of thy face,
And yet I'm almost blind.

Thank you Jesus for saving my soul 
Thank you Lord for inviting 
You're preparing my heavenly goal 
Hardly wait, so exciting 
Now I'm part of the family 
This is something to live for 
You're provide my liberty 
Making me want to give more

I vow to thee, my country—all earthly things above—
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love;
The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test,
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

I waited for the Lord most high,
And He inclined to hear my cry;
He took me from destruction’s pit
And from the miry clay;
Upon a rock he set my feet,
And steadfast made my way.

I waited for the Lord my God,
Yea, patiently drew near,
And He at length inclined to me,
My pleading cry to hear.

I walk in danger all the way.
The thought shall never leave me
That Satan, who has marked his prey,
Is plotting to deceive me.
This foe with hidden snares
May seize me unawares
If e'er I fail to watch and pray.
I walk in danger all the way.

I know not where the road will lead
I follow day by day,
Or where it ends: I only know
I walk the King’s highway.

I walk with Love along the way,
And O, it is a holy day;
No more I suffer cruel fear,
I feel God’s presence with me here;
The joy that none can take away
Is mine; I walk with Love today.

In sorrow I wandered, my spirit oppressed,
But now I am happy—securely I rest;
From morning till evening glad carols I sing,
And this is the reason—I walk with the King.

I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.

I wandered sore distressed,
All weary and forlorn;
I had no place to rest,
Of all my pleasures shorn—
My thirsting spirit sighed,
And in the desert cried.

I'm gonna know more than I know now (more than I know now)

I wanna know why (I wanna know why), oh why (Oh Lord), I always seem to 
fall
Why (I wanna know why), oh why (Oh Lord), I can't find my way
Tell my why (I wanna know why), oh Lord, You sent Your Son to die
He washed my sins away at Calvary

I wanna love You regardless if anyone else does
I wanna serve You even if I'm all alone
Though others forsake You I wanna give you my faith and trust
Faithfully follow everywhere You go

I want a faith
I want a faith that moves mountains and Satan can not shake (faith that 
mountains can not shake)
When I'm tempted or tested, my love he'll never take (he can never take)
I want a prayer that is answered by heaven in its turn (prayer answered in 
its turn)
To receive words from Christians, whose laws are His concern

I want a principle within of watchful, godly fear,
A sensibility of sin, a pain to feel it near.
I want the first approach to feel of pride or wrong desire,
To catch the wandering of my will, and quench the kindling fire.

I want Jesus to walk with me
I want Jesus to walk with me:
All along life's pilgrim journey
I want Jesus to walk with me

I want the Spir't of power within,
Of love, and of a healthful mind:
Of power, to conquer inbred sin;
Of love, to thee and all mankind;
Of health, that pain and death defies,
Most vigorous when the body dies.
When shall I hear the inward voice
Which only faithful souls can hear?
Pardon, and peace, and heavenly joys
Attend the promised Comforter:
O come, and righteousness divine,
And Christ, and all with Christ, are mine!
O that the Comforter would come,
Nor visit as a transient guest,
But fix in me his constant home,
And take possession of my breast,
And fix in me his loved abode,
The temple of indwelling God!
Come, Holy Ghost, my heart inspire,
Attest that I am born again!
Come, and baptise me now with fire,
Nor let thy former gifts be vain;
I cannot rest in sins forgiven -
Where is the earnest of my heaven?
Where the indubitable seal
That ascertains the kingdom mine,
The powerful stamp I long to feel,
The signature of love divine?
O shed it in my heart abroad -
Fullness of love, of heaven, of God!

I want to be a worker for the Lord,
I want to love and trust His holy Word,
I want to sing and pray,
Be busy every day
In the vineyard of the Lord.

I want to be faithful 
to You
I want to be true, Lord
Whatever You say I will do
I will obey

He climbs in my lap for a goodnight hug
He calls me dad and I call him bug
Faded old pillow and a bear named pooh
He snuggles up close and says, "I wanna be like you"

Nobody else but Jesus
Nobody else will do

I have one deep, supreme desire,
that I may be like Jesus.
To this I fervently aspire,
that I may be like Jesus.
I want my heart His throne to be,
so that a watching world may see
His likeness shining forth in me.
I want to be like Jesus.
He spent His life in doing good;
I want to be like Jesus.
In lowly paths of service trod;
I want to be like Jesus.
He sympathised with hearts distressed,
He spoke the words that cheered and blessed,
He welcomed sinners to His breast.
I want to be like Jesus.
A holy, harmless life He led;
I want to be like Jesus.
The Father’s will, His drink and bread;
I want to be like Jesus.
And when at last He comes to die,
 “Forgive them, Father," hear Him cry
for those who taunt and crucify.
I want to be like Jesus.
O perfect life of Christ, my Lord!
I want to be like Jesus.
My recompense and my reward,
that I may be like Jesus.
His Spirit fill my hungering soul,
His power all my life control.
My deepest prayer, my highest goal,
that I may be like Jesus.

I want to be where You 
are
Dwelling in Your presence
Feasting at Your table
Surrounded by Your glory
In Your presence
That’s where I always want to be
I just want to be
I just want to be with You
I just want to be where You are
To enter boldly in Your presence
I don’t want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are
O my God, You are my strength and my song!
And when I’m in Your presence
Though I’m weak You are always strong

While travelling through this world of sorrow
I'm on my way to gloryland
I'll not turn back for some tomorrow
My trials here I'll understand

I want to praise Him, I want to praise Him
Praising the name of the one proclaimed His love
I will rejoice in Him, I will rejoice in Him

I was a wandering sheep,
I did not love the fold;
I did not love my Shepherd’s voice,
I would not be controlled.
I was a wayward child,
I did not love my home;
I did not love my Father’s voice,
I loved afar to roam.

I was lost in sin when Jesus found me,
But He rescued me, all glory to His Name!
And the cords of worldly pleasure bound me,
Till He saved me from sin and shame.

I was made a Christian
When my name was giv’n,
One of God’s dear children,
And an heir of heaven.
In the name of Christian
I will glory now,
Evermore remember
My baptismal vow.

I was made to praise You
I was made to glorify Your name
In every circumstance 
To find a chance to thank You 
I was made to love You
I was made to worship at Your feet
And to obey You Lord
I was made for You 
I will always praise You
I will always glorify Your name 
In every circumstance 
I’ll find a chance to thank You
I will always love You
I will always worship at Your feet
And I’ll obey You Lord 
I was made for You (2x)

I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord:
This was freely given, and I found
That He always kept His word.

I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more,
But the Master of the sea, heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me, now safe am I.

You ask me how I know that Jesus saves me,
How I know that all my sins are white as snow;
You ask me how I know that He forgave me;
Now listen, I must tell you how I know.

I was wandering and weary
When my Savior came unto me;
For the ways of sin grew dreary,
And the world has ceased to woo me;
And I thought I heard Him say,
As He came along His way,

I will be here, I will be here
I will be here, I will be here

I will 
call upon the Lord, (I will call upon the Lord,)

I will 
change your name.

That He is Mighty you 
can not touch His fire
He will devour the evil in your land
He will exalt you with His wondrous hand
For all the world to see
I will climb up Mount Sinai
And I will receive God's holy sign
To make my whole life shine His light
For all the world to see

I will early seek the Savior,
I will learn of Him each day;
I will follow in His footsteps,
I will walk the narrow way.

I will ever sing Thy praises,
Mighty God and gracious King;
Loud my heart its tribute raises,
And to Thee my psalms I sing;
Thou art King of all creation,
Every land and every nation;
 “Thousand, thousand thanks to Thee,
Mighty God," my song shall be!

I will extol Thee, O my God, and praise Thee, O my King;
Yea, every day and evermore Thy praises will I sing.
Great is the Lord, our mighty God, and greatly to be praised;
His greatness is unsearchable, above all glory raised.

I will follow him,
Follow him where ever he may go
And near him I always will be,
For nothing can keep me away;
He is my destiny.
I will follow him.
Ever since he touched my heart I knew
There isn't an ocean too deep,
A mountain so high it can keep,
Keep me away,
Away from his love

I will go in the strength of the Lord,
In the path He hath marked for my feet:
I will follow the light of His Word,
Nor shrink from the dangers I meet.
His presence my steps shall attend:
His fullness my wants shall supply;
On Him, till my journey shall end,
My hope shall securely rely.

I will lift up my eyes to the mountains
From whence shall my help come
My help comes from the Lord
Who made heaven and earth
He will not allow your foot to slip
    He who keeps you will not slumber
    Behold, He who keeps Israel
    Will neither slumber nor sleep ()
The Lord is your keeper
    The Lord is your shade on your right hand
    The sun will not smite you by day
    Nor the moon by night ()
The Lord will protect you from all evil
    He will keep your soul, the Lord will guard
    Your going out and your coming in
    From this time forth and forever ()

I will make the darkness light before thee,
What is wrong I'll make it right before thee,
All thy battles I will fight before thee,
And the high place I'll bring down.

I will meet you in the morning,
Just inside the Eastern Gate.
Then be ready, faithful pilgrim,
Lest with you it be too late.

Once I wandered in darkness unsaved,
Till the Savior came knocking at my heart,
And I opened the door, let Him in,
Now rich blessings to me He imparts.

I will not be afraid, I will not be afraid;
I will look upward, and travel onward,
And not be afraid.

Sweet is the promise “I will not forget thee,"
Nothing can molest or turn my soul away;
E’en though the night be dark within the valley,
Just beyond is shining an eternal day.

When God of old the way of life
Would teach to all His own,
He placed them safe beyond the reach
Of death, by Blood alone.

When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing,
When He said, “Wilt thou be clean?"

Praise the Lord, sing praise to the Lord
Praise the Lord, sing praise to the Lord
Praise the Lord, sing praise to the Lord

He'll make us broken bread and poured out wine
Just to feed the needs of them
If we bow on bended knee before the Lord (oh Lord)

I will rise up and call you blessed
I will stand up and sing your praise
I will kneel down before your altar
I will bow down before your throne

Oh what love have I found in my Savior
He's my Lord and the master of all (master of all)
I will love Him throughout all the ages
 'Cause I've served Him and answered His call
And since I've whipped old Satan (escaped the roar), espcaped the lion's 
roar
I'll be at home with Jesus (with Him) to sing forevermore

I will sing my Maker’s praises and in Him most joyful be,
For in all things I see traces of His tender love to me.
Nothing else than love could move Him with such sweet and tender 
care
Evermore to raise and bear all who try to serve and love Him.
All things else have but their day, God’s great love abides for 
aye.

I will sing of Jesus’ love,
Sing of Him Who first loved me;
For He left bright worlds above,
And died on Calvary.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ Who died for me.
How He left His home in glory
For the cross of Calvary.

I will sing you a song of that beautiful land,
The far away home of the soul,
Where no storms ever beat on the glittering strand,
While the years of eternity roll,
While the years of eternity roll;
Where no storms ever beat on the glittering strand,
While the years of eternity roll.

I will speak Your name when the storm is raging
I will speak Your name when the sea is calm
I will speak Your name when my fears o'ertake me
And forever on my lips I will speak Your name

When times of temptation bring sadness and gloom,
I will tell it to Jesus my Lord;
The last of earth’s treasures borne out to the tomb,
I will tell it to Jesus my Lord.
This earth hath no sorrow
For today or tomorrow,
But Jesus hath known it and felt long ago,
And when it comes o’er me,
And I’m tempted so sorely,
I will tell it to Jesus my Lord.

I shall not bear the cross thro’ yon city
When the burdens of life are laid down.
When I knock on the portals of Heaven
I will trade the old cross for a crown.

I with Thee would begin, O my Savior so dear,
On the way that I still must pursue;
I with Thee would begin every day granted here,
As my earnest resolve I renew
To be and remain Thine forever.

I wonder as I wander
out under the sky,
how Jesus the Saviour
did come for to die
for poor ord'n'ry people
like you and like I.
I wonder as I wander
out under the sky.
When Mary birthed Jesus,
'twas in a cow's stall
with wise men and farmers
and shepherds and all.
But high from God's heaven
a star's light did fall,
and the promise of ages
it did then recall.
If Jesus had wanted
for any wee thing,
a star in the sky,
or a bird on the wing,
or all of God's angels
in heav'n for to sing,
he surely could have it,
'cause he was the King.

I worship Thee, most gracious God,
And all Thy ways adore;
And every day I live, I seem
To love Thee more and more.

I worship Thee, O Holy Ghost,
I love to worship Thee;
My risen Lord for aye were lost
But for Thy company.

I worship thee, sweet will of God,
And all thy ways adore;
And every day I live, I long
To love thee more and more.

I worship thee, Lord Jesus,
as children did of old,
who sang within thy temple
hosannas manifold.
I worship thee, Lord Jesus,
who, on thine altar laid,
in this most awful service,
our food and drink art made.
I worship thee, Lord Jesus, 
who in thy love divine,
art hiding here thy Godhead
in forms of bread and wine.
I worship thee, Lord Jesus,
and kneeling unto thee,
as thou didst come to Mary,
I pray thee come to me.
I worship thee, Lord Jesus,
my King and Savior mild:
thou hast blessed other children;
bless also me, thy child.

Earthly pleasures vainly call me;
I would be like Jesus;
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;
I would be like Jesus.

I would be true, for there are those who trust me;
I would be pure, for there are those who care;
I would be strong, for there is much to suffer;
I would be brave, for there is much to dare;
I would be brave, for there is much to dare.

I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;
Teach me how, teach me how;
I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;
Help me, help me now.

I would, but cannot sing,
Guilt has untuned my voice;
The serpent sin’s envenomed sting
Has poisoned all my joys.

I would, but cannot sing,
Guilt has untuned my voice;
The serpent sin’s envenomed sting
Has poisoned all my joys.

I would draw nearer to Jesus,
In His sweet presence abide,
Constantly trying to serve Him,
Safe and secure at His side.

When pangs of death seized on my soul,
Unto the Lord I cried;
Till Jesus came and made me whole,
I would not be denied.

I would not live alway; I ask not to stay
Where storm after storm rises dark o’er the way;
The few lurid mornings that dawn on us here
Are enough for life’s woes, full enough for its cheer.

I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I’d rather be His than have riches untold;
I’d rather have Jesus than houses or lands;
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced han.

There are people who would rather live 
in splendor
And brag about their silver and their gold,
And people who would trade God's promise
For its glory to hold;
There are people who would rather live in mansions,
There are people who would rather live abroad,
But I'd rather have a little log cabin
By the side of the road.

If any man now will hear the voice
Of Christ, and say,
“Dear Savior, come in and dwell with me,
Come in, I pray."

If asked whereon I rest my claim
To full salvation’s joy,
If nothing more I need to name,
Or other words employ,
Besides our Savior’s blood and wounds,
To me all-satisfying grounds;
I answer then, “My claim is good!
’Tis based on Jesus’ blood."

If Christ is mine, then all is mine,
And more than angels know;
Both present things and things to come,
And grace and glory, too.

If our Lord should come tonight,
With the bright angelic host,
Would He find us in His vineyard,
Every servant at his post?
Thro’ the precious cleansing blood,
Are our garments clean and white?
Are we dwelling in the light,
Should our Lord appear tonight?

If death my friend and me divide,
Thou dost not, Lord, my sorrow chide,
Or frown my tears to see;
Restrained from passionate excess,
Thou bidst me mourn in calm distress
For them that rest in Thee.

If ever it could come to pass, 
That sheep of Christ might fall away,
My fickle, feeble soul, alas ! 
Would fall a thousand times a day; 
Were not thy love as firm as free, 
Thou soon wouldst take it, Lord, from me.
I on thy promises depend; 
At least I to depend desire; 
That thou wilt love me to the end, 
Be with me in temptation's fire; 
Wilt for me work, and in me too, 
And guide me right and bring me through.
No other stay have I beside; 
If these can alter, I must fall; 
I look to thee to be supplied 
With life, with will, with power, with all.
Rich souls may glory in their store, 
But Jesus will relieve the poor.

If God had not been on our side
And had not come to aid us,
The foes with all their power and pride
Would surely have dismayed us;
For we, His flock, would have to fear
The threat of men both far and near
Who rise in might against us.

If God Himself be for me, I may a host defy,
For when I pray, before me my foes confounded fly.
If Christ, the Head, befriend me, if God be my support,
The mischief they intend me shall quickly come to naught.

If God is Mine, Then Present Things
And things to come are mine;
Yea, Christ, His Word, and Spirit too,
And glory all divine.
If he is mine, then from His love
He ev'ry trouble sends;
All things are working for my good,
And bliss his rod attends.
If he is mine, I need not fear
The rage of earth and hell;
He will support my trembling hope,
Their utmost force repel.
4.If he is mine, let friends forsake,
Let wealth and honor flee 
Sure he who giveth me Himself,
Is more than wealth to me.
If he is mine, I'll boldly pass
Through death's tremendous vale;
He is a solid comfort when
All others comforts fail.
O, tell me, Lord! that thou are mine;
What can I wish beside?
My soul would at the fountain live,
When all the streams are dried.

If human kindness meets return,
And owns the grateful tie;
If tender thoughts within us burn
To feel a friend is nigh;
O shall not warmer accents tell
The gratitude we owe
To Him Who died, our fears to quell,
Our more than orphan’s woe!

If asked whereon I rest my claim
To full salvation’s joy,
If nothing more I need to name,
Or other words employ,
Besides our Savior’s blood and wounds,
To me all-satisfying grounds;
I answer then, “My claim is good!
’Tis based on Jesus’ blood."

If I come to Jesus,
He will make me glad;
He will give me pleasure
When my heart is sad.

How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream,
When memory recalls them now and then!
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat,
If I could hear my mother pray again.

If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Were my life worth living for a day?
Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
In the things that soon must pass away?
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?
Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
For a moment with a Christ-filled life?

If I have wounded any soul today,
If I have caused one foot to go astray,
If I have walked in my own willful way,
Dear Lord, forgive!

If I walk in the pathway of duty,
If I work till the close of the day;
I shall see the great King in His beauty,
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

It may be in the valley, where countless dangers hide;
It may be in the sunshine that I, in peace, abide;
But this one thing I know—if it be dark or fair,
If Jesus is with me, I’ll go anywhere.

If Jesus leads this army,
We will outshine the sun,
We will outshine the sun,
We will outshine the sun;
If Jesus leads this army,
We will outshine the sun,
And we'll walk the golden streets on high.

If, on a quiet sea, toward Heaven we calmly sail,
With grateful hearts, O God, to Thee,
We’ll own the favoring gale,
With grateful hearts, O God, to Thee,
We’ll own the favoring gale.

If our Lord should come tonight,
With the bright angelic host,
Would He find us in His vineyard,
Every servant at his post?
Thro’ the precious cleansing blood,
Are our garments clean and white?
Are we dwelling in the light,
Should our Lord appear tonight?

If pathless forests meet my view,
I will not doubt or fear;
What has been done that I can do,
My way shall be made clear.

If the dark shadows gather as you go along,
Do not grieve for their coming; sing a cheery 
song.
There is joy for the taking; it will soon be 
light.
Ev’ry cloud wears a rainbow if your heart keeps 
right.

When the sun of your life has gone down,
And the clouds in the west turn to gold,
Endless death will to you then have come,
If the light has gone out in your soul.

If the world from you withhold of its silver and 
its gold,
And you have to get along with meager fare,
Just remember, in His Word, how He feeds the 
little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.

If there be that skills to reckon
All the number of the blest,
He perchance can weigh the gladness
Of the everlasting rest,
Which, their earthly exile finished,
They by merit have possessed.

If there were no God there would be no music
There would be no dream to be dreaming of
What a dreadful thought of an empty future
If there were no God there would be no love

If there were no You
If there were no Yoh

If thou but suffer God to guide thee
and hope in him through all thy ways,
he'll give thee strength, whate'er betide thee,
and bear thee through the evil days.
who trusts in God's unchanging love
builds on the rock that naught can move.

O lost one in the wilds of sin,
So long from God away;
Before thee lies an open path,
Where thou canst walk today.

If Thy beloved Son, O God,
Had not to earth descended
And in our mortal flesh and blood
Had not sin's power ended,
Then this poor, wretched soul of mine
In hell eternally would pine
Because of its transgression.

If to Christ our only King
Men redeemed we strive to bring,
Just one way this may be done—
We must win them one by one.

In God’s Word it is recorded
That this world will not endure;
Then while time is yet afforded
Make your hope of Heaven sure;
For the stars, before the morning,
From their orbits may be hurled,
And the moon may send a warning
That tonight will end the world.

If we brightly shine, if we sweetly smile,
We will help to shorten each long mile;
If we speak the words of love and cheer
Happy days will make a happy year.

If we have forgotten the Name of our God,
Or unto an idol our hands spread abroad,
Shall not the Almighty uncover this sin?
He knows all our hearts and the secrets within.

Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
 'Til we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore

If you are tired of the load of your sin,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you desire a new life to begin,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

If you ask it will be given to you
Seek, you will find
Knock on my door, it will open for you
I am here, you need to try
I'm the God of Utmost High

I wouldn't know what to say, I wouldn't know what to do, If you came back from Heaven, And I could look at you.Would I fumble for the words? Would I be a little shy? Would I bust right out with laughter? Or break right down and cry?  Oh, if you came back from Heaven, Would it be like it was then? Could we just pick up, where we left off, And try it all again? Oh, if you came back from Heaven, It would freeze me in my tracks.And I hope God knows, if he let you go, I'd never send you back.Do your kisses feel the same? Do you still have the same touch? And will you whisper softly, 'Cos you've missed me so much? Have you heard all my prayers, When I lay down at night? And did you feel my body, When I held your pillow tight?  Oh, if you came back from Heaven, Would it be like it was then? Could we just pick up, where we left off, And try it all again? Oh, if you came back from Heaven, It would freeze me in my tracks.And I hope God knows, if he let you go, I'd never send you back.And if, God forbid, You leave this Earth again while I see.I hope he knows, if you go, You'll be bringing me.Oh, if you came back from Heaven, Would it be like it was then? Could we just pick up, where we left off, And try it all again?Oh, if you came back from Heaven, It would freeze me in my tracks.And I hope God knows, if he let you go, I'd never send you back.I hope God knows, if he let you go, I'd never send you back.

If you cannot, on the ocean, sail among the swiftest fleet,
Rocking on the highest billows, laughing at the storms you meet,
You can stand among the sailors, anchored yet within the bay,
You can lend a hand to help them, as they launch their boats away.

If you miss me from-a (x10)
If you miss me down here

You may know this day that your sins are gone,
If you’ll come to Christ and forsake the wrong,
If you will repent, from the heart forgive;
Do obey, believe Him, sinner, look and live.

If you will only let God guide you,
And hope in Him through all your ways,
Whatever comes, He’ll stand beside you,
To bear you through the evil days;
Who trusts in God’s unchanging love
Builds on the Rock that cannot move.

If you would be a pillar in the church of God,
You must overcome the world,
You must overcome the world;
Die to fame and reputation, take the path that Jesus trod,
If you would be a pillar in the church of God.

If you would come after Me, to your self say no;
Take your cross up daily; follow Me alone.
If you try to save your life, you will not succeed.
You must lose your self for Me; then you'll find life indeed.
What good will it be for you to gain the world as a whole,
If the end result is losing your own soul?

If the dark shadows gather as you go along,
Do not grieve for their coming; sing a cheery song.
There is joy for the taking; it will soon be light.
Ev’ry cloud wears a rainbow if your heart keeps right.

If you're on your way to heaven clap your hands,
If your sins have been forgiven, clap your hands
Point to Heaven in the sky,
Then shake hands with one nearby,
If the Lord can satisfy
Clap your hands, clap your hands
If you're on your way to heaven clap your hands,
If you're not ashamed of Jesus, raise your hand.
If you've taken you stand for Jesus take your stand.
Now sit down and rest a while
Turn to someone with a smile
If your happy all the while
Clap your hands, clap your hands
If you're on your way to heaven clap your hands,

Spoken)
This is a song about perceptions, paradigms, and politics
Borne out of the prejudices that plague us as a people
Get the point?
Then lets proceed.

Well I'm happy today
I'm servin' Jesus all the way
Never have I felt so secure
And when Jesus is my friend
He will help me through the end
No doubting, yes I'll always be sure

Jesus wants me for a sunbeam,
To shine for Him each day;
In every way try to please Him,
At home, at school, at play.


Oh when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair (bright and fair)
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there (roll is called up yonder 

I longed to be a child of God,
And do my Savior’s will;
And yet the sin that most I feared,
I knew unconquered still.
 “Dear Lord," I said, for as I knelt
I saw Him on the tree—
 “This heavy burden on my heart,
I’ll gladly bear for Thee."

I’ll bless the Lord from day to day;
How good are all His ways!
Ye humble souls that use to pray,
Come, help my lips to praise.

I lift my heart today in praise
To Him Who loves me so,
Whose mercy crowneth all my days,
And makes my cup o’erflow.
O have I loved Him as I should
For all His blessings free?
Praise God Who giveth naught but good,
For He is good to me!

It may not be on the mountain’s height, or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle’s front my Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls to paths I do not know,
I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Yours,
I’ll go where You want me to go.

On the resurrection morning
When all the dead in Christ shall rise
I'll have a new body
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life

On the resurrection morning, when all the dead in Christ shall rise
I'll have a new body
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life (eternal)
Sewed in weakness, raised in power, ready to live in Paradise
I'll have a new body
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life, oh yes

My life, my love I give to Thee,
Thou Lamb of God Who died for me;
O may I ever faithful be,
My Savior and my God!

I'd like to stay here longer then mans allowed in days
And watch the fleeting changes of life's eneven ways
And if my Savior calls me to that sweet home on high
I'll live with Him forever in glory by and by

I'd like to stay here longer then man's alotted days
And watch the fleeting changes of life's uneven ways
But if my Savior calls me to that sweet home on high
I'll live with Him forever in glory by and by

探is a sweet and glorious tho't that comes to me,
I'll live on, yes, I'll live on;
Jesus saved my soul from death, and now I'm free,
I'll live on, yes, I'll live on.

Oh, Jesus (Jesus I'll never forget)
What you've done for me (what you've done for me)
Jesus I'll never forget (Jesus I'll never forget)
You set my soul so free (set my soul so free)
Jesus I'll never forget (Jesus I'll never forget)
How you brought me out (how you brought me out)
Well a no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll never forget

I’ll not give up the Bible,
That precious book divine,
For glory gilds its pages,
And truth adorns each line.

This world is one great battlefield
With forces all arrayed,
If in my heart I do not yield
I'll overcome some day.
I'll overcome some day,
I'll overcome some day,
If in my heart I do not yield,
I'll overcome some day.

I’ll praise my Maker while I’ve breath,
And when my voice is lost in death,
Praise shall employ my nobler powers;
My days of praise shall ne’er be past,
While life, and thought, and being last,
Or immortality endures.

I’ll see the new Jerusalem when Christ to earth does come.
I’ll see Him then, will hear His voice, all Christians will rejoice.
Of sun and moon there is no sign, God’s light o’er all will shine.
And then, when He has come with might, it never will be night.

I’ll speak the honors of my King,
His form divinely fair;
None of His sons of mortal race
May with the Lord compare.

Fierce and wild the storm is raging
Round a helpless bark,
On to doom ’tis swiftly driving,
O’er the waters dark!

I’ll tell the world, that I’m a christian

I’m a pilgrim and a stranger,
Rough and thorny is the road,
Often in the midst of danger,
But it leads to God.
Clouds of darkness oft distress me;
Great and many are my foes;
Anxious cares and thoughts oppress me;
But my Father knows.

I’m a pilgrim and a stranger,
Rough and thorny is the road,
Often in the midst of danger,
But it leads to God.
Clouds of darkness oft distress me;
Great and many are my foes;
Anxious cares and thoughts oppress me;
But my Father knows.

As I stood inside the courtroom
The judge came walking in
There was One who stood beside me
A compassionate friend
As he spoke my situation
I knew that he was in control
Of the destiny of my eternal soul

I have started for a city on that bright eternal shore
Where the saints of God shall gather and live on forevermore
Tis a land of love and purity where my possessions lie

I'm but a stranger here, Heav'n is my home;
Earth is a desert drear, Heav'n is my home.
Danger and sorrow stand round me on every hand;
Heav'n is my fatherland, Heav'n is my home.

I'm free (I'm free), I'm free (I'm free)
I'm free in Jesus' name
I'm free (I'm free), I'm free (I'm free)
To live and to proclaim

Satan led my soul astray (Satan led my soul astray I drifted)
From the straight and narrow way (that leads to happiness and life 
eternal)
But to Jesus I did pray (to the Lord I humbly prayed)

There are people almost everywhere
Whose hearts are all aflame
With the fire that fell at Pentecost,
Which made them all acclaim;
It is burning now within my heart—
All glory to His Name!—
And I’m glad that I can say I’m one of them.

My heav'nly home is bright and fair,
Nor pain nor death can enter there;
Its glitt池ing towers the sun outshine,
That heav'nly mansion shall be mine.

There is a land of wondrous beauty,
Where the “Living Waters" flow,
The Word of God to all has said it,
And it surely must be so.

Lord, I have started to walk in the light
That shines on my pathway so clearly, so bright;
I’ve bade the world and its follies adieu,
And now with my Savior I mean to go through.

I'm gonna sing about Jesus (I will sing about Jesus)
Yes, I'm gonna sing it for you (I'm gonna sing it for you)
I'm gonna sing about Jesus (I will sing about Jesus)
I'm gonna tell you the message so true (tell the message so true)
So won't you sit right there while I tell you the Word
Yes I'll tell you the best thing that you ever heard
So let me sing about Jesus (sure want to sing)
 'Cause I sure want to sing it for you

I have a Friend Whose life is sweet to me,
I'm happy in Jesus today;
His blood doth keep me clean and make me free,
I'm happy in Jesus today.

I'm here to lift my voice and to praise His holy name
You're here to lift your hands and to shout (shout), "Thank you, Lord!"
We're here to lift our hearts and rejoice in God's saving grace
He's here to fill our souls and receive our humble praise

Hallelujah, I'm in His love
Hallelujah, I'm in His love (Hallelujah)

Dear Lord of Calvary, again I come to Thee
And seek Thy precious hand to guide
The way I'll never find without Thy love divine
And in Thy shelter I would hide
So Lord, I daily pray to lead me all the way
And let Thy presence linger ever near
I'm in a foreign land, nobody understands

I’m marching on to the Holy Land
I’m marching on to the Holy Land
I’m marching on to the Holy Land
Praise the Lord,
I’m marching on to the Holy Land
Abraham is there, I’ll be there too 
Abraham is there, I’ll be there too
Abraham is there, I’ll be there too
Praise the Lord
I’m marching on to the Holy Land
(Moses .Elijah .)
If you don’t go, don’t stop me
If you don’t go, don’t stop me
If you don’t go, don’t stop me
Praise the Lord
I’m marching on to the Holy Land

I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause;
Maintain the honor of His Word,
The glory of His cross.

I'm not gonna worry
I'm not gonna fret
I'm not gonna speculate or contemplate what hasn't happened yet
I'm not gonna worry
He's got the whole thing in his hands
I won't let it haunt me; I won't let it win
I'm not gonna ruminate or meditate on how it might have been
I'm gonna release it
He's got the whole thing in his hands
I'm not gonna worry
I'm not gonna fret
I'm just gonna wait and see, and in between give thanks for what I get
I'll live in the moment
He's got the whole thing in his hands

I’m pressing on the upward way,
New heights I’m gaining every day;
Still praying as I’m onward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

I'm rejoicing night and day
As I walk the pilgrim way
For the hand of God in all my life I see
And the reason of my bliss
Yes the secret all is this
That the comforter abides in me.

I'm rejoicing night and day
As I walk the pilgrim way
For the hand of God in all my life I see
And the reason of my bliss
Yes the secret all is this
That the comforter abides in me.

Well I'm saved (I'm saved) and I know that I am
I'm saved (I'm saved) and I know that I am
I'm saved (I'm saved) and I know that I am
I'm so glad I know that I am

Intro:
Through my disappointments
Strife and discontentment
I cast my every care upon the Lord
No matter what obsession
Pain or deep depression
I'm standing on the solid rock

In sin I wandered, talents I squandered
I did not heed (my brother) Him whom I need (I needed)
Then Jesus found me from sin and bound me

I'm going up the highway
That leads to mansions grand
 (I know) I've started for that kingdom
Beyond these desert sands
No more I'll stay in Egypt
I'm bound for Beulah land
 (Oh yes) I'm traveling the glory highway

I’m waiting for Thee, Lord,
Thy beauty to see, Lord;
I’m waiting for Thee—
For Thy coming again.
Thou’rt gone over there, Lord,
A place to prepare, Lord,
Thy home I shall share
At Thy coming again.

An image of that heavenly light,
The goal the Church keeps ay in sight,
Christ on the holy mount displays
Where He outshines the sun’s bright rays.

Immanuel, we sing Thy praise;
Thou Prince of Life, Thou Fount of Grace,
With all Thy saints, Thee, Lord, we sing;
Praise, honor, thanks, to Thee we bring.

Immortal honors rest on Jesus’ head;
My God, my portion, and my Living Bread;
In Him I live, upon Him cast my care;
He saves from death, destruction, and despair.

Immortal love, forever full,
Forever flowing free,
Forever shared, forever whole,
A never ebbing sea!

Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.

Impatient heart, be still!
What though He tarries long?
What though the triumph song
Is still (is still) delayed?
Thou hast His promise sure,
And that is all secure;
Be not afraid! Be not afraid!

In a lonely churchyard, many miles away,
Lies your dear old mother, ’neath the cold, cold clay;
Mem’ries oft returning of her tears and sighs,
If you love your mother, meet her in the skies.

In a manger laid so lowly,
Came the Prince of Peace to earth;
While a choir of angels holy
Sang to celebrate His birth.
 “Glory in the highest,"
Sang the glad angelic strain:

In all my Lord's appointed ways,
My journey I'll pursue;
Hinder me not, ye much loved saints,
For I must go with you.
Through floods and flames, if Jesus lead,
I'll follow where he goes;
Hinder me not, shall be my cry,
Though earth and hell oppose.
Through duty, and through trials, too.
I'll go at his command,
Hinder me not, for I am bound
To my Emmanuel's land.
And when my Saviour calls me home,
Still this my cry shall be;
Hinder me not; come, welcome death,
I'll gladly go with thee.

In all my vast concerns with thee,
In vain my soul would try
To shun thy presence, Lord, or flee
The notice of thine eye.
Thy all-surrounding sight surveys
My rising and my rest,
My public walks, my private ways,
The secrets of my breast.
My thoughts lie open to thee, Lord,
Before they're formed within;
And, ere my lips pronounce the word,
Thou know'st the sense I mean.
O wondrous knowledge, deep and high;
Where can a creature hide?
Within thy circling arms I lie,
Beset on every side.
So let thy grace surround me still,
And like a bulwark prove,
To guard my soul from every ill,
Secured by sovereign love.

In anger, Lord, rebuke me not;
Withdraw the dreadful storm;
Nor let Thy fury grow so hot
Against a feeble worm.

’Twas good to sit at Jesus’ feet
In Bethany, dear Bethany!
And feel His tender love so sweet,
In Bethany, dear Bethany!

In Bethlehem a Child was born,
Blessed be His Name, blessed be His Name,
For us His life from earth was torn,

In boundless mercy, gracious Lord, appear,
Darkness dispel, the humble mourner cheer;
Vain thoughts remove, melt down the flinty heart,
Draw every soul to choose the better part.

In Christ there is no East or West,
In Him no South or North;
But one great fellowship of love
Throughout the whole wide earth.

In days of old on Sinai
The Lord Almighty came
In majesty of terror,
In thunder cloud and flame:
On Tabor, with the glory
Of sunniest light for vest,
The excellence of beauty
In Jesus was expressed.

In doubt and temptation I rest, Lord, in Thee;
My hand is in Thy hand, Thou carest for me;
My soul with Thy counsel through life Thou wilt guide,
And afterward make me in glory abide.

In evil long I took delight,
Unawed by shame or fear,
Till a new object struck my sight,
And stopped my wild career.

In full and glad surrender
I give myself to thee,
thine utterly and only
and evermore to be.
O Son of God, who lovest me,
I will be thine alone;
and all I have and am, Lord,
shall henceforth be thine own!
Reign over me, Lord Jesus;
O make my heart thy throne:
it shall be thine, dear Savior,
it shall be thine alone.
O come and reign, Lord Jesus;
rule over everything!
And keep me always loyal,
and true to thee, my King.

In full assurance of Thy grace
To Thee my prayers ascend
In Thine abounding love and truth,
O God, salvation send.

Oh, what wondrous love I see,
Freely shown for you and me,
By the One Who did atone!
Just to show His matchless grace,
Jesus suffered for the race,
In Gethsemane, alone.

My soul finds rest in God alone
Salvation comes from Him
My hope is found in God alone
And we will trust in Him

In God’s Word it is recorded
That this world will not endure;
Then while time is yet afforded
Make your hope of Heaven sure;
For the stars, before the morning,
From their orbits may be hurled,
And the moon may send a warning
That tonight will end the world.

In grace the holy God
Did full salvation plan,
Electing in His sovereign grace
To save rebellious man.

In grief and fear, to Thee, O Lord,
We now for succor fly,
Thine awful judgments are abroad,
O shield us, lest we die!

In Heaven all is gladness—
Here troubles press, and fears;
Here often bowed and sighing,
I eat “the bread of tears."
Here joy and sorrow mingle
For Christ’s beloved bride;
But ’tis not so up yonder,
For there doth joy abide.

There's some people here below (here below)
You know all they do is moan (they moan)
They're practicing for something I don't know (I don't know)
I'm just going to praise His name (praise His name)
 'Til I get it right someday (right someday)
Then I'll be ready when He takes me home (takes me home)

In heavenly love abiding, no change my heart shall fear.
And safe in such confiding, for nothing changes here.
The storm may roar without me, my heart may low be laid,
But God is round about me, and can I be dismayed?

A fervent prayer rose up to heaven,
A fragile soul was losing ground,
Sorting through the earthly babble,
Heaven heard the sound.
This was a life of no distinction
No successes only trials.
Yet gazing down on this unlovely one,
There was love in heaven's eyes.
In heaven's eyes there are no losers,
In heaven's eyes no hopeless cause.
Only people like you
With feelings like me,
Amazed by the grace
We can find in heaven's eyes.
The orphan child, the wayward father,
The homeless traveler in the rain.
When life goes by and no one bothers,
Heaven feels the pain.
Looking down God sees each heartache,
Knows each sorrow, hears each cry.
And looking up we'll see compassion's fire,
Ablaze in heaven's eyes.

In Heav’n above, in Heav’n above,
Where God our Father dwells,
How boundless there the blessedness!
No tongue its greatness tells;
There face to face, and full and free,
Ever and evermore we see—
We see the Lord of hosts!

In his own raiment clad,
with his blood dyed;
women walk sorrowing
by his side.
Follow to Calvary;
tread where he trod,
he who for ever was
Son of God.
On the cross lifted up,
thy face we scan,
bearing that cross for us,
Son of Man.
Thorns form thy diadem,
rough wood thy throne;
for us thy Blood is shed,
us alone.
We see thy title, Lord,
inscribed above:
"Jesus of Nazareth,"
King of love.
O, I will follow thee,
star of my soul,
through the deep shades of life
to the goal.
Yea, let thy cross be borne
each day by me;
mind not how heavy, if
but with thee.
Grant through each day of life
to stand by thee;
with thee, when morning breaks
ever to be.

In His strength we are overcomers
In His strength we are never alone
He will guide us through the night
As we walk in His light
In His strength we are going home

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
In His temple God be praised;
In the high and heavenly places
Be the sounding anthem raised.

In His temple now behold Him,
See the long expected Lord;
Ancient prophets had foretold Him—
God has now fulfilled His word.
Now to praise Him, His redeemed
Shall break forth with one accord.

In His time, in His time.

In homes where pride and splendor
Their silken banners flare,
In homes where childhood tender
Is crushed by every care,
Is heard the cry of anguish
From many a helpless slave,
Where Satan’s captives languish,
And only Christ can save.

I’ve tried in vain a thousand ways
My fears to quell, my hopes to raise;
But what I need, the Bible says,
Is ever, only Jesus.

Pray for the sick and anoint them with oil in Jesus' name
The prayer of faith will make them well in Jesus' name

In Jordan's Tide the Baptist Stands
Immersing the repenting Jews;
The Son of God the rite demands,
Nor dare the holy man refuse;
Jesus descends beneath the wave,
The emblem of his future grave.
Wonder, ye heav'ns! Your Maker lies
In deeps concealed from human view;
Ye saints, behold him sink and rise,
A fit example thus for you;
The sacred record, while you read,
Calls you to imitate the deed.
But lo! From yonder op'ning skies,
What beams of dazzling glory spread!
Dove-like, th'eternal Spirit flies,
And lights on the Redeemer's head;
Amazed they see the pow'r divine,
Around the Savior's temples shine.
But hark, my soul, hark and adore!
What sounds are those which roll along?
Not like loud Sinai's awful roar,
But soft and sweet as Gabriel's song;
"This is my well-beloved Son,
I see well pleased what he hath done."
Thus as th'eternal Father spoke,
Who shakes creation with a nod;
Through parting skies the accents broke,
And bids us hear the Son of God;
O hear the awful word to-day,
Hear all ye nations and obey!

In life’s earnest morning, when our hope was high,
Came Thy voice to summons, not to be put by;
Nor in toil nor sorrow, weakness or dismay,
Need we ever falter—art not Thou our stay?

In loud, exalted strains
The King of Glory praise.
O'er heaven and earth He reigns
Through everlasting days;
But, Zion, thou so richly blest,
Art His delight, His chosen rest.

In love He redeemed me, the Savior divine,
I’m trusting in Him, life eternal is mine;
Unworthy the least of His gifts to receive—
Salvation is mine as on Him I believe.

In lovingkindness Jesus came
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
Through grace He lifted me.

In one true God we all believe,
And to His Name all glory give,
Creator of all things is He
In the Heav’n, the earth, the sea.

In our day of thanksgiving one psalm let us offer
For the saints who before us have found their reward;
When the shadow of death fell upon them, we sorrowed,
But now we rejoice that they rest in the Lord.

In our work and in our play,
Jesus, ever with us stay;
May we always strive to be
True and faithful unto Thee.
Then we truthfully can sing,
We are children of the King.

In our work and in our play,
Jesus, be thou ever near,
Guarding, guiding, all the day,
Keeping in thy holy fear.
Thou didst toil, O royal Child,
In the far-off Holy Land,
Blessing labour undefiled,
Pure and honest, of the hand.
Thou wilt bless our play-hour too,
If we ask thy succour strong;
Watch o'er all we say and do,
Hold us back from guilt and wrong.
O, how happy thus to spend
Work and play-time in his sight,
Till the rest which shall not end,
Till the day which knows not night!

In Paradise reposing,
by life's eternal well,
the tender lambs of Jesus
in greenest pastures dwell.
There palms and tiny crownlets
aglow with brightest gem,
bedeck the baby martyrs
who died in Bethlehem.
With them the rose-wreathed army
of children undefiled,
who passed through mortal torments
for love of Christ the Child;
with them in peace unending,
with them in joyous mirth,
are all the stainless infants
which since have gone from earth.
The angels, once their guardians,
their fellows now in grace,
with them in love adoring,
see God the Father's face.
The lullaby to hush them
in that eternal rest,
is sweet angelic singing,
their nurse God's Mother blest.
O Jesus, loving Shepherd,
who tenderly dost bear
thy lambs in thine own bosom,
bring us to join them there.

In peace and joy I now depart
At God’s disposing;
For full of comfort is my heart,
Soft reposing.
So the Lord hath promised me,
And death is but a slumber.

In praise of God meet duty and delight,
angels and creatures, flesh and spirits blest:
in praise is earth transfigured by the sound
and sight of heaven's everlasting feast.
The desert is refreshed by songs of praise,
relaxed the frown of pride, the stress of grief;
in praise forgotten all our human spite;
in praise the burdened heart finds sure relief.
In praise our art and craft together meet,
inspired, obedient, patient, practical;
in praise join instrument and voice and sound
to make one music for the Lord of all.
No skill of ours, no music made on earth,
no mortal song could scale the height of heaven;
yet stands that cross, through grace ineffable
the instrument of praise to sinners given.
So, confident and festive, let us sing
of wisdom, power and mercy there made known;
the song of Moses and the Lamb be ours,
through Christ raised up to life in God alone.

In remembrance of Me eat this bread
In remembrance of Me drink this wine
In remembrance of Me pray for the time
When God’s own will is done

In righteous glory reigning, our God sits high enthroned,
His right and truth maintaining, His justice making known.
He stands above Time’s river, the worlds within His view,
His right hand will deliver to every man his due.

In royal robes of splendor,
Before the great King’s feet,
The princes of His kingdom,
The crowned Apostles, meet;
To Him their songs adoring
With heart and tongue they bring,
Pure hearts and mighty voices—
E’en as the angels sing.

In Seasons of Grief to My God, I'll Repair
When my heart is o'er-whelmed with sorrow and care;
From the ends of the earth unto thee will I cry,
"Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I."
When Satan, my foe, shall come in like a flood,
To drive my poor soul from the fountain of good,
I'll pray to the Savior who kindly did die,
"Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I!"
And when I have ended my pilgrimage here,
In Jesus' pure righteousness let me appear;
From the swellings of Jordan to thee will I cry,
"Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I!"

In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water’s cool flow bathes the weary one’s feet,
God leads His dear children along.

In sin I once had wandered,
All weary, sad, and lone,
Till Jesus through His mercy
Adopted me His own.
E’er since I learned to trust Him,
His grace doth make me free,
And now I feel His pardon,
He’s everything to me.

In stature grows the heavenly Child,
With death before His eyes;
A Lamb unblemished, meek and mild,
Prepared for sacrifice.

In sweet communion, Lord, with Thee
I constantly abide;
My hand Thou holdest in Thy own
To keep me near Thy side.

In tenderness He sought me,
Weary and sick with sin;
And on His shoulders brought me
Back to His fold again.
While angels in His presence sang
Until the courts of Heaven rang.

There's a great day comin', a great day comin'
There's a great day comin' by and by
When the saints and the sinners shall be parted right and left
Are you ready for that day to come?

In the Bible we are told
Of a prophet who was called
To a city that was steeped in awful sin;
All the people in that place
Were devoid of saving grace,
And the prophet seemed afraid to enter in.

In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

In the blood from the cross,
I have been washed from sin;
But to be free from dross,
Still I would enter in.

In the bonds of death He lay,
Who for our offense was slain,
But the Lord is risen today,
Christ hath brought us life again;
Wherefore let us all rejoice,
Singing loud with cheerful voice.

In the book which Thou art keeping,
In Thy Book of Life so fair,
Tell me, O my Savior, tell me,
Is my name recorded there?
Is it there? Is it there?
In Thy Book of Life so fair?
Tell me, O my Savior, tell me
Is my name recorded there?

In the bulb there is a flower; in the seed, an apple tree;
In cocoons, a hidden promise: butterflies will soon be free!
In the cold and snow of winter there’s a spring that waits to be,
Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.

In the Christian’s home in glory
There remains a land of rest;
There my Savior’s gone before me,
To fulfill my soul’s request.

There’s a country far beyond the starry sky,
There’s a city where there never comes a night;
If we’re faithful we shall go there by and by,
 ’Tis the city where the Lamb is the light.

In the cool of evening, my Lord comes down and walks with me, with me
In the darkest of valleys, He’s there to talk, to talk to me
On the mountains, in the valleys, in the darkest of the night
In my sorrows, in my trials, He whispers it’s all right
In the cool of evening, in the garden of my heart
Oh Christian, why be discouraged when God is on His throne
Oh sinner, why don’t you hasten, can’t you hear Him calling you home?
In the cool of evening, He will walk and talk to you, to yoh

Jesus, I want to be near the cross

In the cross of Christ I glory,
Towering o’er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
Gathers round its head sublime.

In the desert of sorrow and sin,
Lo! I faint as I journey along;
With the warfare without and within,
See my strength and my hope nearly gone.

In the early morning, early,
Ere the dawn was even nigh.

In the field with their flocks abiding,
They lay on the dewy ground;
And glimmering under the starlight,
The sheep lay white around;
When the light of the Lord streamed o’er them,
And lo! from heaven above,
An angel leaned from the glory,
And sang his song of love.
He sang, that first sweet Christmas,
The song that shall never cease.

In the fight, say, does your heart grow weary?
Do you find your path is rough and thorny?
And above the sky is dark and stormy?
Never mind, go on!
Lay aside all fear, and onward pressing,
Bravely fight, and God will give His blessing;
Though the war at times may prove distressing,
Never mind, go on!

I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses.

In the glory of the Father
When our Lord shall come again,
By His angel guards attended,
In His majesty to reign,

In the glow of early morning,
In the solemn hush of night;
Down from Heaven’s open portals,
Steals a messenger of light,
Whispering sweetly to my spirit,
While the hosts of Heaven sing:
This the wondrous thrilling story:
Christ is coming—Christ my King.
This the wondrous thrilling story—
Christ is coming—Christ my King.

In the great triumphant morning,
When we hear the Bridegroom cry,
And the dead in Christ shall rise,
We’ll be changed to life immortal,
In the twinkling of an eye,
And meet Jesus in the skies.

Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home)
Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home)

In the harvest field now ripened
There’s a work for all to do;
Hark! the voice of God is calling
To the harvest calling you.

In the harvest field there is work to do,
For the grain is ripe, and the reapers few;
And the Master’s voice bids the workers true
Heed the call that He gives today.

In the heart of Jesus, there is love for you,
Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?

In the heav’ns the Lord Almighty
Fixed His everlasting throne;
Over all his His dominion,
He is God and He alone.

In the hollow of His hand He will hide me
When doubt and sin draw near,
Though no earthly friend may walk beside me,
I rest secure from fear.

Savior, in Thy holy keeping,
Take, O take our hearts anew;
Guard us from the world’s temptation,
All the pilgrim journey thro’.

In the hour of my distress,
when temptations me oppress,
and when I my sins confess,
sweet Spirit, comfort me.
When I lie within my bed,
sick in heart, and sick in head,
and with doubts discomforted,
sweet Spirit, comfort me.
When the house doth sigh and weep,
and the world is drowned in sleep,
yet mine eyes the watch do keep,
sweet Spirit, comfort me.
When, God knows, I'm tossed about,
either with despair or doubt,
yet, before the glass be out,
sweet Spirit, comfort me.
When the judgment is revealed,
and that opened which was sealed,
when to thee I have appealed,
sweet Spirit, comfort me.

In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
Lest by base denial I depart from Thee.
When Thou seest me waver, with a look recall,
Nor for fear or favor suffer me to fall.

In the house of many mansions,
With its portals bright and fair,
I am laying up my treasures,
And my heart will soon be there.

In the land of fadeless day,
Lies “the city foursquare,"
It shall never pass away,
And there is “no night there."

In the Lord's atoning grief
Be our rest and sweet relief;
Store we deep in heart's recess
All the shame and bitterness:
Thorns and cross and nails and lance,
Wounds, our rich inheritance,
Vinegar and gall and reed,
And the cry his soul that freed.
May these all our spirits fill,
And with love's devotion thrill;
In our souls plant virtue's root,
And mature its glorious fruit.
Crucified, we thee adore;
Thee with all our hearts implore,
Us with all thy saints unite
In the realms of heavenly light.
Christ, by coward hands betrayed,
Christ, for us a captive made,
Christ, upon the bitter Tree
Slain for man, be praise to thee.

In the midst of earthly life
Snares of death surround us;
Who shall help us in the strife
Lest the Foe confound us?
Thou only, Lord, Thou only!
We mourn that we have greatly erred,
That our sins Thy wrath have stirred.
Holy and righteous God!
Holy and mighty God!
Holy and all merciful Savior!
Eternal Lord God!
Save us lest we perish
In the bitter pangs of death.
Have mercy, O Lord!

In the morning I will raise
To my God the voice of praise;
With His kind protection blest,
Sweet and deep has been my rest.

In the name of Christ we gather,
in the name of Christ we sing,
celebrate new vows, new promise
of a life's whole offering,
here ordained to lead God's people
at the Gospel's beckoning.
Sons and daughters of the Spirit--
these are called to teach and care,
called as were the first disciples,
commonwealth of Christ to share,
by the bread and wine and water
sacraments of grace declare.
In the ministry of preaching
may the word spring into life;
in the time of doubt and challenge,
may its truth affirm belief;
in the day of pain and darkness,
heal the hurt of guilt and grief.
Now within this solemn moment
we invoke the power of God--
by the hands laid on in blessing
be there strength to take the load,
be there faithfulness in loving,
be there courage for this road.
Word of joy, enlivening Spirit,
more than lover, parent, friend, 
born in Jesus, born in Mary,
born in us, that love extend,
grow with your chosen servant,
life of God that has no end.

In the name which earth and heaven
Ever worship, praise, and fear,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
We a house have builded here.
Here with prayer its deep foundations,
In the faith of Christ did lay,
Trusting by His help to crown it
With the top-stone in its day.

In the quiet consecration
Of this glad communion hour,
Here we rest in You, Lord Jesus,
Taste Your love, and touch Your power.

In the resurrection morning,
When the trump of God shall sound,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise!
Then the saints will come rejoicing
And no tears will e’er be found,
We shall rise, Hallelujah! we shall rise.

In the resurrection morning
We will see the Savior coming,
And the sons of God a-shouting in the kingdom of the 
Lord.

In the rifted Rock I’m resting;
Safely sheltered, I abide.
There no foes nor storms molest me,
While within the cleft I hide.

In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide!
Oh, how precious are the lessons which I learn at Jesus’ side!
Earthly cares can never vex me, neither trials lay me low;
For when Satan comes to tempt me, to the secret place I go,
To the secret place I go.

I am happy in the service of the King.
I am happy, O so happy!
I have peace and joy that nothing else can bring,
In the service of the King.

In the shadow of His wings
There is rest, sweet rest;
There is rest from care and labor,
There is rest for friend and neighbor;
In the shadow of His wings
There is rest, sweet rest,
In the shadow of His wings
There is rest (sweet rest).

In the silent midnight,
homeless and lone,
Jacob slept aweary
pillowed on a stone.
Far from all who loved him
was the wanderer then,
faring forth to labor 
in the world of men.
Then what sudden glories
flashed across his dream!
Heavenly splendors breaking
over hill and stream;
down from heights of glory,
through the wandering air,
angels, countless angels,
thronged the golden stair.
In the solemn midnight
Jacob woke from sleep,
God was close beside him
in the silent deep:
through the misty morning
soon he must depart,
with the heavenly vision
bright within his heart.
We must take our journey
to the land unknown,
we may fail in courage,
homeless and alone:
angel-hosts to guard us,
God in heaven above:
and we dare not falter
if we trust his love.

In the silent midnight watches,
Standing at your door,
Calls the Savior, pleading, knocking,
Now as oft before.
He would enter with salvation,
Heart oppressed by sin!
Open now the door for Jesus,
Let Him enter in!

There’s a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the age proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of Man shall come in His glory
To take the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the age proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of Man shall come in His glory
To take the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

In the upper room (upper upper, upper upper, upper room)
In the upper room (upper upper, upper upper, upper room)

In the vineyard of our Father
Daily work we find to do;
Scattered fruit our hands may gather,
Though we are but weak and few;
Little clusters
Help to fill the basket, too.

In the vineyard of the Lord,
There is work for all to do;
Will you go and work today,
With a purpose strong and true?

In the warfare that is raging
For the truth and for the right,
When the conflict fierce is raging
With the powers of the night,
God needs people brave and true;
May He then depend on you?

In Thee alone, O Christ, my Lord,
My hope on earth remaineth;
I know Thou wilt Thine aid afford,
Naught else my soul sustaineth.
No strength of man, no earthly stay,
Can help me in the evil day;
Thou, only Thou, canst aid supply.
To Thee I cry;
On Thee I bid my heart rely.

In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust;
Shamed let me never be;
O save me in Thy righteousness,
Give ear, and rescue me.
Be Thou my rock, my dwelling place,
Forever mine, as now;
Salvation Thou hast willed for me,
My rock and fortress, Thou.

In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
I call upon Thy Name;
O save me in Thy righteousness,
Nor let me suffer shame.

In these, the closing days of time,
What joy the glorious hope affords,
That soon—O wondrous truth sublime!
He shall reign, King of kings and Lord of Lords.

In this holy place
As we're face to face
With Your sweet embrace
Surrounding me
healing waters flow
And they wash my soul
All I need to know
Is here in this holy place
O God of grace and holiness
quiet all my busyness
Teach my heart to trust
Teach me to wait
Teach me to wait
Teach me to wait
In this holy place

In this very room 
there's quite enough love for one like me,
And in this very room there's quite enough joy for one like me,
And there's quite enough hope and quite enough power to chase away 
any gloom,
For Jesus, Lord Jesus .is in this very room.

In Thy cleft, O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me!
When the fitful tempest rages, hide Thou me!
Where no mortal arm can sever
From my heart Thy love forever,
Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages, safe in Thee!

In Thy heritage the heathen
Now, O God, triumphant stand;
They defile Thy holy temple,
They destroy Thy chosen land;
Ruthless, they have slain Thy servants,
They have caused Thy saints to mourn;
In the sight of all about us
We endure reproach and scorn.

Savior, in Thy holy keeping,
Take, O take our hearts anew;
Guard us from the world’s temptation,
All the pilgrim journey thro’.

In Thy holy place we bow,
Perfumes sweet to heaven rise,
While our golden censers glow
With the fire of sacrifice.
Saints low bending, prayers ascending,
Holy lips and hands implore;
Faith believing and receiving
Grace from Him Whom we adore.

In Thy Name, O Lord, assembling,
We, Thy people, now draw near;
Teach us to rejoice with trembling,
Speak, and let Thy servants hear—
Hear with meekness,
Hear Thy Word with godly fear.

In Thy wrath and hot displeasure,
Chasten not Thy servant, Lord;
Let Thy mercy, without measure,
Help and peace to me afford.

In time of tribulation, hear, Lord, my feeble 
cries;
With humble supplication to Thee my spirit 
flies;
My heart with grief is breaking, scarce can my 
voice complain;
Mine eyes with tears kept waking, still watch 
and weep in vain.

In token that thou shalt not fear
Christ crucified to own,
We print the cross upon thee here,
And stamp thee His alone.

In Union with the Lamb,
From condemnation free
The saints from everlasting were
And shall forever be
In cov'nant from old.
The sons of God they were
The feelest lamb in Jesus' fold
Was blessed in Jesus there
Its bonds shall never break
Though earth's old columns bow
The stong, the tempted, and the weak
Are one in Jesus now.
With joy lift up your heads
Ye highly favored few
When through the earth destruction spreads
For what shall injure you?
When storms or tempests rise,
Or sins your peace assail,
Your hope in Jesus never dies
'T is cast within the vail.
Here let the weary rest
Who love the Savior's name;
Though with no sweet enjoyment blest
This cov'nant stands the same.

In vain we seek for peace with God,
By methods of our own;
Jesus, there's nothing but thy blood
Can bring us near the throne.
The threat'nings of thy broken law
Impress the soul with dread;
If God the sword of justice draw,
It strikes the spirit dead.
But thine illustrioius sacrifice
Hath answered these demands;
And peace and pardon from the skies
Came down from Jesus' hands.
Here all the ancient types agree,
The altar and the Lamb;
And prophets in their vision see
Salvation through his name.
'Tis by thy death we live, O Lord,
'Tis on thy cross we rest;
Forever be thy love adored
Thy name forever blest.

In vision to His saints God spake:
 “From out the people one I take,
A mighty leader, true and brave,
Ordained, exalted, strong to save.
My chosen servant I appoint,
With holy oil his head anoint;
My hand with him shall still remain,
My arm his strength shall well sustain.

Sleep, Mary sleep, I will be there soon
Entering earth through your precious womb
My child oh my mother of earth
Give me the gift of birth

In Zion’s sacred gates let hymns of praise begin,
While acts of faith and love in ceaseless beauty shine;
In mercy there, while God is known,
Before His throne with songs appear.

In mute astonishment and awe,
The angels learn God’s plan
To send His Uncreated Son
Down to the Earth—as Man!

Infants tossed to and fro (they're babies)
Want their bottles, won't eat meat
Crave that baby food, it's so sweet
Have to be spoonfed, don't they know
If they don't eat right, they'll never grow
Infants tossed to and fro

Infinite excellence Is Thine
Thou lovely Prince of grace!
Thy uncreated beauties shine
With never-fading rays.

Infinite God, to Thee we raise
Our hearts in solemn songs of praise,
By all Thy works on earth adored,
We worship Thee, the common Lord;
The everlasting Father own,
And bow our souls before Thy throne.

Oh how happy I will be when life's journey here is run
And I look upon His face and I hear Him say, "Well done
You have fought a faithful fight and my child you've kept the faith
Enter now my joys are yours, so just step inside the gate"

Inspirer and hearer of prayer,
Thou Shepherd and Guardian of Thine,
My all to Thy covenant care,
I, sleeping or waking, resign.

I don’t know why I just start to cry sometimes and I feel so alone
The pain is too much and I long for Your touch inside satisfying my soul
But I know that You’re shaping me every day
And I don’t want to be a lump of unsculpted clay

Into Jerusalem Jesus rode,
triumphant king acclaimed;
palm branches spread to honor his way,
garments laid down as tokens of praise;
shouts of "Hosanna" surged through the throng
into Jerusalem.
Within Jerusalem Jesus stood,
masquerade king reviled;
thorns made a crown (grim satire of truth),
robe like a wound thrown over his back;
echoes of "Crucify" filled the air
within Jerusalem.
Outside Jerusalem Jesus hung,
crucified King despised;
wood formed a cross suspending his life;
soldiers cast lots to deal out his clothes;
his lonely cries: "My God"; 
"It is done," outside Jerusalem.

Into the heart of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go,
Seeking to know the reason
Why He should love me so,
Why He should stoop to lift me
Up from the miry clay,
Saving my soul, making me whole,
Though I had wandered away.

Into the tent where a gypsy boy lay,
Dying alone at the close of the day,
News of salvation we carried; said he:
 “Nobody ever has told it to me!"

Into the woods my Master went,
Clean forspent, forspent,
Into the woods my Master came,
Forspent with love and shame.
But the olives they were not blind to Him.
The little grey leaves were kind to Him,
The thorn tree had a mind to Him,
When into the woods He came.

Into Thine hand, O God of truth,
My spirit I commit;
Thou hast redeemed my soul from death,
And saved me from the pit.

Invisible hands (invisible hands) are waiting to guide you
Invisible hands (invisible hands) will show you the way (will show you the 
way)
Have faith in the Lord (have faith in the Lord), He's always beside you
So pray and believe, and help you'll receive from invisible hands

Invited, Lord, by boundless grace,
I stand a guest before Thy face;
As Host Thou spreadst no common food:
Here is Thy body and Thy blood.

Holy Messiah (He's born a Savior)
Holy Messiah (He's born a Savior)
Holy Messiah (He's born a Savior)
Holy Messiah

Is it for me, dear Savior,
Thy glory and Thy rest,
For me, so weak and sinful?
O shall I be so blessed?

Wondrous it seemeth to me
Jesus so gracious should be,
Mercy revealing, comforting, healing,
Blessing a sinner like me.

Jesus may come today
Glad day, glad day!
And I would see my Friend;
Dangers and troubles would end
If Jesus would come today.

Is my hope on the rifted Rock,
Cleft by the Lord for me?
Is my name in the book of life?
O that my faith could see!

Lord, I care not for riches, neither silver nor gold;
I would make sure of Heaven, I would enter the fold.
In the book of Thy kingdom, with its pages so fair,
Tell me, Jesus, my Savior, is my name written there?

I am dwelling on the mountain,
Where the golden sunlight gleams
O’er a land whose wondrous beauty
Far exceeds my fondest dreams,
Where the air is pure, ethereal,
Laden with the breath of flowers,
They are blooming by the fountain,
’Neath the amaranthine bow’rs.

I was standing on the banks of the river
Looking out over life's troubled sea
When I saw that old ship that was sailing
Is that the old ship of Zion I see?

There's a power to heal and make new
There was a man who lived long, long ago
Who knew His Father's will
To an Old Rugged Cross He knew He'd go
His purpose to fulfill

Is there a heart bent o’er with sorrow?
Is there a life weighed down by care?
Come to the cross, each burden bearing;
All your anxiety—leave it there.

Is there a heart that is waiting,
Longing for pardon today?
Hear the glad message proclaiming,
Jesus is passing this way.

Is there any room for Jesus?
He Who died on Calvary,
He Who standeth, knocking, waiting,
Pleading with you tenderly.

Savior, may a little child
In its weakness, come to Thee?
Thou wert ever meek and mild;
Can my heart as gentle be?

Is this the kind return,
And these the thanks we owe,
Thus to abuse eternal love,
Whence all our blessings flow?

Is thy cruse of comfort wasting?
Rise, and with thy brother share.
And through all the years of famine
On its bounty ye shall fare.

Have thy affections been nailed to the cross?
Is thy heart right with God?
Dost thou count all things for Jesus but loss?
Is thy heart right with God?

You have longed for sweet peace,
And for faith to increase,
And have earnestly, fervently prayed;
But you cannot have rest,
Or be perfectly blest,
Until all on the altar is laid.

Is your hope of glory bright?
Are you walking in the light,
Ever shining from the Savior’s throne?
Have you gone to Him for rest,
When your heart was sore oppressed?
Are you trusting in His arm alone?

Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is the love of God flowing through you?
Are you telling the lost of the Savior?
Are you ready His service to do?

Isaiah, mighty seer, in days of old
The Lord of all in spirit did behold
High on a lofty throne, in splendor bright,
With flowing train that filled the temple quite.
Above the throne were stately seraphim;
Six wings had they, these messengers of Him.
With twain they veiled their faces, as was meet,
With twain in reverent awe they hid their feet,
And with the other twain aloft they soared,
One to the other called and praised the Lord:
“Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth!
Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth!
Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth!
Behold, His glory filleth all the earth!"
The beams and lintels trembled at the cry,
And clouds of smoke enwrapped the throne on high.

There will never be a sweeter story,
Story of the Savior's love divine,
Love that bro't Him from the realms of glory
Just to save a sinful soul like mine
Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful,
Wonderful, wonderful,
O,  Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful!
Wonderful it is to me.
Boundless as the universe around me
Reaching to the farthest soul away,
Saving, keeping love it was that found me,
That is why my heart can truly say.

It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold;
 “Peace on the earth, good will to men,
From Heaven’s all gracious King."
The world in solemn stillness lay,
To hear the angels sing.

There is a stream that flows from Calvary,
A crimson tide so deep and wide.
It washes whiter than the purest snow;
It cleanseth me, I know.

It fell upon a summer day,
When Jesus walked in Galilee,
The mothers from a village brought
Their children to His knee.

It Is A Glorious Mystery -- 'Tis a Wonder
That ever I should saved be ' Tis a wonder
No heart can think, no tongue can tell,
'Tis a wonder, wonder, wonder,
The love of God unspeakable 'tis a wonder.
Great mystery, that God should place
His love on one of Adam's race,
That I should also share a part,
And find a mansion in His heart.
Great mystery, I can't tell why
That Christ for sinful worms should die;
Should leave the boundless realms of bliss,
And die for sinners on the cross.
Oh! Why was I not left behind,
Among the thousands of mankind,
Who run the dang'rous sinful race,
And die, and never taste His grace?
'Twas love that spread the gracious feast;
'Twas love that made my soul a guest;
'Twas love that brought Him from above;
'Twas love, Oh! Matchless, boundless love.
Not all the heav'nly hosts can scan
The glories of this noble plan;
Oh! 'Tis a glorious mystery,
And will be to eternity.

It is a thing most wonderful,
Almost too wonderful to be,
That God’s own Son should come from Heav’n,
And die to save a child like me.

Nothing, either great or small—
Nothing, sinner, no;
Jesus died and paid it all,
Long, long ago.

It is finished! Christ hath known
All the life of men wayfaring;
Human joys and sorrows sharing,
Making human needs His own.
Lord, in us Thy life renewing,
Lead us where Thy feet have trod,
Till, the way of truth pursuing,
Human souls find rest in God.

It is finished! Christ hath known
all the life of men wayfaring;
human joys and sorrows sharing,
making human needs his own.
Lord, in us thy life renewing,
lead us where thy feet have trod,
till, the way of truth pursuing,
human souls find rest in God.
It is finished! Christ is slain,
on the altar of creation,
offering for a world's salvation
sacrifice of love and pain.
Lord, thy love through pain revealing,
purge our passions, scourge our vice,
till, upon the tree of healing,
self is slain in sacrifice.
It is finished! Christ our King
wins the victor's crown of glory;
sun and stars recite his story,
floods and fields his triumph sing.
Lord, whose praise the world is telling,
Lord, to whom all power is given,
by thy death, hell's armies quelling,
bring thy saints to reign in heaven.

It is finished! Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast breathed Thy latest sigh,
Teaching us the sons of Adam
How the Son of God can die.

“It is finished!" Man of Sorrows!
From Thy cross our frailty borrows
Strength to bear and conquer thus.

It is glory just to walk with Him Whose blood has ransomed me;
It is rapture for my soul each day.
It is joy divine to feel Him near where’er my path may be.
Bless the Lord, it’s glory all the way!

When the cares of life oppress you
And the load is hard to bear;
When your troubles great distress you
And there’s none who seems to care;
Talk to Jesus, He will bless you
And your every burden share;
It is glory to talk with Him.

It is good for us to be here
Praise the Lord
And it's good to sing His praises
Praise the Lord
Give your praise to God on high
Lift your voices to the sky

It is good to sing Thy praises and to thank Thee, O Most High,
Showing forth Thy lovingkindness when the morning lights the sky.
It is good when night is falling of Thy faithfulness to tell,
While with sweet, melodious praises, songs of adoration swell.

The stage was set, it was the first coming
A baby boy, as the angel said
To the shepherds the wise men, oh could this be?
The Messiah our Savior, oh is this He?

The storm in all its fury
Swept dark Gennesaret;
They cried in vain for succor,
Till Hope’s lone star had set;
Then Christ came on the waters
In answer to their cry,
And spake in tones of comfort,
 “Fear not, for it is I.
Fear not, for it is I."

Is it me Lord
Tell me am I the one
Is it me Lord
Losing sight of the Son
Just as Judas betrayed
From the Saviour I've strayed
Is it me Lord
Am I the one

God’s abiding peace is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now, yes I feel it now;
He has taken all my doubts and fears away,
Tho’ I cannot tell you how.

It is not death to die,
To leave this weary road,
And midst the brotherhood on high
To be at home with God.

He pardoned my transgressions,
He sanctified my soul,
He honors my confessions,
Since by His blood I’m whole.

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking
That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory
To receive from the world “His own."

It may be in the valley, where countless dangers hide;
It may be in the sunshine that I, in peace, abide;
But this one thing I know—if it be dark or fair,
If Jesus is with me, I’ll go anywhere!

It may not be on the mountain’s height, or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle’s front my Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls to paths I do not know,
I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Yours,
I’ll go where You want me to go.

It may not be our lot to wield
The sickle in the ripened field;
Nor ours to hear, on summer eves,
The reaper’s song among the sheaves.

“It must be settled tonight,
Tomorrow may be too late";
The angel of death may come,
And seal forever my fate.
It must be settled to-night,
I can no longer wait,
Peace with my God I now must have,
Tomorrow may be too late.

It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine!
My Jesus! Savior! yet this soul of mine
Would of that love, in all its depth and length,
Its height and breadth, and everlasting strength
Know more and more.

The service of Jesus true pleasure affords,
In Him there is joy without an alloy;
 ’Tis Heaven to trust Him and rest on His words;
It pays to serve Jesus each day.

It was alone the Savior prayed
In dark Gethsemane;
Alone He drained the bitter cup
And suffered there for me.

It was His will (it was His will), His Son would suffer (His Son would 
suffer)
It was His will (it was His will), He'd take the blame
There simply could (could not be) not be another (no, not one)
The lamb of God for us was slain

It was midnight in the valley, and the camp was dark and still,
Where the slumb’ring host of Midian lay along the sloping hill,
When a blinding flash of torches, and a trumpet loud and shrill,

It was poor little Jesus, yes, yes;
he was born on Christmas, yes, yes;
and laid in a manger, yes, yes;
wasn't that a pity and a shame, Lord, Lord,
wasn't that a pity and shame?
It was poor little Jesus, yes, yes;
child of Mary, yes, yes;
didn't have a cradle, yes, yes;
wasn't that a pity and a shame, Lord, Lord,
wasn't that a pity and shame?
It was poor little Jesus, yes, yes;
they nailed him to the cross, Lord, yes, yes;
they hung him with a robber, yes, yes;
wasn't that a pity and a shame, Lord, Lord,
wasn't that a pity and shame?
It was poor little Jesus, yes, yes;
he's risen from darkness, yes, yes;
he's 'scended into glory, yes, yes;
no more a pity and a shame, Lord, Lord,
no more a pity and shame?

I don't care what my friends say
When Christmas comes around
I don't care what my friends say
I really know what it's all about
It's not the toys, It's not the sweets
It's not Rudolph or stocking treats
It's not the snow, It's not the lights
Christmas Trees or "A Wonderful Life"
I know what it's all about (about Jesus)
I know what it's all about (about Jesus)

You give me life, you give me breath
You give me everything I’ll ever have
You give me love, you give me peace
You give me everything I’ll ever need
It’s all from yoh

I said it’s all right (It’s all right)
It’s all right (It’s all right)
It’s all right (It’s all right)
It’s all right (It’s all right)
Don’t you know that
Just a little talk with Jesus makes it right (just a talk with Jesus)
Do you know it’s all right (it’s all right)
It’s all right (It’s all right)
It’s all right (It’s all right)
It’s all right (It’s all right)
Don’t you know that
Just a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Well, It's gonna rain
Well, it's gonna rain
Oh, you better get ready
And bear this in mind
For God showed Noah the rainbow sign
 "It won't be water, but fire this time"

I can hardly wait, you know it's gonna be here
The show of a lifetime, I've been waitin' for years
I'm getting front row seats, and you'd better believe that
No price is too high
For that glorious spectacle coming,
Coming out of the sky!

A friend I have called Jesus, Whose love is strong and true,
And never fails howe’er ’tis tried, no matter what I do;
I’ve sinned against this love of His, but when I knelt to pray,
Confessing all my guilt to Him, the sin clouds rolled away.

Troubles come and I can't find an answer
Lonely nights I spend in agony
I have no other friend that I can turn to
So here I am Lord back on my knees.
It's me again Lord,' I've got a prayer that needs an answer
It's me again Lord, I've got a problem I can't solve
Well I don't mean to worry you but here I am facing something new
And I need help that only comes from You, it's me again Lord.
Well I know You're mighty busy in Your Heaven
Forming worlds and hanging stars to shine
But You promised if I'd ask I'd receive it
So here I am Lord asking one more time.

Won't you listen to what I've got to say to you
It could be wrong but then again it could be true
And if it's true, you need to take a second look 
Just to see if what I'm telling you is by The Book
You see, now many declare that they are preachin' the word
And though they may sound mighty pretty what they say's absurd
I'm am not eloquent, I know I may sound rough
I'm just tryin' to make a simple point -- It's not enough

I lie awake at night, thinkin' about what I've done
I try to make it all right, but You're the only one
That can change me inside and cleanse my soul again
Without You I am lost forever
What a wretched man I am

If you are facing troubles
And it seems you’re losing it
And if you’ve been forsaken
By your friends and loved ones
It’s not over
Until we win it’s not over
It’s not over
Until we win it’s never over
The Lord Jesus promised
To give us life in abundance
So don’t be afraid
Because it’s not over
So just be strong
For the Lord is with you
So go ahead in this battle
Because the VICTORY is ours

There's a secret sin that you live with
And it's tearing you apart
You've prayed and prayed but now you're ashamed
To ask God to cleanse your heart
But even though you've fallen again
When you kneel before Him

O how well do I remember
How I doubted day by day,
For I did not know for certain
That my sins were washed away.
When the Spirit tried to tell me,
I would not the truth receive;
I endeavored to be happy
And to make myself believe.

There is a story, speaks of glory, so I've learned
Knowing the Savior, new behavior, through His words
Presence of power, at any hour, I am sure
Through my trials, no denials, I'm secure
You might not see why He cares
So I need to share (I need to share His love)

I’ve a home prepared where the saints abide,
Just over in the glory land;
And I long to be by my Savior’s side,
Just over in the glory land.

I’ve a message from the Lord, Hallelujah!
The message unto you I’ll give;
’Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah!
It is only that you “look and live."

I’ve a Savior, kind and tender,
I’ve a Savior full of grace;
And a smile of winning sweetness
Ever beams upon His face:
In my heart’s shrine of affection
He shall hold the highest place.

Upon life’s boundless ocean where mighty billows roll,
I’ve fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering o’er,
I rest upon His mercy and trust Him more.

“I’ve anchored my soul in the Haven of Rest";
I’ve pillowed my head on the dear Savior’s breast;
I’m trusting His promise of mercy so free;
Fear not, “For My grace is sufficient for thee."

Well I've been to the river, I've been baptized
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb
I've been changed from the creature that once I was

I’ve believed the true report,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the outer court,
O glory be to God!
I am all on Jesus’ side,
On the altar sanctified,
To the world and sin I’ve died,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I've cast my heavy burdens down on Canaan's happy shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
I'll wander in the wilderness of doubt and sin no more;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

I’ve enlisted in the army of the Lord today,
Fighting ever for the truth and right;
Safely guided by Jehovah in the King’s highway,
He will lead His army day and night.

I’ve entered the land dearly bought by His blood,
Passed over Jordan, surrendered to God;
I’ve found His sufficiency here in this land,
Glory to Jesus forever!

I’ve found a Friend, O such a friend! He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love, and thus He bound me to Him;
And round my heart still closely twine those ties which naught can 
sever,
For I am His, and He is mine, forever and forever.

I’ve found a Friend, Who is all to me,
His love is ever true;
I love to tell how He lifted me
And what His grace can do for you.

I’ve found a joy in sorrow, a secret balm for pain,
A beautiful tomorrow of sunshine after rain;
I’ve found a branch of healing near every bitter spring;
A whispered promise stealing o’er every broken string,
A whispered promise stealing o’er every broken string.

I’ve found a refuge from life’s cares in Jesus,
I am hiding in His love divine;
He fully understands my soul’s deep longing,
And He whispers softly, “Thou art Mine."

Oh, I sought so long for something,
That would give me joy and peace within;
Till at last I came to Jesus
And He cleansed my heart from ev’ry sin.

I’ve found the Pearl of greatest price,
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine;
Christ shall my song employ.

I’ve found the secret of success,
 ’Tis holding, ’tis holding on;
The way to every blessedness,
 ’Tis holding, ’tis holding on;
Our warfare may be hard and fierce,
Oft Satan’s arrows wound and pierce,
But still we get more smiles than tears
By holding on, by holding on.

I’ve got a Father
We’ve got a Father

When trouble is in my way
I can't tell the night from day
When I toss from side to side
Like a ship on the raging tide
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Troubles come from time to time
But that's all right, 'cause I'm not the worrying kind

I’ve got peace like a river,
I’ve got peace like a river,
I’ve got peace like a river in my soul,
I’ve got peace like a river,
I’ve got peace like a river,
I’ve got peace like a river in my soul.

I've got the joy of the Lord (I've got the joy of the)
I've got the joy of the Lord (I've got the joy of the)
I've got the joy of the Lord (I've got the joy of the)
Oh, I've got the joy of the Lord (I've got the joy of the, joy of the 
Lord)
I've got the joy of the Lord

I've got the Spirit
The Spirit within me
I've got the joy
Down deep in my soul
I've got a feelin'
A wonderful feelin'
I've got the Spirit
And He's takin' control

There's a light in the window
And the table's set in splendor
Someone's standing by the open door (open door)
I can see a crystal river
Oh I must be near forever
And I've never been this homesick before

I long ago left Egypt for the promised land,
I trusted in my Savior, and to His guiding hand;
He led me out to vict’ry through the great Red Sea,
I sang a song of triumph, and shouted, I am free!

I’ve reached the land of corn and wine,
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

I’ve seen the lightning flashing, I’ve heard the thunder roll.
I’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing, which almost conquered my soul.
I’ve heard the voice of my Savior, bidding me still to fight on.
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone!

I’ve tried in vain a thousand ways
My fears to quell, my hopes to raise;
But what I need, the Bible says,
Is ever, only Jesus.

I've wandered far away from God,
Now I'm coming home;
The paths of sin too long I've trod,
Lord, I'm coming home.

My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
With joy my being thrills.

Jehovah, God the Father, bless,
And Thy own work defend!
With mercy’s outstretched arms embrace
And keep us to the end!

Jehovah, God, Thy gracious power,
On every hand we see;
Oh, may the blessings of each hour
Lead all our thoughts to Thee.

Jehovah hear thee in thy grief,
Our fathers’ God defend thee still,
Send from His holy place relief,
And strengthen thee from Zion’s hill.

Jehovah is my Light,
And my Salvation near;
Who shall my soul affright,
Or cause my heart to fear?
While God my strength, my life sustains,
Secure from fear my soul remains.

We will not serve your god
Jehovah is our King

Jehovah is our Strength,
And He shall be our Song
We shall o’ercome at length
Although our foes be strong.
In vain does Satan then oppose,
For God is stronger than His foes.

Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
His grace is sufficient for me
For me, for me!
Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
His grace is sufficient for me
My God shall provide all my needs
According to His riches in glory
He shall give His angels charge over me
Jehovah Jireh cares for me
For me, for me!
Jehovah Jireh cares for me
Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
His grace is sufficient for me
For me, for me!
Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
His grace is sufficient for me
My God shall provide all my needs
According to His riches in glory
He shall give His angels charge over me
Jehovah Jireh cares for me
For me, for me!
Jehovah Jireh cares for me

Jehovah reigns in majesty,
Let all the nations quake;
He dwells between the cherubim,
Let earth’s foundations shake.
Supreme in Zion is the Lord,
Exalted gloriously,
Ye nations, praise His Name with awe,
The Holy One is He.

JEHOVAH reigns on high
In peerless majesty;
Boundless power his royal robe,
Purest light his garment is;
Rules his word the spacious globe,
Stablished it in floating seas.

Jehovah reigns, let earth be glad,
And all the isles their joy make 
known;
With clouds and darkness He is clad,
On truth and justice rests His 
throne.

Jehovah, God, Thy gracious power,
On every hand we see;
Oh, may the blessings of each hour
Lead all our thoughts to Thee.

Jehovah, God, Who dwelt of old
In temples made with hands,
Thy power display, Thy truth unfold,
Where this new temple stands.

Jehovah, let me now adore Thee,
For where is there a God, such, Lord, as 
Thou?
With songs I fain would come before Thee;
O let Thy Holy Spirit teach me now
To praise Thee in His Name through Whom 
alone
Our songs can please Thee, through Thy 
blessed Son.

Jehovah, my God, on Thy help I depend;
From all that pursue me O save and 
defend;
Lest they like a lion should rend me at 
will:
While no one is near me their raging to 
still.

Jehovah, Thee we praise,
The triune God adore;
To Father, Son and Spirit raise
Glad anthems evermore,
Glad anthems evermore.

Jehovah, to my prayer give ear,
Nor hide Thee from my cry;
Attend my sad complaint, and 
hear
My restless moan and sigh.
My enemies lift up their voice,
The violent oppress;
To do me wrong my foes rejoice,
And love my soul’s distress.

Jehovah’s perfect law
Restores the soul again;
His testimony sure
Gives wisdom to men;
The precepts of the Lord are 
right,
And fill the heart with great 
delight.

Down, down, down
And the walls of Jericho are coming down
Down, down, down
Yes, the walls of Jericho are coming down

And did those feet in 
ancient time
Walk upon England’s 
mountains green?
And was the Holy Lamb of 
God
On England’s pleasant 
pastures seen?
And did the countenance 
divine
Shine forth upon our 
clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded 
here
Among these dark satanic 
mills?

Jerusalem! high tower thy glorious walls,
would God I were in thee!
Desire of thee my longing heart enthralls,
desire at home to be;
wide from the world outleaping,
o'er hill and vale and plain,
my soul's strong wind is sweeping
thy portals to attain.
O gladsome day and yet more gladsome hour!
When shall that hour have come
when my rejoicing soul its own free power
may use in going home,
itself to Jesus giving
in trust to his own hand,
to dwell among the living
in that blest fatherland?
Unnumbered choirs before the Lamb's high throne
there shout the jubilee,
with loud resounding peal and sweetest tone,
in blissful ecstasy:
a hundred thousand voices
take up the wondrous song;
eternity rejoices
God's praises to prolong.

Jerusalem on high, 
my song that city 
is,
My home whene’er I 
die, the center of 
my bliss;
O happy place! When 
shall I be,
My God, with Thee, 
to see Thy face?

Jerusalem the 
golden, with milk 
and honey blest,
Beneath thy 
contemplation 
sink heart and 
voice oppressed.
I know not, O I 
know not, what 
joys await us 
there,
What radiancy of 
glory, what bliss 
beyond compare.

Jerusalem, thou city fair and high,
Would God I were in thee!
My longing heart fain, fain to thee would fly,
It will not stay with me.
Far over vale and mountain,
Far over field and plain,
It hastes to seek its Fountain
And leave this world of pain.

Jerusalem! high tower thy glorious walls,
would God I were in thee!
Desire of thee my longing heart enthralls,
desire at home to be;
wide from the world outleaping,
o'er hill and vale and plain,
my soul's strong wind is sweeping
thy portals to attain.
O gladsome day and yet more gladsome hour!
When shall that hour have come
when my rejoicing soul its own free power
may use in going home,
itself to Jesus giving
in trust to his own hand,
to dwell among the living
in that blest fatherland?
Unnumbered choirs before the Lamb's high throne
there shout the jubilee,
with loud resounding peal and sweetest tone,
in blissful ecstasy:
a hundred thousand voices
take up the wondrous song;
eternity rejoices
God's praises to prolong.

Jerusalem, arise,
The heavenly glory view;
The light is come, lift 
up thine eyes,
All things are now made 
new.

Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
Thou city ever blest,
Within thy portals 
first I find
My safety, peace and 
rest.
Here dangers always 
threaten me,
My days in strife are 
spent,
And labor, sorrow, 
worry, grief,
I find at best their 
strength.

Jerusalem, lift up 
thy voice!
Daughter of Zion, now 
rejoice!
Thy King is come, 
Whose mighty hand
Henceforth shall 
reign o’er every 
land.

Jerusalem, my happy 
home,
When shall I come 
to thee?
When shall my 
sorrows have an 
end?
Thy joys when shall 
I see?

Jerusalem, thou 
City bright
From Heav’n to 
earth 
descending,
How wondrously 
their holy 
light
Thy precious 
stones are 
blending.

Jesu 
hail! O 
God 
most 
holy,
Gentle 
Lamb, 
an 
Infant 
lowly;
Born, 
great 
God, a 
human 
stranger,
Laid 
within 
the 
narrow 

Jesu, who this our Lenten-tide
Of abstinence hast sanctified,
Be with thy Church in saving power
In this her penitential hour.
And, as thou dost forgive the past,
Thy sheltering arms around us cast,
That we may in thy grace remain
And fall not back to sins again.
Make, Lord, this Lenten discipline
An expiation for our sin;
And through these days ourselves prepare
The joys of Eastertide to share.

Jesu, for the 
beacon-light
By Thy holy 
Doctors 
given,
When the 
mists of 
error’s 
night,
Gathered o’er 
the path to 
Heav’n;
For the 
witness that 
they bare
To the truth 
they learned 
of Thee,
For the glory 
that they 
share,
Let our 
praise 
accepted be.

Jesu, 
grant me 
this, I 
pray,
Ever in 
Thy heart 
to stay;
Let me 
evermore 
abide
Hidden in 
Thy 
wounded 
side.

Jesu, 
joy 
of 
man’s 
desiring,
Holy 
wisdom, 
love 
most 
bright;
Drawn 
by 
Thee, 
our 
souls 
aspiring
Soar 
to 
uncreated 
light.
Word 
of 
God, 
our 
flesh 
that 
fashioned,
With 
the 
fire 
of 
life 
impassioned,
Striving 
still 
to 
truth 
unknown,
Soaring, 
dying 
round 
Thy 
throne.

Jesu, 
Lord 
of 
life 
and 
glory,
Bend 
from 
Heav’n 
Thy 
gracious 
ear;
While 
our 
waiting 
souls 
adore 
Thee,
Friend 
of 
helpless 
sinners, 
hear:
By 
Thy 
mercy, 
O 
deliver 
us, 
good 
Lord.

Jesu, 
meek 
and 
lowly,
Savior, 
pure 
and 
holy,
On 
Thy 
love 
relying
Hear 
me 
humbly 
crying.

Jesu, my Savior, Brother, Friend,
On Whom I cast my every care,
On Whom for all things I depend,
Inspire, and then accept, my prayer.

Jesu! Name all names above,
Jesu, best and dearest,
Jesu, fount of perfect love,
Holiest, tenderest, nearest;
Jesu, source of grace completest,
Jesu purest, Jesu sweetest,
Jesu well of power divine,
Make me, keep me, seal me Thine.

Jesu, our Hope, our heart’s Desire,
Thy work of grace we sing;
Redeemer of the world art Thou,
Its Maker and its King.

Jesu, our Lenten fast of Thee
We duteous learn to keep,
A healing time, by Thy decree,
For all Thy wounded sheep.

Jesu! speak to me in love,
Restless, storm tossed in my sin;
With Thy mighty voice, O Lord,
Thy great calm create within;
Bid the stormy winds to cease,
Bid, O bid me go in peace.

Jesu, the Father’s only Son,
Whose death for all redemption won;
Before the worlds of God most high
Begotten all ineffably.

Jesu! the very thought is sweet!
In that dear Name all heart-joys meet;
But sweeter than the honey far
The glimpses of His presence are.

Jesu, the virgins’ Crown, do Thou
Accept us as in prayer we bow,
Born of that virgin whom alone
The mother and the maid we own.

Jesu, the world’s redeeming Lord,
The Father’s co-eternal Word,
Of light invisible true Light,
Thine Israel’s Keeper day and night.

Jesu, Thy mercies are untold
Through each returning day;
Thy love exceeds a thousandfold
Whatever we can say.

Jesus a child His work begun:
How radiant dawned His heavenly day!
And those who such a race would run
As early should be on their way.

Jesus, all my gladness,
my repose in sadness,
Jesus, heaven to me;
ah, my heart long paineth,
ah, my spirit straineth,
longeth after thee!
Thine I am, O holy Lamb;
only where thou art is pleasure,
thee alone I treasure.
Hence with earthly treasure:
thou art all my pleasure,
Jesus my desire!
Hence, for pomps I care not,
e'en as though they were not
rank and fortune's hire.
Want and gloom, cross, death, and tomb;
nought that I may suffer ever
shall from Jesus sever.
Flee, dark clouds that lower,
for my joy-bestower,
Jesus, enters in!
Joy from tribulation,
hope from desolation,
they who love God win.
Be it blame or scorn or shame,
thou art with me in earth's sadness,
Jesus, all my gladness.

My Jesus died for me upon the cross,
There for Him I’ve counted all but loss;
When my soul beheld Him on the tree,
Conscience said His dying was for me:
All my heart was captured by His love,
Filled with glory streaming from above.

Jesus, and shall it ever be,
A mortal man, ashamed of Thee?
Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise,
Whose glories shine through endless days?

Jesus got His arms all around me
Jesus got His arms all around me

There’s One Who can comfort when all else fails,
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
A Savior Who saves tho’ the foe assails,
Jesus, blessed Jesus:
Once He traveled the way we go,
Felt the pangs of deceit and woe;
Who more perfectly then can know,
Than Jesus, blessed Jesus?

Jesus, Brightness of the Father,
Life and Strength of all who live,
For creating guardian angels
Glory to Thy Name we give
And Thy wondrous praise rehearse,
Singing in harmonious verse.

Jesus calls us over the tumult
Of our life’s wild, restless, sea;
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
Saying, “Christian, follow Me!"

Jesus came down my ransom to be;
O it was wonderful love!
For out of the Father’s heart He came,
To die me for me on a cross of shame,
And from sin’s bondage to reclaim;
O it was wonderful love!

Jesus came into my heart one day,
Taking my burdens and sins away,
Bringing a peace that ever stays;
Wonderful, boundless peace.

Jesus came to earth by a lowly birth,
Gave Himself as an offering of matchless worth;
To His own He came in His Father’s Name,
But they scorned to receive Him their King.

Jesus came, the heav’ns adoring,
Came with peace from realms on high;
Jesus came for man’s redemption,
Lowly came on earth to die.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Came in deep humility.

Merry, merry, merry, Merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, Merry Christmas

Jesus Christ from death hath risen!
Lo, his Godhead bursts the prison,
while his Manhood passes free,
vanquishing our misery:
risen with him to salvation
through his self-humiliation,
we may share his victory.
Far be sorrow, tears and sadness!
See the dayspring of our gladness!
Satan's slaves no more are we,
children by the Son set free:
rise, for Life with death hath striven,
all the snares of hell are riven;
rise and claim the victory.
the feast, good Christians, therefore keep;
the Lamb has bled to save the sheep
Christ innocent, our ransom paid,
mankind and God at one hath made:
Alleluia, alleluia!
Jesus Christ is risen:
speak, Mary Magdalen, and say
what sawest thou upon the way?
"I saw the grave, and there adored
the glory of the risen Lord:"
Alleluia, alleluia!
Jesus Christ is risen:
"Within the grave on either hand
I saw a white-robed angel stand;
my Savior Christ, my hope, my stay,
hath risen from the tomb today:"
Alleluia, alleluia!
Jesus Christ is risen:
we know for certain, truth to tell,
that Christ arose from death and hell;
and while thy Paschal song we sing,
have pity on us, Victor-King:
Alleluia, alleluia!

Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia!
Our triumphant holy day, Alleluia!
Who did once, upon the cross, Alleluia!
Suffer to redeem our loss, Alleluia!

Jesus Christ, our Lord most holy,
Lamb of God so pure and lowly,
Blameless, blameless, on the cross art offered,
Sinless, sinless, for our sins hast suffered.

Jesus Christ, my sure Defense
And my Savior, ever liveth;
Knowing this, my confidence
Rests upon the hope it giveth
Though the night of death be fraught
Still with many an anxious thought.

Jesus Christ, our blessed Savior,
Turned away God’s wrath forever;
By His bitter grief and woe
He saved us from the evil Foe.


Jesus comes with all his grace,
Comes to save a fallen race:
Object of our glorious hope,
Jesus comes to lift us up.
Alleluia!
Let the living stones cry out;
Let the seed of Abraham shout;
Praise we all our lowly King,
Give him thanks, rejoice, and sing.
Alleluia!
He has our salvation wrought,
He our captive souls has bought,
He has reconciled to God,
He has washed us in his blood.
Alleluia!
We are now his lawful right,
Walk as children of the light;
We shall soon obtain the grace,
Pure in heart, to see his face.
Alleluia!
We shall gain our calling's prize;
After God we all shall rise,
Filled with joy, and love, and peace,
Perfected in holiness.
Alleluia!

Jesus comes with power to gladden, when love shines in,
Every life that woe can sadden, when love shines in.
Love will teach us how to pray, love will drive the gloom away,
Turn our darkness into day, when love shines in.

Jesus comes, He comes in glory,
Echoes through the ages hoary
Blessed hope and thrilling story,
Hallelujah! Jesus comes!

Jesus, from thy throne on high,
far above the bright blue sky,
look on us with loving eye:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Little hearts may love thee well,
little lips thy love may tell,
little hymns thy praises swell:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Little deeds of love may shine,
little lives may be divine,
little ones be wholly thine:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Be thou with us every day,
in our work and in our play,
when we learn and when we pray:
hear us, holy Jesus.
May our thoughts be undefiled,
may our words be true and mild,
make us each a holy child:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Jesus, from thy heavenly throne,
watching o'er each little one,
till our life on earth in done:
hear us, holy Jesus.

Jesus, from whom all blessings flow,
Great Builder of Thy church below,
If now Thy Spirit moves my breast,
Hear, and fulfill Thine own request!

Hey, Lord
Don't you know that my

Jesus, gentlest Savior,
God of might and power,
thou thyself art dwelling
in us at this hour.
Nature cannot hold thee,
heaven is all too strait
for thine endless glory
and thy royal state.
Out beyond the shining
of the furthest star
thou art ever stretching
infinitely far.
Yet the hearts of children
hold what worlds cannot,
and the God of wonders
loves the lowly spot.
Jesus, gentlest Savior,
dwelling in us now,
fill us full of goodness
till our hearts o'erflow.
Multiply our graces,
chiefly love and fear,
and, dear Lord, the chiefest,
grace to persevere.

Jesus, grant me this, I pray,
ever in thy heart to stay;
let me evermore abide
hidden in thy wounded side.
If the evil one prepare,
or the world, a tempting snare,
I am safe when I abide
in thy heart and wounded side.
If the flesh, more dangerous still,
tempt my soul to deeds of ill,
naught I fear when I abide
in thy heart and wounded side.
Death will come one day to me;
Jesus, cast me not from thee:
dying let me still abide
in thy heart and wounded side.

Jesus, Grant Us All A Blessing;
Send it down, Lord from above;
May we all go home a praising,
And rejoicing in thy love;
Farewell, brethren, farewell sisters,
Till we all shall meet again.
Jesus, pardon all our follies,
Since together we have been;
Make us humble, make us holy,
Cleanse us all from ev'ry sin;
Farewell, brethren, farewell sisters,
Till we all shall meet again.
May thy blessing, Lord, go with us,
To each one's respective home,
And the presence of our Jesus
Rest upon us ev'ry one;
Farewell, brethren, farewell sisters,
Till we all shall meet at home.

Jesus has a table spread
Where the saints of God are fed,
He invites His chosen people, “Come and dine";
With His manna He doth feed
And supplies our every need:
O ’tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!

Jesus has died that I might live,
Might live to God alone,
In him eternal life receive,
And be in spirit one.
Saviour, I thank thee for the grace,
The gift unspeakable!
And wait with arms of faith to embrace,
And all thy love to feel.
My soul breaks out in strong desire
The perfect bliss to prove;
My longing heart is all on fire
To be dissolved in love.
Give me thyself - from every boast,
From every wish set free,
Let all I am in thee be lost;
But give thyself to me.
Thy gifts, alone, cannot suffice
Unless thyself be given;
Thy presence makes my paradise,
And where thou art is heaven.

Out of the depths to the glory above,
I have been lifted in wonderful love;
From every fetter my spirit is free,
For Jesus has lifted me!

Jesus has loved me—wonderful Savior!
Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why;
Came He to rescue sinners all worthless,
My heart He conquered—for Him I would die.

Have you heard the joyful sound?
Jesus heals, Jesus heals;
Through the Spirit we have found
Jesus heals, Jesus heals.
Yes, He heals the blind and lame,
And His pow’r is just the same
As when first to earth He came,
Jesus heals, Jesus heals.

Savior, bless a little child;
Teach my heart the way to Thee;
Make it gentle, good and mild;
Loving Savior, care for me.

Jesus hears me when I pray,
He will never turn away;
He will listen to my call,
For He loves the children all.

Jesus, help me, I am weary,
Let me hold Thy hand in mine;
For the stream of living water,
In a thirsty land I pine;
O my Father, do not leave me,
In this dark and dreadful hour,
Fold me in Thy arms of mercy,
Keep me from the tempter’s pow’r.

Jesus, high in glory,
Lend a listening ear;
When we bow before Thee,
Children’s praises hear.

Jesus, holy, undefiled,
Listen to a little child;
Thou hast sent the glorious light,
Chasing far the silent night.

Jesus, hope of every nation,
light of heaven upon our way;
promise of the world's salvation,
spring of life's eternal day!
Saints by faith on God depending
wait to see Messiah born;
sin's oppressive night is ending
in the glory of the dawn!
Look, he comes! the long - awaited
Christ, redeemer, living Word;
hope and faith are vindicated
as with joy we greet the Lord.
Glory in the highest heaven
to the Father, Spirit, Son,
on the earth all praise be given
to our God, the Three - in - One!

Jesus I will never leave,
Who for me Himself hath given;
Firmly unto Him I'll cleave
Nor from Him be ever driven.
Life from Him doth light receive,--
Jesus I will never leave.

Jesus, if still that same thou art,
If all thy promises are sure,
Set up thy kingdom in my heart,
And make me rich, for I am poor,
To me be all thy treasures given,
The kingdom of an inward heaven.
Thou hast pronounced the mourners blest;
And lo, for thee I ever mourn:
I cannot - no, I will not rest,
Till thou, my only rest, return;
Till thou, the Prince of Peace, appear,
And I receive the Comforter.
Where is the blessedness bestowed
On all that hunger after thee?
I hunger now, I thirst for God;
See the poor fainting sinner, see,
And satisfy with endless peace,
And fill me with thy righteousness.
Shine on thy work, disperse the gloom,
Light in thy light I then shall see;
Say to my soul: 'Thy light is come,
Glory divine is risen on thee,
Thy warfare's past, thy mourning's o'er;

He's in the neighborhood
Neighborhood

My country 'tis of thee
My Jesus can't you see I'm blue (hey, hey, hey)
Well I went up to San Diego, L.A.
On up to the tip top of Seattle in the trees and the rain
California, Oregon, and Washington
Beauty that surrounds you is clear, clean and clear
But they've even got troubles
In the Evergreen State
People crying
 "Lord have mercy get me out of here"

Jesus invites His saints
To meet around His board;
Here pardoned rebels sit and hold
Communion with their Lord.

Jesus Is All I Wish or Want
For Him I pray, for Him I pant;
Let others after earth aspire,
Christ is the treasure I desire.
Possessed of Him, I ask no more;
He is an all-sufficient store;
To praise Him all my powers conspire 
Christ is the treasure I desire.
If He His smiling face but hide,
My soul no comfort has beside;
Distressed I after Him inquire 
Christ is the treasure I desire.
And while my heart is racked with pain,
Jesus appears and smiles again.
Why should my Savior thus retire?
Christ is the treasure I desire.
Come, humble souls, and view His charms,
Take refuge in His saving arms,
And sing, while you his worth admire,
"Christ is the Savior I desire."

Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all;
He is my strength from day to day, without Him I would fall.
When I am sad, to Him I go, no other one can cheer me so;
When I am sad, He makes me glad, He’s my Friend.

Jesus is calling! Forth to the fray,
In line be falling, serve Him today;
Follow Him ever, call no retreat,
His soldiers never suffer defeat.

Drifting away from the peaceful fold,
Drifting far out in the storm and cold;
Sinner, oh, turn from your dreadful plight,
Jesus is calling for thee tonight.

Jesus is calling His people again,
Back to the glorified heavenly plain,
Home to the city of purity bright,
Out from sin Babel’s confusion and night.

Jesus is calling the children,
Calling, yes, calling today;
Oh, will you walk in His footsteps—
Walk in the beautiful way.

Jesus is coming! O sing the glad word!
Coming for those He redeemed by His blood,
Coming to reign as the glorified Lord!
Jesus is coming again!

Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring:
Jesus is coming again!
Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing:
Jesus is coming again!

Jesus is coming to earth again; what if it were today?
Coming in power and love to reign; what if it were today?
Coming to claim His chosen Bride, all the redeemed and 
purified,
Over this whole earth scattered wide; what if it were today?

Jesus is God! The solid earth,
The ocean broad and bright,
The countless stars like golden dust,
That strew the sky at night,
The wheeling storm, the dreadful fire,
The pleasant wholesome air,
The summer’s sun, the winter’s frost,
His own creation were.

Jesus has been so good to me,
No other friend so kind could be;
Safely keeps me every day
Free from sin and in the way;
Ne’er can I such love repay,
He’s so good to me.

Jesus is just alright with me (Jesus)
Jesus is just alright, oh yah (woh Jesus)
Jesus is just alright with me (Jesus)
Jesus is just alright

Father
Help Your children
And don't let them fall
By the side of the road, mmm.mmm.
And teach them
To love one another
That Heaven might find
A place in their hearts
'Cause Jesus is love
He won't let you down
And I know He's mine forever
Oh, in my heart
We've got to walk on
Walk on through temptation
'Cause His love and His wisdom
Will be our helpin' hand
And I know the Truth
And His words will be our salvation
Lift up our hearts
To be thankful and glad
That Jesus is love
He won't let you down
And I know He's mine
Deep down in my soul
Jesus is love
Oh, yes, He is
He won't let you down
And I know He's mine, He's mine, He's mine, He's mine, all mine
Forever, oh, in my heart
Help me, heart, heart
Ooh.ooh.
(Deep in my heart)
I know, I know, I know, I know
Ah, 'cause His love's the power (Power)
His love's the glory (Glory)
Forever (Ever and ever)
Ooh, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna follow your star
Wherever it leads me
And I don't mind, Lord
I hope you don't mind
I wanna walk with you
And talk with you
And do all the things you want me to do
'Cause I know that Jesus
(Jesus is Love, I know) 'Cause I know, Lord
(And if you ask, I'll show)
(Love is the word forever) And ever and ever
Who can bring you love (Jesus)
Who can bring you joy (Jesus)
Who can turn your life around (Jesus), oh
Ooh, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Hey

Fade, fade, each earthly joy, Jesus is mine!
Break every tender tie, Jesus is mine!
Dark is the wilderness, Earth has no resting place,
Jesus alone can bless, Jesus is mine!

Jesus is my best of friends,
None like Him ’mongst mortals born;
And shall I whom He defends,
Join the world, His goodness scorn?
Naught shall raise a parting line
To hold me from His tend’rest love;
One shall be His will and mine
Lifelong here, for aye above.

Jesus is my Shepherd, so kind and true,
Down where the living waters flow;
He calls for His own, He keepeth the “few,"
Where pastures of green ever grow.

Jesus is our loving Savior,
He, our best, our constant Friend;
In His service life is pleasure,
For He loveth to the end.
Loving Savior, loving Savior,
Here we at Thy footstool bend,
Here we at Thy footstool bend.

Is there a heart that is waiting,
Longing for pardon today?
Hear the glad message proclaiming,
Jesus is passing this way.

Hear the gentle Spirit’s call,
Jesus is pleading for thee;
There is pardon free for all,
Jesus is pleading for thee.

Jesus is pleading with my poor soul, shall I be saved 
tonight?
If I believe, He will make me whole, shall I be saved 
tonight?
Tenderly, sadly, I hear Him say, “How can you grieve me 
from day to day?"
Shall I go on in the old, old way, or shall I be saved 
tonight?

Jesus is standing in Pilate's hall,
friendless, forsaken, betrayed by all;
hearken! what meaneth the sudden call?
What will you do with Jesus?

Jesus is tenderly calling you home
Calling today, calling today,
Why from the sunshine of love will you roam,
Farther and farther away?

Jesus is the Answer for the World Today
Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way
Jesus is the Answer for the World Today
Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way

Bring the children all to Jesus,
For he is their dearest friend;
Having loved His precious jewels,
He will love them to the end.

When the sun shines bright and your heart is light,
Jesus is the Friend you need;
When the clouds hang low in this world of woe,
Jesus is the Friend you need.

Jesus is the one who saved my soul
He came to make a world of sinners whole (He came to make a world of 
sinners whole, sinners whole)
So if you are searching for a Savior, too (so if you are searching for Him 
too, Him too remember)
Remember Jesus gave Himself for yoh

There have been names that I have loved to hear,
But never has there been a name so dear
To this heart of mine, as the Name divine,
The precious, precious Name of Jesus.

I had a dream I was walkin' with Saul (walkin', talkin')
The Chrisitans he was chasing, he was killing them all
Falling to his knees, it was God that he saw

You can buy a ticket to Paris
You can buy a ticket to Rome
You can buy a ticket to Sweeden
But you can't buy a ticket for that heavenly home

Jesus, Jesus, full of all compassion,
Hear Thy humble suppliant’s cry;
Let me know Thy great salvation,
See, I languish, faint and die.

Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!
Sing aloud the Name;
Till it softly, slowly,
Sets all hearts aflame.

In your pathway have you found some cruel thorns?
Jesus bore them on His brow, and He knows;
Does the world look down upon you with its frown?
All the world forsook your Lord, and He knows.

Jesus, Lamb of God, for me
Thou, the Lord of life, didst die;
Whither—whither, but to Thee,
Can a trembling sinner fly?
Death’s dark waters o’er me roll,
Save, O save, my sinking soul.

This is my 
cry;   this is my song.

Jesus, lead Thou on
Till our rest is won;
And although the way be cheerless,
We will follow calm and fearless.
Guide us by Thy hand
To our fatherland.

Like a shepherd, tender, true,
Jesus leads, Jesus leads,
Daily finds us pastures new,
Jesus leads, Jesus leads;
If thick mists are o’er the way,
Or the flock ’mid danger feeds,
He will watch them lest they stray,
Jesus leads, Jesus leads.

Jesus, let all Thy lovers shine,
Illustrious as the sun;
And, bright with borrowed rays divine,
Their glorious circuit run.

Jesus lives! no longer now
Can thy terrors, death, appall us;
Jesus lives! by this we know
Thou, O grave, canst not enthrall us.
Alleluia!

Jesus lives! From riven tomb
He arose, triumphant, glorious!
Now hath He indeed become
By His death for aye victorious,
Lightnings flash, the earth is heaving;
Rent the grave! The Lord is living!

Jesus, Lord of life and glory,
bend from heaven thy gracious ear;
while our waiting souls adore thee,
friend of helpless sinners, hear.

Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high.
Hide me, O my Savior, hide, till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide; O receive my soul at last.

I 
am so glad that our Father in Heav’n
Tells of His love in the Book He has giv’n;
Wonderful things in the Bible I see,
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

Jesus loves me! This I know,
For the Bible tells me so.
Little ones to Him belong;
They are weak, but He is strong.

Little children, do not fear, Jesus loves you,
How He loves you, how He loves you;
He will fill your hearts with cheer, He will guide you,
Where we’ll never die.

I hear celestial music strains
Resounding everywhere;
Their tidings fill Judea’s plains,
That Christ our sins did bear.
Yes, yes, yes, my heart from sin is freed,
Yes, free indeed.

Jesus makes my heart rejoice,
I’m His sheep, and know His voice;
He’s a Shepherd, kind and gracious,
And His pastures are delicious;
Constant love to me He shows,
Yea, my very name He knows.

Jesus, Master, whom I serve,
though so feebly and so ill,
strengthen hand and heart and nerve
all thy bidding to fulfill;
open thou mine eyes to see
all the work thou hast done for me.
Lord, thou needest not, I know,
service such as I can bring;
yet I long to prove and show
full allegiance to my King.
Thou Redeemer art to me;
let me be a praise to thee.
Jesus, Master, wilt thou use
one who owes thee more than all?
As thou wilt! I would not choose;
only let me hear thy call.
Jesus! let me always be
in thy service glad and free.

Jesus, my Savior, I love and adore Thee,
Jesus my all in all;
Nothing on earth would I worship before Thee,
Jesus my all in all.

Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside.
His powerful blood did once atone,
And now it pleads before the throne.

Jesus, O precious Name,
By Heaven’s herald spoken,
Jesus, O holy Name,
Of love divine the token.
Jesus, in Thy dear Name
This new year we begin;
Bless Thou its opening door,
Inscribe Thy Name within.

What 
means 
this 
eager, 
anxious 
throng,
Which 
moves 
with 
busy 
haste 
along—
These 
wondrous 
gath’rings 
day by 
day,
What 
means 
this 
strange 
commotion, 
pray?
In 
accents 
hushed 
the 
throng 
reply,
 “Jesus 
of 
Nazareth 
passeth 
by."
In 
accents

What 
tho’ 
clouds 
are 
hov’ring 
o’er 
me,
And 
I 
seem 
to 
walk 
alone—
Longing 
’mid 
my 
cares 
and 
crosses,
For 
the 
joys 
that 
now 
are 
flown—
If 
I’ve 
Jesus, 
“Jesus 
only,"
Then 
my 
sky 
will 
have 
a 
gem;
He’s 
a 
Sun 
of 
brightest 
splendor,
And 
the 
Star 
of 
Bethlehem.

Jesus 
only 
is 
our 
message,
Jesus 
all 
our 
theme 
shall 
be;
We 
will

up 
Jesus

Jesus 
only

For salvation full and free,
Purchased once on Calvary,
Christ alone shall be my plea—
Jesus! Jesus only.

Jesus Christ the Lord opened up the way to glory
When He died to save us from our ruined state,
And He asks that we shall go tell the world the story,
How His blood will save them from their awful fate.

O! come and mourn with me awhile,
See, Mary calls us to her side;
Oh! come and let us mourn with her,
Jesus, our Love, is crucified.

Jesus, Our Savior and Our God
Arrayed in majesty and blood;
Thou art our life; our souls in thee
Posses a full felicity.
All our immortal hopes are laid
In thee, our Surety and our Head;
Thy cross, thy cradle, and thy throne,
Are big with glories yet unknown.
Let atheists scoff and Jews blaspheme
Th'eternal life and Jesus' name;
A word of thy almighty breath
Dooms the rebellious world to death.
But let my soul forever lie
Beneath the blessings of thine eye;
'Tis heav'n on earth, 'tus heav'n above.
To see thy face and taste thy love.

I hear the Savior say,
“Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

When Jesus no longer stands preciously nigh,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
I look to the Rock that is higher than I,
And peace, wondrous peace floods my soul.

We have heard the joyful sound: Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around: Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to every land, climb the mountains, cross the waves;
Onward! ’tis our Lord’s command; Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Jesus, Saviour ever mild,
Born for us a little child
Of the Virgin undefilied:
Hear us, holy Jesus.
Jesus, Son of God most high,
Who didst in the manger lie,
Who upon the cross didst die,
Hear us, holy Jesus.
From all pride and vain conceit,
From all spite and angry heat,
From all lying and deceit,
Save us, holy Jesus.
From refusing to obey,
From the love of our own way,
From forgetfulness to pray,
Save us, holy Jesus.
By the name we bow before,
Human name, which evermore
All the hosts of heaven adore,
Save us, holy Jesus.

Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

Jesus sinners doth receive;
Oh, may all this saying ponder
Who in sin’s delusions live
And from God and Heaven wander!
Here is hope for all who grieve—
Jesus sinners doth receive.

Jesus, Sun of righteousness,
brightest beam of love divine,
with the early morning rays
do thou on our darkness shine,
and dispel with purest light
all our night.
As on drooping herb and flower
falls the soft refreshing dew,
let thy Spirit's grace and power
all our weary souls renew;
showers of blessing over all
softly fall.
Like the sun's reviving ray,
may thy love with tender glow
all our coldness melt away,
warm and cheer us forth to go,
gladly serve thee and obey
all the day.
O our only Hope and Guide,
never leave us nor forsake;
keep us ever at thy side
till the eternal morning break;
moving on to Zion's hill,
homeward still.
Lead us all our days and years
in thy straight and narrow way;
lead us through the vale of tears
to the land of perfect day,
where thy people, fully blest,
safely rest.

Jesus spreads his banner o’er us,
Cheers our famished souls with food;
He the banquet spreads before us,
Of His mystic flesh and blood.
Precious banquet, bread of heaven,
Wine of gladness, flowing free;
May we taste it, kindly given,
In remembrance, Lord, of Thee.

Jesus, stand among us 
at the meeting of our lives,
Be our sweet agreement at the meeting of our eyes;
O, Jesus, we love You, so we gather here,
Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
So to You we're gathering out of each and every land,
Christ the love between us at the joining of our hands;
O, Jesus, we love You, so we gather here,
Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
Lead us, heavenly father
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
O'er the world's tempestuous sea;
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but thee;
Yet possessing every blessing,
If our God our Father be.
Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us:
All our weakness thou dost know;
Thou didst tread this earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
Through the desert thou didst go.
Spirit of our God, descending,
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy,
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cloy:
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy.

Jesus, sun and shield art thou,
Sun and shield for ever!
Never canst thou cease to shine,
Cease to guard us, never.
Cheer our steps as on we go,
Come between us and the foe.
Jesus, peace and joy art thou,
Joy and peace for ever!
Joy that fades not, changest not,
Peace that leaves us never.
Joy and peace we have in thee,
Now and through eternity.
Jesus, song and strength art thou,
Strength and song for ever!
Strength that never can decay,
Song that ceaseth never.
Still to us this strength and song
Through eternal days prolong.
Jesus, bread and wine art thou,
Wine and bread for ever!
Never canst thou cease to feed,
Or refresh us, never.
Feed we still on bread divine,
Drink we still of heavenly wine.

Jesus, the Crucified, pleads for me,
while he is nailed to the shameful tree,
scorned and forsaken, derided and cursed,
see how his enemies do their worst!
Yet, in the midst of the torture and shame,
Jesus, the Crucified, breathes my name:
wonder of wonders, oh, can it be?
Jesus, the Crucified, pleads for me!
Lord, I have left thee, I have denied,
followed the world in my selfish pride;
Lord, I have joined in the hateful cry,
slay him, away with him, crucify!
Lord, I have done it, oh! ask me not how;
woven the thorns for thy tortured brow;
yet in his pity, so boundless and free,
Jesus, the Crucified, pleads for me!
"Though thou hast left me and wandered away,
chosen the darkness instead of the day;
though thou art covered with many a stain,
though thou hast wounded me oft and again;
though thou hast followed thy wayward will;
yet, in my pity, I love thee still."
Wonder of wonders it ever must be!
Jesus, the Crucified, pleads for me!
Jesus is dying, in agony sore,
Jesus is suffering more and more,
Jesus is bowed with the weight of his woe,
Jesus is faint with each bitter throe.
Jesus is bearing it all in my stead,
pity incarnate for me has bled;
wonder of wonders it ever must be!
Jesus, the Crucified, pleads for me!

Jesus, the Father's only Son,
whose death for all redemption won;
before the worlds, of God most high
begotten all ineffably.
The Father's light and splendor thou,
their endless hope to thee that bow;
accept the prayers and praise today
that through the world thy servants pay.
Salvation's author, call to mind
how, taking form of humankind,
born of a Virgin undefiled,
thou in a man's flesh becam'st a child.
Thus testifies the present day,
through every year in long array,
that thou, salvation's source alone,
proceedest from the Father's throne.
Whence sky, and stars, and sea's abyss,
and earth, and all that therein is,
shall still, with laud and carol meet,
the Author of thine advent greet.
And we who, by thy precious blood
from sin redeemed, are marked for God,
on this the day that saw thy birth,
sing the new song of ransomed earth:
for that thine advent glory be,
O Jesus, Virgin-born, to thee;
with Father, and with Holy Ghost,
from men and from the heavenly host.

Jesus, the gift divine I know,
The gift divine I ask of thee;
That living water now bestow -
Thy Spirit and thyself, on me;
Thou, Lord, of life the fountain art;
Now let me find thee in my heart.
Thee let me drink, and thirst no more
For drops of finite happiness;
Spring up, O well, in heavenly power,
In streams of pure perennial peace,
In joy that none can take away,
In life which shall for ever stay.
Father, on me the grace bestow,
Unblamable before thy sight,
Whence all the streams of mercy flow;
Mercy, thy own supreme delight,
To me, for Jesu's sake, impart,
And plant thy nature in my heart.
Thy mind throughout my life be shown,
While, listening to the sufferer's cry,
The widow's and the orphan's groan,
On mercy's wings I swiftly fly,
The poor and helpless to relieve,
My life, my all, for them to give.
Thus may I show the Spir't within,
Which purges me from every stain;
Unspotted from the world and sin,
My faith's integrity maintain;
The truth of my religion prove
By perfect purity and love.

Jesus the good Shepherd is,
Jesus died the sheep to save;
He is mine and I am his,
All I want in him I have;
Life, and health, and rest, and food,
All the plenitude of God.
Jesus loves and guards his own;
Me in verdant pastures feeds,
Makes me quietly lie down,
By the streams of comfort leads:
Following him where'er he goes,
Silent joy my heart o'erflows.
He in sickness makes me whole,
Guides into the paths of peace;
He revives my fainting soul,
Stablishes in righteousness;
Who for me vouchsafed to die,
Loves me still - I know not why!
Love divine shall still embrace,
Love shall keep me to the end;
Surely all my happy days
I shall in thy temple spend,
Till I to thy house remove,
Thy eternal house above!

Jesus the Lord laid His glory aside,
Sinners to save and make whole,
Freely He died our transgressions to 
hide,
What is He worth to your soul?

Jesus! the Name high over all,
In hell or earth or sky;
Angels and men before it fall,
And devils fear and fly.

Do you know Jesus,
Our Lord, our Savior,
Jesus the Son of God?
Have you ever seen Him,
Or shared of His favor?
Jesus the Son of God.

Jesus! the very thought is sweet;
in that dear name all heart-joys meet;
but O, than honey sweeter far
the glimpses of his presence are.
No word is sung more sweet than this,
no sound is heard more full of bliss,
no thought brings sweeter comfort nigh,
than Jesus, Son of God most high.
Jesus, the hope of souls forlorn,
how good to them for sin that mourn!
To them that seek the, O how kind!
But what art thou to them that find?
No tongue of mortal can express,
no pen can write, the blessedness:
he only who hath proved it knows
what bliss from love of Jesus flows.
O Jesus, King of wondrous might!
O Victor, glorious from the fight!
Sweetness that may not be expressed,
and altogether loveliest!
Abide with us, O Lord, today,
fulfill us with thy grace, we pray;
and with thine own true sweetness feed
our souls from sin and darkness freed.

Jesus, the virgins' crown, do thou
accept us as in prayer we bow;
born of that Virgin whom alone
the Mother and the Maid we own.
Amongst the lilies thou dost feed,
with virgin choirs accompanied--
with glory decked, the spotless brides
whose bridal gifts thy love provides.
They, wheresoe'er thy footsteps bend,
with hymns and prayers still attend;
in blessed troops they follow thee,
with dance, and song, and melody.
We pray thee therefore to bestow
upon our senses here below
thy grace, that so we may endure
from taint of all corruption pure.
All laud to God the Father be,
all praise, eternal Son, to thee;
all glory, as is ever meet,
to God the holy Paraclete.

Jesus the water of life will give,
Freely, freely, freely;
Jesus the water of life will give,
Freely to those who love Him.
Come to that fountain, oh drink, and 
live!
Freely, freely, freely;
Come to that fountain, oh, drink and 
live!
Flowing for those that love Him.

Jesus, thou hast willed it,
that thy Church should be
one in faith and spirit,
ever one in thee.
We the cross are bearing,
once on Jesus laid;
we the prayer are praying
that our Master prayed.

Jesus, thy far-extended fame
My drooping soul exults to hear;
Thy name, thy all-restoring name,
Is music in a sinner's ear.
Sinners of old thou didst receive
With comfortable words and kind,
Their sorrows cheer, their wants relieve,
Heal the diseased, and cure the blind.
And art thou not the Saviour still,
In every place and age the same?
Hast thou forgot thy gracious skill,
Or lost the virtue of thy name?
Faith in thy changeless name I have;
The good, the kind physician, thou
Art able now our souls to save,
Art willing to restore them now.
Wouldst thou the body's health restore,
And not regard the sin-sick soul?
The soul thou lovest yet the more,
And surely thou shalt make it whole.
My soul's disease, my every sin,
To thee, O Jesus, I confess;
In pardon, Lord, my cure begin,
And perfect it in holiness.

Jesus, thy mercies are untold
through each returning day;
thy love exceeds a thousandfold
whatever we can say;
that love which in thy passion drained
for us thy precious Blood;
that love whereby the saints have gained
the vision of their God;
'tis thou hast loved us from the womb,
pure source of all our bliss,
our only hope of life to come,
our happiness in this;
Lord, grant us, while on earth we stay,
thy love to feel and know;
and, when from hence we pass away,
to us thy glory show.

Jesus, thy wandering sheep behold!
See, Lord, with tenderest pity see
The sheep that cannot find the fold,
Till sought and gathered in by thee.
Lost are they now, and scattered wide,
In pain, and weariness, and want;
With no kind shepherd near to guide
The sick, and spiritless, and faint.
Thou, only thou, the kind and good
And sheep-redeeming Shepherd art:
Collect thy flock, and give them food,
And pastors after thine own heart.
Give the pure word of general grace,
And great shall be the preachers' crowd;
Preachers, who all the sinful race
Point to the all-atoning blood.
Open their mouth, and utterance give;
Give them a trumpet-voice, to call
On all the world to turn and live,
Through faith in him who died for all.
Thy only glory let them seek;
O let their hearts with love o'erflow!
Let them believe, and therefore speak,
And spread thy mercy's praise below.
Mercy for all be all their song,
Mercy which every soul may claim,
Mercy which doth to all belong,
Mercy for all in Jesu's name.

Jesus, to thy table led,
now let every heart be fed
with the true and living Bread.
While in penitence we kneel
thy sweet presence let us feel,
all thy wondrous love reveal.
When we taste the mystic wine,
of thine outpoured Blood the sign,
fill our hearts with love divine.
Draw us to thy wounded side,
whence there flowed the healing tide;
there our sins and sorrows hide.
From the bonds of sin release,
cold and wavering faith increase,
Lamb of God, grant us thy peace.
Lead us by thy pierced hand
till around thy throne we stand
in the bright and better land.

Jesus touch my heart
Heal and make me whole again
Jesus touch my heart
Help me see my goal again
My impurities bring me to my knees
Jesus always sees my needs

Bowed beneath your burden, is 
there none to share?
Weary with the journey, is there 
none to care?
Courage, wayworn traveler, heed 
your Lord’s

Jesus waits to welcome you,
Will you come? Will you come?
Arms of love outstretched to you,
Will you come? Will you come?

Once Jesus was a child like me,
But O, so kind and true;
His ever watchful eye can see
The very things I do.

Jesus, we follow thee,
In all thy footsteps tread,
And seek for full conformity
To our exalted Head.
We would, we would partake
Thy every state below,
And suffer all things for thy sake,
And to thy glory go.
We in thy birth are born,
Sustain thy grief and loss,
Share in thy want, and shame, and scorn,
And die upon thy cross.
Baptised into thy death,
We sink into thy grave,
Till thou the quickening Spirit breathe,
And to the utmost save.
Thou saidst, 'Where'er I am,
There shall my servants be.'
Master, thy welcome word we claim,
And die to live with thee.
To us who share thy pain,
Thy joy shall soon be given,
And we shall in thy glory reign,
For thou art now in heaven.

Jesus, we just want to thank You,
Jesus, we just want to thank You,
Jesus, we just want to thank You,
Thank You for being so good.
Jesus, we just want to praise You,
Jesus, we just want to praise You,
Jesus, we just want to praise You,
Praise You for being so good.
Savior, we just want to serve You,
Savior, we just want to serve You,
Savior, we just want to serve You,
Serve You for being so good.
Jesus, we know You are coming,
Jesus, we know You are coming,
Jesus, we know You are coming,
Take us to live in Your home.

Jesus, we thus obey
thy last and kindest word;
here in thine own appointed way
we come to meet thee, Lord.
Our hearts we open wide
to make the Saviour room;
and lo, the Lamb, the Crucified,
the sinner's friend, is come.
Thy presence makes the feast;
now let our spirits feel
thy glory not to be expressed,
the joy unspeakable.
With high and heavenly bliss
thou dost our spirits cheer;
thy house of banqueting is this
and thou hast brought us here.
Now let our souls be fed
with manna from above,
and over us thy banner spread
of everlasting love.

Jesus wept! those tears 
are over,
But His heart is still 
the same;
Kinsman, Friend, and 
elder Brother,
Is His everlasting Name.
Savior, who can love 
like Thee,
Gracious One of Bethany?

Trouble in my way (Trouble in my way)
Have to cry sometime (I Have to cry sometime)
Trouble in my way (Trouble in my way)
Have to cry sometime (I Have to cry sometime)
Lay awake at night (Lay awake at night)
But that's all right (That's all right)

Come to the 
Father’s house,
Come ere the day 
be gone;
Tempests are 
gath’ring fast,
Darkness is 
coming on.

Jesus will save, for your soul He hath given
His precious life as a ransom from sin,
That He might open an entrance to heaven,
And for you life everlasting to win.

Hear ye the moan of a soul that is lost,
O wretched sinner, that spirit is thine;
Jesus will enter thy bosom today,
Turning thy darkness to glory divine.

Over the river 
they call me,
Friends that 
are dear to my 
heart;
Soon shall I 
meet them in 
glory,
Never, no 
never to part.

Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!
Sing aloud the Name;
Till it softly, slowly,
Sets all hearts aflame.

Jesus! the Name high over all,
In hell or earth or sky;
Angels and men before it fall,
And devils fear and fly.

Jesus! dear Name, how sweet it sounds!
Replete with balm for all our wounds:
His Word declares His grace is free,
Come, needy sinner, “Come and see."

Jesus, faithful to His Word, shall with a shout descend;
All Heaven’s host their glorious Lord shall pompously attend:
Christ shall come with dreadful noise, lightnings swift, and thunders loud;
With the great archangel’s voice, and with the trump of God.

Jesus, Friend of sinners, hast Thou love for me?
Son of God the Holy, Man of mystery,
Lover of the children, Teacher of the wise,
Let me read the secret in Thy friendly eyes.

Jesus, full of love divine,
I am Thine and Thou art mine;
Let me live and die to prove
Thine unutterable love.
More and more of love I claim,
Glowing still with quenchless flame;
All my heart to Thee aspires,
Yearns with infinite desire.

Jesus, good above all other,
Gentle Child of gentle mother,
In a stable born our Brother,
Give us grace to persevere.

Jesus, grant that balm and healing
In Thy holy wounds I find,
Every hour that I am feeling,
Pains of body and of mind.
Should some evil thought within
Tempt my treacherous heart to sin,
Show the peril, and from sinning
Keep me ere its first beginning.

Jesus, I am coming home today, for
I have found there’s joy in Thee alone;
From the path of sin I turn away; now
I am coming home.

Jesus, I am resting, resting,
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
And Thy beauty fills my soul,
For by Thy transforming power,
Thou hast made me whole.

Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light,
Jesus, I come to Thee;
Out of my sickness, into Thy health,
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into Thyself,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

Jesus, I love Thy charming Name,
’Tis music to mine ear;
Fain would I sound it out so loud
That earth and Heaven should hear.

Jesus, I my cross have taken, all to leave and follow Thee.
Destitute, despised, forsaken, Thou from hence my all shall be.
Perish every fond ambition, all I’ve sought or hoped or known.
Yet how rich is my condition! God and heaven are still mine own.

Jesus, I will ponder now
On Your holy Passion;
Let Your Spirit now endow
Me for meditation.
Grant that I in love and faith
May the image cherish
Of Your suffering, pain and death
That I may not perish.

Jesus, I will trust Thee, trust Thee with my soul;
Guilty, lost, and helpless, Thou canst make me whole.
There is none in Heaven or on earth like Thee:
Thou hast died for sinners—therefore Lord for me.

I have made my choice forever; I will walk with Christ my Lord.
Naught from Him my soul can sever while I'm trusting in His Word.
I the lonely ways have taken, rough and toilsome though it be;
And although despised, forsaken, Jesus I'll go through with Thee.

Jesus, immortal King, arise!
Assume, assert Thy sway,
Till earth, subdued, its tribute brings,
And distant lands obey.

Jesus, in sickness and in pain,
Be near to succor me,
My sinking spirit still sustain;
To Thee I turn, to Thee.

Jesus, in Thee our eyes behold
A thousand glories more,
Than the rich gems and polished gold
The sons of Aaron wore.

Jesus, in Thy dying woes,
Even while Thy lifeblood floes,
Craving pardon for Thy foes;
Hear us, holy Jesus.

Jesus invites His saints
To meet around His board;
Here pardoned rebels sit and hold
Communion with their Lord.

Freedom gain from sin’s control?
Jesus can redeem your soul—
Jesus, Jesus only.

Jesus, Jesus, only Jesus,
Can my heartfelt longing still.
Lo, I pledge myself to Jesus
What He wills alone to will.
For my heart, which He hath filled,
Ever cries, Lord, as Thou wilt.

Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all, a healing stream
Flows from Calvary’s mountain.

Jesus, King of glory, throned above the sky,
Jesus, tender Savior, hear Thy children cry.
Pardon our transgressions, cleanse from our sin,
By Thy Spirit help us heav’nly life to win.

Jesus, lead me up the mountain,
Where the whitest robes are seen,
Where the saints can see the fountain,
Where the pure are keeping clean.

Jesus, Lord and precious Savior,
All my comfort and my joy!
Graciously extend Thy favor,
Let Thy Word my soul employ.

Jesu, Lord of our salvation,
For Thy warrior, bold and true,
Now accept our thankful praises,
And our strength do Thou renew,
That, like George, with courage dauntless
We may all our foes subdue.

Jesus, Lord, we look to Thee;
Let us in Thy Name agree;
Show Thyself the Prince of Peace,
Bid our strife forever cease.

Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high.
Hide me, O my Savior, hide, till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide; O receive my soul at last.

Jesus, Master, Whose I am,
Purchased Thine alone to be,
By Thy blood, O spotless Lamb,
Shed so willingly for me,
Let my heart be all Thine own,
Let me live for Thee alone.

Jesus, meek and gentle,
Son of God most high,
Gracious, loving Savior,
Hear Thy children’s cry.

Jesus, meek and lowly, 
Savior, pure and holy,
on thy love relying
hear me humbly crying.
Prince of life and power,
my salvation's tower,
on the cross I view thee
calling sinners to thee.
There behold me gazing
at the sight amazing;
bending low before thee,
helpless I adore thee.
By thy red wounds streaming,
with thy life-blood gleaming,
blood for sinners flowing,
pardon free bestowing;
by that fount of blessing,
thy dear love expressing,
all my aching sadness
turn thou into gladness.
Lord, in mercy guide me,
be thou e'er beside me;
in thy ways direct me,
'neath thy wings protect me.

Jesus, merciful and mild, lead 
me as a helpless child:
On no other arm but Thine 
would my weary soul recline.
Thou art ready to forgive, 
Thou canst bid the sinner 
live;
Guide the wanderer, day by 
day, in the straight and 
narrow way.

Jesus, my Advocate above,
My Friend before the throne 
of love,
If now for me prevails Thy 
prayer,
If now I find Thee pleading 
there,
If Thou the secret wish 
convey,
And sweetly prompt my heart 
to pray;
Hear, and my weak petitions 
join,
Almighty Advocate, to Thine.

Jesus, my Savior, I love and adore Thee,
Jesus my all in all;
Nothing on earth would I worship before Thee,
Jesus my all in all.

Jesus, my all, to 
Heaven is gone,
He Whom I fix my hopes 
upon;
His track I see, and 
I’ll pursue
The narrow way, till 
Him I view.
The way the holy 
prophets went,
The road that leads 
from banishment,
The King’s highway of 
holiness,
I’ll go, for all His 
paths are peace.

I have a Friend so 
dear,
Constant and true is 
He,
Filling my heart with 
cheer,
So good to me.
He’s covered ev’ry sin 
and stain,
His pow’r now makes me 
whole again,
And soon with Him 
fore’er I’ll reign—
Jesus, my Friend.

Jesus, my King, my wonderful Savior,
All of my life is given to Thee.
I am rejoicing in Thy salvation;
Thy precious blood now maketh me free.

Jesus, my Lord, my 
God, my All,
Hear me, blest 
Savior, when I call;
Hear me, and from 
Thy dwelling place
Pour down the riches 
of Thy grace;
Jesus, my Lord, I 
Thee adore;
O make me love Thee 
more and more.

Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;
Unless Thou help me I must die;
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.

Jesus, my only 
Hope, Friend ever 
dear,
Bend to my earnest 
prayer Thy 
gracious ear;
Come from Thy 
throne above, come 
and my dross 
remove,
Fill me with 
perfect love, 
Savior, to Thee.

Jesus, my Savior, is precious to me,
He careth for me;
Loving and keeping me happy and free,
He careth for me.

Jesus, my 
Savior, let me 
be
More perfectly 
conformed to 
Thee;
Implant each 
grace, each sin 
dethrone,
And form my 
temper like 
Thine own.

Jesus, my 
Savior, 
look on 
me,
For I am 
weary and 
oppressed;
I come to 
cast 
myself on 
Thee:
Thou art 
my Rest.

Jesus, my Savior, to Bethlehem came,
Laid in a manger to sorrow and shame;
Oh, it was wonderful, blest be His Name,
Seeking for me, for me:
Seeking for me, seeking for me,
Seeking for me, seeking for me,
Oh, it was wonderful, blest be His Name,
Seeking for me, for me.

Jesus, my 
Strength, my 
Hope,
On Thee I 
cast my 
care,
With humble 
confidence 
look up,
And know 
Thou hear’st 
my prayer.
Give me on 
Thee to wait
Till I can 
all things 
do;
On Thee, 
almighty to 
create,
Almighty to 
renew.

My Lord, my Truth, my Way,

Jesus! 
Name of 
wondrous 
love!
Name all 
other 
names 
above!
Unto 
which 
must 
every 
knee
Bow in 
deep 
humility.

Jesus, Name all names above,
Jesus, best and dearest;
Jesus, Fount of perfect love,
holiest, tenderest, nearest:
Jesus, Source of grace completest;
Jesus purest, Jesus sweetest;
Jesus, Well of power divine,
make me, keep me, seal me thine!
Woe that I have turned aside
after fleshly pleasure!
Woe that I have never tried
for the heavenly treasure!
Treasure, safe in homes supernal,
incorruptible, eternal;
treasure no less price hath won
than the passion of the Son!
Jesus, crowned with thorns for me,
scourged for my transgression!
Witnessing, through agony,
that thy good confession!
Jesus, clad in purple raiment,
for my evils making payment:
let not all thy woe and pain,
let not Calvary be in vain!
Jesus, open me the gate
that of old he entered
who, in that most low estate,
wholly on thee ventured;
thou, whose wounds are ever pleading
and thy passion interceding,
from my misery let me rise
to a home in paradise!

Jesus, on the mountain peak,
stands alone in glory blazing;
let us, if we dare to speak,
with the saints and angels praise him.
Alleluia!
Trembling at his feet we saw
Moses and Elijah speaking.
All the prophets and the Law
shout through them their joyful greeting.
Alleluia!
Swift the cloud of glory came.
God proclaiming in its thunder
Jesus as the Son by name!
Nations, cry aloud in wonder!
Alleluia!
Jesus is the chosen One,
living hope of every nation.
Hear and heed him, everyone;
sing with earth and all creation:
Alleluia!

Jesus, our Brother, strong and good,
Was humbly born in a stable rude,
And the friendly beasts around Him stood,
Jesus, our Brother, strong and good.

Jesus, our hope, our heart's desire,
thy work of grace we sing;
Redeemer of the world art thou,
its Maker and its King.
How vast the mercy and the love
which laid our sins on thee,
and led thee to a cruel death,
to set thy people free!
But now the bonds of death are burst;
the ransom has been paid;
and thou art on thy Father's throne,
in glorious robes arrayed.
O may thy mighty love prevail
our sinful souls to spare!
O may we stand around thy throne,
and see thy glory there!
Jesus, our only joy be thou,
as thou our prize wilt be;
in thee be all our glory now
and through eternity.
All praise to thee who art gone up
triumphantly to heaven;
all praise to God the Father's Name
and Holy Ghost be given.

Jesus, priceless Treasure,
Source of purest pleasure,
Truest Friend to me.
Ah, how long in anguish
Shall my spirit languish,
Yearning, Lord, for Thee?
Thou art mine, O Lamb divine!
I will suffer naught to hide Thee,
Naught I ask beside Thee.

Jesus, Refuge of the weary,
Object of the spirit’s love,
Fountain in life’s desert dreary,
Savior from the world above.
O how oft Thine eyes, offended,
Gaze upon the sinner’s fall;
Yet upon the cross extended,
Thou didst bear the pain of all.

Jesus, Rose of Sharon, bloom within my heart;
Beauties of Thy truth and holiness impart,
That where’er I go my life may shed abroad
Fragrance of the knowledge of the love of God.

Jesus, Savior, come to me;
Let me ever be with Thee;
Come and nevermore depart,
Thou Who reignest in my heart.

Jesus, Savior, pilot me
Over life’s tempestuous sea;
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rock and treacherous shoal.
Chart and compass come from Thee;
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

Jesus, Savior, we implore Thee,
Hear Thy children now before Thee,
For Thy goodness we adore Thee,
Still our hearts in safety keep.
While Thy mercy we are pleading,
Thou in Heav’n art interceding;
Lead us where Thy flocks are feeding,
Gentle Shepherd, lead Thy sheep.

Jesus, Son of God most high,
who didst in a manger lie,
who upon the cross didst die:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Jesus, once an infant small, 
cradled in the oxen's stall,
though the God and Lord of all:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Be thou with us every day,
in our work and in our play,
when we learn and when we pray:
hear us, holy Jesus.
When we lie asleep at night,
ever may thy angels bright
keep us safe till morning light:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Make us brave without a fear,
make us happy, full of cheer,
sure that thou art always near:
hear us, holy Jesus.
May we prize our Christian name,
may we guard it free from blame,
hating all that causes shame:
hear us, holy Jesus.
May we grow from day to day,
glad to learn each holy way,
ever ready to obey:
hear us, holy Jesus.
May we ever try to be
from all angry tempers free,
pure and gentle, Lord, like thee:
hear us, holy Jesus.
May our thoughts be undefiled,
may our words be true and mild,
make us each a holy child:
hear us, holy Jesus.
Jesus, from thy heavenly throne,
watching o'er each little one,
till our life on earth in done:
hear us, holy Jesus.

Jesus, stand among us 
at the meeting of our lives,
Be our sweet agreement at the meeting of our eyes;
O, Jesus, we love You, so we gather here,
Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
So to You we're gathering out of each and every land,
Christ the love between us at the joining of our hands;
O, Jesus, we love You, so we gather here,
Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
Lead us, heavenly father
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
O'er the world's tempestuous sea;
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but thee;
Yet possessing every blessing,
If our God our Father be.
Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us:
All our weakness thou dost know;
Thou didst tread this earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
Through the desert thou didst go.
Spirit of our God, descending,
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy,
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cloy:
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy.

Jesus, still lead on, till our rest be won,
And, although the way be cheerless,
We will follow calm and fearless,
Guide us by Thy hand to our fatherland.

Jesus, Sun of righteousness,
brightest beam of love divine,
with the early morning rays
do thou on our darkness shine,
and dispel with purest light
all our night.
As on drooping herb and flower
falls the soft refreshing dew,
let thy Spirit's grace and power
all our weary souls renew;
showers of blessing over all
softly fall.
Like the sun's reviving ray,
may thy love with tender glow
all our coldness melt away,
warm and cheer us forth to go,
gladly serve thee and obey
all the day.
O our only Hope and Guide,
never leave us nor forsake;
keep us ever at thy side
till the eternal morning break;
moving on to Zion's hill,
homeward still.
Lead us all our days and years
in thy straight and narrow way;
lead us through the vale of tears
to the land of perfect day,
where thy people, fully blest,
safely rest.

Jesus, the all-restoring Word,
My fallen spirit’s hope,
After Thy lovely likeness, Lord,
Ah! when shall I wake up?

Jesus, the calm that fills my breast,
No other heart than Thine can give;
This peace unstirred, this joy of rest,
None but Thy loved ones can receive.

Jesus, the Conqueror, reigns,
In glorious strength arrayed,
His kingdom over all maintains,
And bids the earth be glad.
Ye sons of men, rejoice
In Jesus’ mighty love,
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice
To Him who rules above.

Jesus, the rising Lord of all,
His love to man commends,
Poor worms He blushes not to call
His brethren and His friends.

Jesus, the sinner’s Friend, to Thee,
Lost and undone, for aid I flee,
Weary of earth, myself, and sin:
Open Thine arms, and take me in.

Jesus, the Truth and Power divine,
Send forth these messengers of Thine;
Their hands confirm, their hearts inspire,
And touch their lips with hallowed fire.

Jesus, the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills the breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

Jesus, these eyes have never seen,
That radiant form of Thine;
The veil of sense hangs dark between
Thy blessed face and mine.

Jesus, Thine all victorious love
Shed in my heart abroad;
Then shall my feet no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God.

Jesus, Thou art mine forever,
Dearer far than earth to me;
Neither life nor death shall sever
Those sweet ties which bind to Thee.

Jesus, Thou art the sinner’s Friend;
As such I look to Thee;
Now, in the fullness of Thy love,
O Lord, remember me.

Jesus, Thou divine Companion,
By Thy lowly human birth
Thou hast come to join the workers,
Burden bearers of the earth.
Thou, the Carpenter of Nazareth,
Toiling for Thy daily food,
By Thy patience and Thy courage,
Thou hast taught us toil is good.

Jesus, Thou everlasting King,
Accept the tribute which we bring;
Accept the well deserved renown,
And wear our praises as Thy crown.

Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts,
Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men,
From the best bliss that earth imparts,
We turn unfilled to Thee again.

Jesus, Thou soul of all our joys,
For Whom we now lift up our voice,
And all our strength exert;
Vouchsafe the grace we humbly claim,
Compose into a thankful frame,
And tune Thy people’s heart.

Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness
My beauty are, my glorious dress;
’Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.

Jesus, Thy blood, Thy precious blood!
For sin it doth atone,
Because Thou art the Lamb of God,
It speaks before the throne.
Thy blood shall have its praises sung
By yonder white-robed throng;
All hail then to this precious blood,
I’ll shout in ceaseless song.

Jesus, Thy boundless love to me
No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
Unite my thankful heart with Thee
And reign without a rival there.
To Thee alone, dear Lord, I live;
Myself to Thee, dear Lord, I give.

Jesus, Thy Name hath pow’r to bless
Our troubled souls in all distress.
On us, dear Lord, bestow Thy grace,
And guide us safely all our days.

Jesus, Thy Name I love
All other names above,
Jesus, my Lord:
O Thou art all to me;
Nothing to please I see,
Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus, my Lord.

Jesus, to Thy table led,
Now let every heart be fed
With the true and living Bread.

Jesus, Thy church with longing eyes
For Thine expected coming waits:
When will the promised Light arise,
And glory beam from Zion’s gates?

Jesus, united by Thy grace,
And each to each endeared,
With confidence we seek Thy 
face
And know our prayer is heard.

Jesus, we look to Thee,
Thy promised presence 
claim;
Thou in the midst of us 
shall be,
Assembled in Thy Name.

Jesus! what a Friend for 
sinners!
Jesus! Lover of my soul;
Friends may fail me, 
foes assail me,
He, my Savior, makes me 
whole.

Jesus, where’er Thy 
people meet,
There they behold Thy 
mercy seat;
Where’er they seek 
Thee Thou art found,
And every place is 
hallowed ground.

Jesus, while our 
hearts are bleeding
O’er the spoils that 
death has won,
We would at this 
solemn meeting
Calmly say, “Thy 
will be done."

Jesus, Who bought us 
with His blood,
And makes our souls 
His care;
Was known of old as 
Israel’s God,
And answered Jabez’ 
prayer.

Jesus, Whose blood 
so freely streamed
To satisfy the 
law’s demand;
By Thee from guilt 
and wrath 
redeemed,
Before the 
Father’s face I 
stand.

Jesus, with Thy Church abide,
Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,
While on earth her faith is tried:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Oh, wonderful name, how my heart thrills to hear it—
The name of my risen Redeemer and King!
It falls like the music of Heav’n on my spirit,
And fills me with rapture divine while I sing.

Jesus, wondrous Savior! Christ, of kings the King!
Angels fall before Thee, prostrate worshipping;
Fairest they confess Thee in the Heav’n above.
We would sing Thee fairest here in hymns of love.

When He cometh, when He cometh,
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.

Jimmie, said his kind protector,
Long his faithful friend and 
guide,
Jimmie, do you love the Savior?
Yes, the happy child replied.
Can you tell how much you love 
Him?
All my heart to Him I give;
Love my Savior? Yes, forever,
I will try for Him to live.

John in vision saw the day
When the Judge will hasten down;
Heav’n and earth shall flee away

John saw the Heav’n and earth made new,
The first had passed away,
The holy city coming down,
The new Jerusalem.

Upon the Isle of Patmus
One man was cast one day
As he was left alone to die
He began to pray
The Holy Ghost fell on him
The Spirit, he came down
Well he began to write about the things he saw
The Revelator's name was John

Join all the glorious names
Of wisdom, love, and power,
That ever mortals knew,
That angels ever bore:
All are too mean to speak His worth,
To poor to set my Savior forth.

Join all ye joyful nations
The acclaiming hosts of Heav’n!
This happy morn a Child is born
To us a Son is given.

Join, every tongue, to sing
The mercies of the Lord;
The love of Christ, our King,
Let every heart record.
He saved us from the wrath of God,
And paid our ransom with His blood.

God spoke to Jonah and gave him command:
 “Go east to Nineveh and tell them My plan."
Jonah objected and fled from the Lord;
Soon found a ship headed west, went on board.
Then God sent forth a tempest; upon the ship it beat.
Each man cried to his own god, but Jonah fell asleep.
The sailors came and woke him, his business did demand.
He said, “My God’s the Lord of Heav’n, who made the sea and 
land."

In the Bible we are told
Of a prophet who was called
To a city that was steeped in awful sin;
All the people in that place
Were devoid of saving grace,
And the prophet seemed afraid to enter in.

.

Tum, tum, tumblin' down
Tum, tum, tumblin' down
Tum, tum, tumblin' down
Tum, tum, tumblin' down (I said tum, they come tumblin' down)
Tum, tum, tumblin' down (They come tumblin' down)
Tum, tum, tumblin' down (Way down to the ground)
Tum, tum, tumblin' down

There is joy, glad joy among the angels,
Joy in heav’n above,
When a soul returns from sin and folly
To the Savior’s love.

Joy and light, joy and light,
Over the crystal sea;
Come, come, soft and bright,
Over the crystal sea.
Come on your snowy pinions white,
Come in the silent calm of night,
Watch when the pale stars keep,
Bring the troubled one,
Bring the weary one sleep.

Joy and light, joy and light,
Over the crystal sea;
Come, come, soft and bright,
Over the crystal sea.
Come on your snowy pinions white,
Come in the silent calm of night,
Watch when the pale stars keep,
Bring the troubled one,
Bring the weary one sleep.

Joy and triumph everlasting
Hath the heav’nly Church on high;
For that pure immortal gladness
All our feast days mourn and sigh:
Yet in death’s dark desert wild
Doth the mother aid her child;
Guards celestial thence attend us,
Stand in combat to defend us.

Joy! because the circling year
Brings our day of blessings here;
Day when first the light divine
On the Church began to shine.

Joy bells are ringing,
Christmas is bringing
Tidings of Jesus’ birth.
Candles are gleaming,
Gladness is streaming
Out over all the earth.

O there’ll be joy when the work is done,
Joy when the reapers gather home,
Bringing the sheaves at set of sun
To the New Jerusalem.

Joy dawned again on Easter Day,
The sun shone out with fairer ray,
When, to their longing eyes restored
Th’Apostles saw their risen Lord.

Morning light was dawning o’er the distant hills,
Banished was the midnight gloom;
Silently the angels clad in bright array
Came to guard the dear Redeemer’s tomb.
Soldiers were affrighted and in terror fled,
While the angels roll the stone away.
Then with joy proclaiming, “Christ the Lord is ris’n"
 “See the place where once the Savior lay."

Joy fills our inmost hearts today!
The royal Child is born:
And angel hosts in glad array
His advent keep this morn.

One day I was walking in a world of sin
No rest for my weary soul
Then I met a man who said
He'd be my friend
All my burdens He did roll
God took those worldy desires
Gave me heavenly fire
And now I got a brand new goal
And since3 I met this man called
Jesus Christ
I got the joy joy joy in my soul
I got joy in my heart
Joy in my mind
Joy since that happy day
I got joy in my hands
Joy in my feed
I got joy in every way
God took those worldly desires
Gave me heavenly fire
And now I got a brand new goal
And since I met this man called 
Jesus Christ
I got the joy joy joy in my soul
I got my eyes on Jesus 
got my mind made up
and I tell it everywhere I go
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around
'Cause Jesus is in control
God took those worldly desires
Gave me heavnily fire
And now I got a brand new goal
And since i met this man called
Jesus Christ
I got the joy joy joy in my soul

There is joy in serving Jesus
As I journey on my way
Joy that fills my heart with praises
Every hour and every day
There is joy, joy
Joy in serving Jesus
Joy that throbs within my heart
Every moment, every hour
As I draw upon His power
There is joy, joy
Joy that never shall depart
There is joy in serving Jesus
Joy; that triumphs over pain
Fills my heart with heaven's music
Till I join the glad 
There is joy, joy
Joy in serving Jesus
Joy that throbs within my heart
Every moment, every hour
As I draw upon His power
There is joy, joy
Joy that never shall depart
There is joy in serving Jesus
As I walk alone with God
'Tis the joy of Christ my Saviour
Who the path of suffering trod
There is joy, joy
Joy in serving Jesus
Joy that throbs within my heart
Every moment, every hour
As I draw upon His power
There is joy, joy
Joy that never shall depart
There is joy in serving Jesus
Joy amid the darkest night
For I've learned the wondrous secret
And I'm walking in the light
There is joy, joy
Joy in serving Jesus
Joy that throbs within my heart
Every moment, every hour
As I draw upon His power
There is joy, joy
Joy that never shall depart

I’ve found a joy in sorrow, a secret balm for pain,
A beautiful tomorrow of sunshine after rain;
I’ve found a branch of healing near every bitter spring;
A whispered promise stealing o’er every broken string,
A whispered promise stealing o’er every broken string.

Lord
Sometimes it seems my enemies are laughing at me
So many trials in my way that I can't see

There is joy in the service of the Master,
Let me sing of the glory I have found;
Since I gave all to Jesus, and His favor gained,
Oh, wondrous streams of joy forever abound.

Joy is a fruit that will not grow
In nature’s barren soil;
All we can boast, till Christ we know,
Is vanity and toil.

I have a joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart
Down in my heart, down in my heart
I have a joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart
Down in my heart today

Joy, joy, immortal joy!
The Lord is ris’n to reign;
On Easter day, the Scriptures say,
Christ rose to life again.
On Easter day, the Scriptures say,
Christ rose to life again.

The joy of the Lord will be my strength
I will not falter, I will not faint
He is my Shepherd, I am not afraid
The joy of the Lord is my strength

We need the joy of Thy salvation
It is a strong and mighty shield (mighty shield)
Give us the joy of Thy salvation
So Thy power may be revealed

Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heav'n and nature sing,
And heav'n and nature sing,
And heav'n, and heav'n, and nature sing.

I have found His grace is all complete,
He supplieth every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus’ feet,
I am free, yes, free indeed.

Joy, joy, immortal joy!
The Lord is ris’n to reign;
On Easter day, the Scriptures say,
Christ rose to life again.
On Easter day, the Scriptures say,
Christ rose to life again.

Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
God of glory, Lord of love;
Hearts unfold like flow’rs before Thee,
Op’ning to the sun above.
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
Drive the dark of doubt away;
Giver of immortal gladness,
Fill us with the light of day.

Tell me, watchman, oh, what of the morning
Do you see as the mist clears away?
We behold in its splendor the dawning
Of a bright and glorious day.

Joyful news to all mankind,
Jesus is mighty to save;
All who seek shall surely find
Jesus is mighty to save.
Sinners may relinquish wrong,
Faltering hearts may now be strong;
Sound the tidings right along,
Jesus is mighty, is mighty to save.

Come on now, let's make a joyful noise

Sing with a tuneful song, sing and adore
Jesus the Holy One, King evermore;
He is the desert Rock, there we may hide,
Under His mighty shade safe we abide.

You, You came along
Wrapped Your arms around me made me strong
You are my Joygiver (giver, giver)
You give me strength, You urge me on
Forget about the outside, inside I'm strong
You are my Joygiver (giver, giver)

Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.

Judge eternal, throned in splendor,
Lord of lords and King of kings,
With Thy living fire of judgment
Purge this land of bitter things;
Solace all its wide dominion
With the healing of Thy wings.

Judge me, God of my salvation,
Plead my cause, for Thee I trust;
Hear my earnest supplication,
Save me from my foes unjust;
O my soul, why art thou grieving?
What disquiets and dismays?
Hope in God; His help receiving,
I shall yet my Savior praise.

Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
Against a sinful race;
From vile oppression and deceit
Secure me by Thy grace.
From vile oppression and deceit
Secure me by Thy grace.

The judgment has set, the books have been opened;
How shall we stand in that great day,
When every thought, and word, and action,
God, the righteous Judge, shall weigh?

am weak, but Thou art strong;
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I’ll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

Just a few more days to be filled with praise,
And to tell the old, old story;
Then, when twilight falls, and my Savior calls,
I shall go to Him in glory.

God doesn't love us just a little bit (just a little bit)
The Bible says so if you'll just read it
You know I'm not guessing and it's not just a hunch (it's not a hunch)
God loves us all a great big bunch

I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
And you know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
And then the cloud about me hides the light of day
The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
And you know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and and night
I go to Him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
And you know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Makes everything right

1.
Soon this life will all be over, And our pilgrimage will end.
Soon we'll take our heav’nly journey,
Be at home again with friends
Heaven's gates are standing open
Waiting for our entrance there
Some sweet day we're going over
All the beauties there to share.
Just a Little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait
Just a little while to labor
In the path that’s always straight
Just a little more of trouble
In this low and sinful state
Then we’ll enter Heaven’s portals,
Sweeping thru the pearly gates.
2.
Soon we’ll see the light of morning
Then the new day will begin
Soon we’ll hear the Father calling,
“Come my children, enter in."
Then we’ll hear a choir of angels
Singing out the vict’ry song,
All our troubles will be ended
And we’ll live with heaven’s throng
Just a Little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait
Just a little while to labor
In the path that’s always straight
Just a little more of trouble
In this low and sinful state
Then we’ll enter Heaven’s portals,
Sweeping thru the pearly gates.
3.
Soon we’ll meet again our loved ones
And we’ll take them by the hand,
Soon we’ll press them to our bosom
Over in the promised land;
Then we’ll be at home forever,
Thru-out all eternity,
What a blessed, blessed morning
That eternal morn shall be.
Just a Little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait
Just a little while to labor
In the path that’s always straight
Just a little more of trouble
In this low and sinful state
Then we’ll enter Heaven’s portals,
Sweeping thru the pearly gates.

When time shall come for my leaving
When I bid you adieu
Don't spend your money for flowers
Just a rose will do.
I'll go to a beautiful garden
At last when life's work is through.
Don't spend your money for flowers
Just a rose will do.
I'll need no organization
To make a bid to-do,
I'll need no fine decorations,
Just a rose will do.
I'll go to a beautiful garden
At last when life's work is through.
Don't spend your money for flowers
Just a rose will do.
Just have an old-fashioned preacher
To preach a sermon or two
Don't spend your money for flowers
Just a rose will do.
I'll go to a beautiful garden
At last when life's work is through.
Don't spend your money for flowers
Just a rose will do.

Now just a word for Jesus;
Your dearest Friend so true;
Come, cheer our hearts and tell us
What He hath done for you.

Just are Thy ways, and true Thy Word,
Great Rock of my secure abode:
Who is a god beside the Lord?
Or where’s a refuge like our God?

Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, Thine own to be,
Friend of the young, Who lovest me,
To consecrate myself to Thee,
O Jesus Christ, I come.

Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

My Father, this I ask of Thee;
Knowing that Thou wilt grant the plea—
For this, and only this, I pray
Strength for today—just for today.

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He’ll help you along, help you along,
If you will trust His love unfailing,
He’ll fill your heart with song.

Just like every morning
Waits for the sun
I wait for You, exalting Your love
Drops of dew, smell of mint
Your voice so sweet
I know You are here
Your caress is so light
Like a breeze it blows on me
No, I’m not alone
There’s a sincere love in me
My life, my way, is living to serve You
I’m feeling at this moment
Your hands touching me

Just like You promised You’ve come
Just like You told us You are here
And my desire is that You know
I love You, I worship You
I welcome You here

Just one glimpse of the glory waiting,
Just one note of the seraph’s song—
How it cheers the heart that’s breaking,
How it makes the spirit strong.
Just one touch of the seamless garment,
Just one clasp of the nail-pierced hand—
How it calms the fevered pulses,
How it helps the weak to stand.

Just one touch as He moves along,
Pushed and pressed by the jostling throng,
Just one touch and the weak was strong,
Cured by the Healer divine.

I’ve a home prepared where the saints abide,
Just over in the glory land;
And I long to be by my Savior’s side,
Just over in the glory land.

Just when I need Him, Jesus is near,
Just when I falter, just when I fear;
Ready to help me, ready to cheer,
Just when I need Him most.

Just when I need Him, Jesus is near,
Just when I falter, just when I fear;
Ready to help me, ready to cheer,
Just when I need Him most.

Just when I need Him, Jesus is near,
Just when I falter, just when I fear;
Ready to help me, ready to cheer,
Just when I need Him most.

Just where I am, oh, let me be
A faithful witness, Lord, for Thee;
While others seek a wider sphere,
Oh, keep me faithful, Lord, just here.

Justi.Justi.Justi.Justified

The King is coming in glory
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning
It may be at midday,
At the even or midnight;
The trump will sound so clear,
The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.
A king might miss the guiding star,
A wise man’s foot might stumble;
For Bethlehem is very far
From all except the humble.
’Tis Christmas Day! ’Tis Christmas Day!
And Christian hearts are humble.
Some pilgrims seek a hallowed shrine;
Some soldiers march to danger;
Some travelers seek an inn—its sign
“The Baby in a manger."
When Christ was born on Christmas morn,
They laid Him in a manger.
There is no palace in that place,
Nor any seat of learning,
No hilltop vision of God’s face,
No altar candles burning:
O come and see our Christmas tree
And Christmas candles burning.
But he who gets to Bethlehem
Shall hear the oxen lowing;
And, if he humbly kneel with them,
May catch far trumpets blowing;
From far away, on Christmas Day,
May hear God’s trumpets blowing.

In this wicked world am I,
Watch Thou o’er me from on high;
Keep my soul, lest I should be
Led astray, O Lord, from Thee.
All I am or hope to be,
I commit, dear Lord, to Thee;
Oh, preserve me in Thy love,
Till I reach Thy courts above.
Keep me spotless, keep me pure,
Keep me lest the world allure;
Keep me in Thy secret place,
Where I e’er may see Thy face.
Keep me guiltless night and day,
Help me Thy commands obey;
Keep me humble, let not pride
Ever in my soul abide.
Keep me gentle, let no word
From my lips be ever heard
That shall wound a tender heart,
Cause a tear of grief to start.
Keep me for Thyself alone,
Nevermore to be mine own;
Keep me in Thy favor sweet,
In Thy grace and truth complete.

Source from whence the stream of mercy
Like a river flows to me,
With Thy cords of love so tender
Bind and keep me close to Thee.
Keep me ever close to Thee,
Blessed Savior, dear to me,
With Thy cords of love so tender
Bind and keep me close to Thee;
Keep me ever close to Thee,
Blessed Savior, dear to me,
Bind and keep me close to Thee.
There my life, my hope and comfort,
There a refuge for my soul,
When the clouds hang darkly round me,
And the distant surges roll.
There in holy, sweet communion
With Thy Spirit day by day,
Faith to realms of light and glory
Bears my raptured soul away.
Close to Thee, O Savior, keep me,
Till I reach the shining shore,
Till I join the raptured army,
Shouting joy forevermore.

Keep me in touch with Thee,
My blessed Lord;
Thine shall the glory be,
Mine the reward;
Cover my soul with grace,
In that most holy place,
Till I shall see Thy face,
Keep me, my Lord.
Lord, with Thy gentleness,
I would be great;
Blest with Thy holiness,
Be this my state;
To Thee my all resign, 
Oh, let Thy will be mine,
In Thy great love divine,
Keep me, my Lord.
Conquer my every foe,
While here I stay;
Unto the end I’ll go,
Let me not stray;
Down into nothingness,
Hid in Thy righteousness,
Firm in Thy faithfulness,
Keep me, my Lord.
Oh, let Thy watchful eye,
Be over me;
Hear Thou my humble cry,
Coming to Thee;
Guide Thou my steps aright,
Be Thou my song at night,
My theme and heart’s delight,
Keep me, my Lord.

Keep me near Thee, blessed Jesus,
Keep me near Thee lest I stray;
With Thy mighty hand uphold me,
Lead me gently all the way.
Life without Thee would be dreary,
Cheerless all my path would be;
But while walking in Thy presence,
Heaven’s glory shines on me.
Keep me near Thee, precious Savior,
Many snares are by the way;
’Neath Thy balmy wings protect me,
Draw me nearer Thee each day.
Help me live so near Thee, Jesus,
That Thy whispers I may hear,
Let me feel Thy arms around me
When the hand of danger’s near.
Draw me nearer, blessed Jesus,
Closely fold me to Thy breast;
Pillowed on Thy loving bosom,
Let me ever sweetly rest.

Keep on praying to God on high,
Keep on praying, He hears your cry;
God will answer the sincere heart,
Keep on praying, He will do His part.
For Jesus hears you,
He’s list’ning, list’ning to your plea,
So keep on praying,
And He will answer thee.
Keep on praying when bowed with sin,
Keep on praying and you will win;
Jesus suffered on Calvary,
Keep on praying, He will answer thee.
Keep on praying, you’ll grow in grace,
Keep on praying and win the race;
Jesus loves you, His Word is true,
Keep on praying, He will answer you.
Keep on praying, He’s ever near,
Keep on praying, ’twill banish fear;
“Thro’ the valley" He’ll walk with thee;
Guide thy footsteps to eternity.
Keep on praying all through the strife,
Prayer will purchase a crown of life;
Heav’n is ringing with songs above;
Hallelujahs, for a Savior’s love!

If you池e in the battle for the Lord and right,
Keep on the firing line;
If you win, my brother, surely you must fight,
Keep on the firing line;
There are many dangers that we all must face,
If we die still fighting it is no disgrace;
Cowards in the service will not find a place,
So keep on the firing line.
Oh, you must fight, be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor even lag behind;
If you would win for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.
God will only use the soldier He can trust,
Keep on the firing line;
If you'll wear a crown then bear the cross you must,
Keep on the firing line.
Life is but to labor for the Master dear,
Help to banish evil and to spread good cheer;
Great you'll be rewarded for your service here,
So keep on the firing line.
When we get to heaven, brother, we'll be glad,
Keep on the firing line;
How we'll praise the Savior for the call we had,
Keep on the firing line;
When we see the souls that we have helped to win,
Leading them to Jesus, from the paths of sin,
With a shout of welcome, we will all march in,
So keep on the firing line.

There's a dark and a trouble side of life there's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife the sunny side we also have in view
So keep on the sunny side always on the sunny side keep on the sunny side of 
life
It will help you everyday it will brighten all the way
If you'll keep on the sunny side of life
Oh the storm in its fury broke today crushing hopes that I cherish so dear
Clouds and storms will in time pass away and the sun again will shine bright and 
clear
So keep on the sunny side.
[ guitar - steel ]
Let us greed with a song of hope each day though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust at our Saviour always will keep us everyone in his care
So keep on the sunny side.

On the hilltops, on the mountains,
There are gleams of golden light,
For the promised morn is dawning,
And its star is growing bright.
Keep on watching, O ye faithful,
For the time is drawing nigh—
We shall see the King of glory
With His angels, by and by.
O the promised morn is dawning,
When the ransomed of the King
Shall return and come to Zion,
And His praise forever sing.
Hallelujah! what a moment,
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the trumpet of the ages
Sound in triumph from the skies!
Keep on watching, be not weary,
For the Lord will surely come;
He has said, and we believe it,
He will take His people home.

Spoken Vocal:
What if I don't give you the justice you want and you will be the death of me?
Hey! Pss.yeah, yall come
Gather 'round 
Now let me tell you the story
The Lord told His disciples to pray and not give up
Now there was a town, a judge, they tell me he lived within
Didn't care for nobody, not God, nor big bad men
In the same little place there lived a widow
Bout four foot three
Louder than Gabriel when she shouted the same old plea
"Now listen your honor I'm tellin' the story as plain as it can be
I'm needin' some justice against my adversary
I need it, I want it, I got to have it!" 
(Whenever His children call) Whenever God's children call
(God hears them all) He hears them all
(He's never far away) He's never, never, never far away
(Pray every day) Pray every day
(Never) Never give up
(Give up) Never give in
(Praying) Pray on 
He kept tellin' her,
"Never, now woman you know you're worryin' me
But if I don't give the justice you're wanting
You will be the death of me! (death of me)"
Now if you were blind you could see it as plain as the nose He gave to you
If they can achieve some justice, well think of the things the Lord can do
Now sometimes the wicked they make you sick
But don't be discouraged 'cause justice is comin' quick (justice is coming 
quick)
Please don't think that nobody cares about you
He'll be in the schoolyard (yhe schoolyard)
The workplace (yhe workplace), whatever you do (yes)
He said it, He meant it, and I believe it (I said I believe it) 
(Whenever His children call) Children are callin' Him from all over the world
(God hears them all) But He hears them all
(He's never far away) My God is not far away
(Pray every day)
You got to pray (never Give up Praying) 
Oh, Children prayin' (children prayin')
Pleasin' the Lord (pleasin' the Lord)
And His will obeying (will obeying)
His Holy Word (Holy Word)
Get our hearts together (hearts together)
In one accord (in one accord)
His grace and blessings (grace and blessings)
Is their reward (their reward) 
Now if you're wonderin' what is the message we're sendin' in this small tune
Justice is comin' when you need it, and it might be soon
Now we'd like to leave you with somethin' to keep on your mind as you sing this song
Well if you are prayin' to Jesus
Keep prayin' and prayin' you can't go wrong 
("Keep prayin' and prayin' and prayin', you can't go wrong" repeated in background)
Listen here youngsta,
You think cause you got your eyes closed youe and arms folded
You're prayin' huh?
Well, that's what they told me in church
Oh ya ain't got to have your mouth movin' just to be prayin
Well, it's no use anyway cause I prayed Sunday and nothin' happened
Now see, see that's what your problem is right there
You need to pray everyday, not just Sunday and Wednesday
Are you sure?
You need to be prayin' every day of the week
Well, would-
Oh, we got to pray! We got to pray youngsta, we got to pray
Make a difference 
Stepouts 
Brothers keep on, keep prayin!
(Oh, is that it?) 

Keep silence, all created things,
And wait your Maker’s nod!
My soul stands trembling while she sings
The honors of her God.
Life, death, and hell, and worlds unknown
Hang on His firm decree;
He sits on no precarious throne,
No borrows leave to be.
Chained to His throne, a volume lies,
With all the fates of men,
With every angel’s form and size,
Drawn by th’eternal pen.
His providence unfolds the book,
And makes His counsels shine;
Each opening leaf, and every stroke
Fulfills some deep design.
Here He exalts neglected worms
To scepters and a crown;
And there the following page He turns,
And treads the monarch down.
Not Gabriel asks the reason why,
Nor God the reason gives;
Nor dares the favorite angel pry
Between the folded leaves.
My God, I would not long to see
My fate with curious eyes,
What gloomy lines are writ for me,
Or what bright scenes may rise.
In Thy fair book of life and grace,
O may I find my name
Recorded in some humble place,
Beneath my Lord the Lamb!

If there is abundance of joy in your heart,
Made bright by the light from above,
If Jesus has bidden your sorrows depart,
Keep telling the story of love.
Keep telling, keep telling,
Of Jesus and Heaven above;
Keep telling to others you meet on the way,
The wonderful story of love.
If you would win others for Jesus today,
Bright stars for your crown up above,
Keep joyfully telling to all on the way,
The beautiful story of love.
Keep telling of Jesus, His cross and His grave,
Keep telling of Heaven above;
Keep telling—Christ risen and able to save,
The powerful story of love.

We may lighten toil and care,
Or a heavy burden share,
With a word, a kindly deed, or sunny smile;
We may girdle day and night
With a halo of delight,
If we keep the heart singing all the while.
Keep the heart singing all the while;
Make the world brighter with a smile;
Keep the song ringing! Lonely hours we may beguile,
If we keep the heart singing all the while.
If His love is in the soul,
And we yield to His control,
Sweetest music will the lonely hours beguile;
We may drive the clouds away,
Cheer and bless the darkest day,
If we keep the heart singing all the while.
How a word of love will cheer,
Kindle hope, and banish fear,
Soothe a pain, or take away the sting of guile;
Oh, how much we all may do,
In the world we travel through,
If we keep the heart singing all the while.

Jesus, Savior, oh, how trustfully
I lean on Thee where’er I go;
In Thy mercy Thou wilt shelter me,
From storms that beat, and winds that blow.
Trusting, I am trusting,
Trusting, I am trusting;
Trusting, trusting, Lord, in Thee;
Ever keep Thou me.
Jesus, Savior, oh, how tenderly
Within my heart Thy words I hear;
Thro’ Thy Spirit sweetly telling me,
That I am safe, for Thou art near.
Jesus, Savior, oh, how joyfully
I give my all to Thy control;
Clouds may gather, yet how peacefully,
The sun shines brightly in my soul.
Jesus, Savior, Thou hast promised me
That o’er life’s billows, wild and dark,
Safely, surely Thou wilt anchor me,
And homeward bring my wave-tossed bark.

Keep Thou my way, O Lord, be Thou ever nigh;
Strong is Thy mighty arm, weak and frail am I;
Then, my unchanging Friend, on Thee, my hopes depend,
Till life’s brief day shall end, be Thou ever nigh.
Keep Thou my heart, O Lord, ever close to Thee;
Safe in Thine arms of love, shall my refuge be;
Then, over a tranquil tide, my bark shall safely glide;
I shall be satisfied, ever close to Thee.
Keep Thou my all, O Lord, hide my life in Thine;
O let Thy sacred light over my pathway shine;
Kept by Thy tender care, gladly the cross I’ll bear;
Hear Thou and grant my prayer, hide my life in Thine.

Keep thyself pure! Christ’s soldier, hear,
Through life’s loud strife, the calls rings clear.
Thy Captain speaks: His word obey;
So shall thy strength by as thy day.
Keep thyself pure! Thrice blessed he
Whose heart from taint of sin is free;
His feet shall stand where saints have trod,
He with rapt eyes shall see his God.
Keep thyself pure! For He Who died,
Himself for thy sake sanctified;
Then hear Him speaking from the skies,
And victor o’er temptation rise.
O Holy Spirit, keep us pure,
Grant us Thy strength when sins allure;
Our bodies are Thy temple, Lord;
Be Thou in thought and act adored.

Keep your colors flying,
All ye Christian youth,
To Christ’s call replying,
Full of grace and truth.
Rise in strength and beauty,
In life’s morning glow,
Answer to each duty,
Onward, upward go.
Keep your colors flying,
Stand for God and truth,
Keep your colors flying,
All ye Christian youth.
Life is all before you
Where to choose your way,
Keep Christ’s colors o’er you;
Watch and fight and pray,
With a firm endeavor,
Ev’ry foe defy,
True to Jesus ever,
Lift your colors high.
Keep your colors flying,
Never think of ease;
Sin and self denying,
Jesus only please.
Not for worldly pleasure,
Not for worldly fame,
Not for heaps of treasure,
Live for Jesus’ Name!
Keep your colors flying,
Walk as Jesus did;
In Him living, dying,
Let your life be hid;
Hoping, trusting, ever,
Breathe this mortal breath;
You shall live forever,
Christ has conquered death.

We are kept by the power and favor of God
From all the dominion of sin;
He cleanseth by faith in His own precious blood,
His spirit is reigning within.
We are kept by the power of God,
We are kept by the power of God;
By trusting, obeying,
By watching and praying,
We are kept by the power of God.
We are kept by the power of God through faith
So long as we walk in the light;
Our helper is Jesus who faithfully saith,
“I’m with you by day and by night." 
We are kept by the power of God if we trust,
We never need faint by the way;
Then do as He bids you, His counsel is just,
Be humble, be watchful, and pray.
We are kept by the power of God each day,
The story of grace we’ll repeat;
Through Him we are conquerors if we obey,
The foe we will ever defeat.

Oh, to be 適ept for Jesus!"
Kept, by the power of God;
Kept from the world unspotted,
Treading where Jesus trod.
Oh, to be 適ept for Jesus!"
Lord, at Thy feet I fall;
I would be 渡othing, nothing, nothing";
Thou shall be 殿ll in all."
Oh, to be 適ept for Jesus!"
Serving as He shall choose;
適ept" for the Master?s pleasure;
適ept" for the Master?s use.
Oh, to be 適ept for Jesus!"
Kept from the world apart;
Lowly in mind and spirit,
Gentle and pure in heart.
Oh, to be 適ept for Jesus!"
Oh, to be all His own;
Kept, to be His forever,
Kept, to be His alone!

Kind words can never die; cherished and blest,
God knows how deep they lie, stored in the breast;
Like childhood’s simple rhymes, said o’er a thousand times;
Aye, in all years and climes, distant and near.
Kind words can never die, never die, never die;
Kind words can never die, no, never die.
Sweet thoughts can never die, though, like the flow’rs,
Their brightest hues may fly in wintry hours;
But when the gentle dew gives them their charms anew,
With many an added hue they bloom again.
Sweet thoughts can never die, never die, never die;
Sweet thoughts can never die, no, never die.
Our souls can never die, though in the tomb
We all may have to lie, wrapped in its gloom;
What though the flesh decay, souls pass in peace away,
Live though eternal day, with Christ above.
Our souls can never die, never die, never die;
Our souls can never die, no, never die.

Kindly spring again is here,
trees and fields in bloom appear;
hark! the birds with artless lays
warble their Creator's praise.
Where in winter all was snow,
now the flowers in clusters grow;
and the corn, in green array,
promises a harvest-day.
Lord, afford a spring to me,
let me feel what I see;
speak, and by thy gracious voice,
make my drooping soul rejoice.
On thy garden deign to smile,
raise the plants, enrich the soil;
soon thy presence will restore
life to what seemed dead before.

Kindred in Christ, For His Dear Sake
A hearty welcome here receive;
May we together now partake
The joys which only he can give.
To you and us by grace 'tis giv'n.
To know the Savior's precious name;
And shortly we shall meet in heav'n
Our hope, our way, our end the same.
May he, by whose kind care we meet,
Send His good Spirit from above,
Make our communication sweet,
And cause our hearts to burn with love.
Forgotten be each worldly theme,
When Christians see each other thus:
We only wish to speak of Him
Who lived, and died, and reigns for us.
We'll talk of all he did and said,
And suffered for us here below;
The path He marked for us to tread,
And what he's doing for us now.
Thus as the moments pass away,
We'll love, and wonder, and adore;
And hasten to the glorious day
When we shall meet to part no more.

Praise God, He's coming for me
The marketplace is empty, no more traffic in the street
All the builder's tools are silent, no more time to harvest wheat
Busy housewives cease their labor, in the courtroom no debate
Work on earth has been suspended as the King comes through the gate
Happy faces line the hallway, those whose lives have been redeemed
Broken homes He has mended, those from prison He has freed
Little children and the aged hand in hand stand all a-glow
Who were crippled, broken, ruined, clad in garments white as snow
The King is coming, the King is coming
I just heard the trumpet sounding and soon His face I'll see
The King is coming, the King is coming
Praise God, He's coming for me
I can hear the chariot's rumble, I can see the marching throng
And the fury of God's trumpet spells the end of sin and wrong
Regal rolls are now unfolded, heaven's grandstands all in place
Heaven's choir is now assembled, start to sing "Amazing Grace"
Praise God, He's coming for me, for me, for m.

King of glory, King of peace,
I will love Thee;
And that love may never cease,
I will move Thee.
Thou hast granted my request,
Thou hast heard me;
Thou didst note my working breast,
Thou hast spared me.
Wherefore with my utmost art
I will sing Thee,
And the cream of all my heart
I will bring Thee.
Though my sins against me cried,
Thou alone didst clear me;
And alone, when they replied,
Thou didst hear me.
Seven whole days, not one in seven,
I will praise Thee;
In my heart, though not in Heaven,
I can raise Thee.
Small it is, in this poor sort
To enroll Thee:
E’en eternity’s too short
To extol Thee.

Immortal, invisible, King of Heaven, Lord Most High
Honor now we give to You, Author of eternal life
Power, wisdom, strength, and blessing, You are worthy to receive our praise
Immortal, invisible, Lord to You all praise be!
Immortal, invisible, Ever faithful ever true
Overcome with love and awe, Lord of Hosts we worship You.
Now in humble adoration, placing all before Your royal throne
Immortal, invisible, Savior we are Yours alone!

King of Kings and Lord of Lords glory hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords forever the same
King of Kings and Lord of Lords glory hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords glory praise His name
Written through the tapestry of time there is a legend
Of a man who loved until the bride took His life
Living in her broken world of lies and deception
As He takes her pain and sin, easing her strife
A call comes ringing out across the plain
Telling us that Jesus Christ is risen - Again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Found within society is poverty and hating
When it comes to knowing who the life giver is
Sitting back in padded pews we're not contemplating
Going out to all the world and making them His
And so the cross it would seem was for vain
(forever and ever,forever and ever,forever and ever,forever and ever)
Still the call rings telling all He's risen - Again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
King of Kings (forever and ever, hallelujah, hallelujah)
And Lord of Lords (forever and ever, hallelujah, hallelujah)
King of Kings and Lords hallelujah (And He shall reign forever, He shall reign forever
He shall reign forever, He shall reign forever
King of Kings, Lord of Lords (and ever), King of Kings (He shall reign forever)
King of Kings, King of Kings, King of Kings
King of Kings!

King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Glory, hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Glory, hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Glory, hallelujah 
King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Jesus, Prince of Peace)
Glory hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Jesus, Prince of Peace)
Glory hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Jesus, Prince of Peace)
Glory hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Jesus, Prince of Peace)
Glory hallelujah 
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Glory, hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Glory, hallelujah 
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Glory, hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Glory, hallelujah 
King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Jesus, Prince of Peace)
Glory hallelujah
King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Jesus, Prince of Peace)
Glory hallelujah 

King of my life, I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn crowned brow,
Lead me to Calvary.
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.
Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.
Let me like Mary, through the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.
May I be willing, Lord, to bear
Daily my cross for Thee;
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Great and marvelous are Thy works
Lord God almighty
Just and true are Thy ways oh Lord
For You are the King of saints
Who shall not fear Thee
Who shall not glorify Thy name oh Lord
For only Thou are holy
All the nations shall come
And worship before Thee
For Thy judgments are made manifest
For Thy judgments are made manifest
Hallelujah
Hallelujah to the King of saints
Glory hallelujah
Glory hallelujah to the King of saints

King of saints, to Whom the number
Of Thy starry host is known,
Many a name, by man forgotten,
Lives forever round Thy throne;
Lights, which earth-born mists have darkened,
There are shining full and clear,
Princes in the court of Heaven,
Nameless, unremembered here.
In the roll of Thine apostles
One there stands, Bartholomew,
He for whom today we offer,
Year by year, our praises due;
How he toiled for Thee and suffered
None on earth can now record;
All his saintly life is hidden
In the knowledge of his Lord.
Was it he, beneath the fig tree
Seen of Thee, and guileless found;
He who saw the good he longed for
Rise from Nazareth’s barren ground;
He who met his risen Master
On the shore of Galilee;
He to whom the word was spoken,
“Greater things thou yet shall see"?
None can tell us; all is written
In the Lamb’s great book of life,
All the faith, and prayer, and patience,
All the toiling, and the strife;
There are told Thy hidden treasures;
Number us, O Lord, with them,
When Thou makest up the jewels
Of Thy living diadem.

King of saints, we offer
highest praise to thee,
who didst free thy servants
from captivity;
sending thine apostles
to convey thy grace
unto every nation
and to every race.
Two of thine apostles 
we remember now,
whom thou didst so freely
with thy grace endow.
Thou unto Saint Philip
hast thyself revealed,
one with God the Father
though in flesh concealed.
O how can we thank thee
for the light conferred
by Saint James thy servant,
in his faithful word.
Like these two apostles
faithful unto death,
may we love and serve thee
till our latest breath.
Make us dear Redeemer,
more and more like thee,
be the Way to lead us
o'er life's dark sea;
be the Truth to light us
to our home on high;
be the Life within us
that can never die.

Zion’s mount His royal seat,
And no pow’r His throne shall move;
Ages gather at His feet,
Son of God’s eternal love.
Hail, hail, King of Zion!
Hail, Lord of lords, and King of kings!
Reign forever, King of Zion;
Reign, blessed King, forevermore.
All the world His Name shall fear,
All the world from shore to shore;
Every isle His voice shall hear,
And the heathen rage no more.
He shall mold each stubborn will,
As the potter molds the clay,
Till rebellious hearts are stilled,
And submissive to His sway.
Haste our early gifts to bring,
Haste obedient faith to prove,
Haste with songs to Zion’s King,
Son of God’s eternal love.

Kneel at the cross,
Christ will meet you there,
Come while he waits for you;
List to his voice,
Leave with him your care
And begin life a new.
Kneel at the cross,
There is room for all
Who would His glory share;
Bliss there awaits,
Harm can ne'er befall
Those who are anchored there.
Kneel at the cross,
Give your idols up,
Look unto realms above;
Turn not away
To life's sparkling cup;
Trust only in His love.
Kneel at the cross,
(Kneel at the cross Kneel at the cross),
Leave ev'ry care
(Leave ev'ry care Leave ev'ry care);
Kneel at the cross,
(Kneel at the cross),
Jesus will meet you there.

O’er the door of heaven’s kingdom
Are the words forever true,
“If ye knock it shall be opened"—
Opened, sinner, yes, to you.
Sinner, come, why still delay?
Knock at mercy’s door today;
“Lost and guilty," be thy plea,
Then ’twill open wide to thee.
Oh, how kind this proclamation
To the vilest sinner lost—
Perfect, free and full salvation,
Purchased at a boundless cost.
See the blessed invitation:
“He that knocks may enter in";
Will you now accept the offer,
Casting off your load of sin? 
Have you long withstood His mercy?
Has your heart unfeeling grown?
“He that knocketh here may enter,"
Is as sure as heaven’s throne.
Come, poor sinner, read the writing,
Knock at mercy’s door today;
Hear the love of God inviting,
Come and enter while you may.

Knock)
Spoken Vocal: "What was that?" "I think somebody’s knocking at the door" "Who

If you will answer He’ll carry you through
He’s knockin’ (knock, knock)
Knockin’ at your door (knockin' at your door)
In these days of tribulation
We’re oppressed by what we hear (what we hear)
And the worldly noise around us

If you will answer He’ll carry you through
He’s knockin’ (knock, knock)
Knockin’ at your door (knockin' at your door)
Now there are those who heard the calling
But continue on their way (on their way)
Someday I will obey Him
That’s exactly what they say
But I know a day is coming
And that’s one thing for sure
And He’ll be knockin’ (knock, knock)
Knockin’ at your door
The Savior is knockin’ at your door (won't you let Him in)
Won’t you let Him in
He’s knockin’ at your door (won't you let the Savior in)

Won’t you let Him in
Knock and the door will be opened to you (and He will carry you through)
If you will answer He’ll carry you through
He’s knockin’ (knock, knock)
Knockin’ at your door (knockin' at your door)

Knockin’ at your door (knockin' at your door)
Oh yeah He’s knockin’ (knock, knock)
Knockin’ at your door (don't you hear knockin' at your door) (knockin' at your 
door)

Knocking, knocking, who is there?
Waiting, waiting, oh, how fair!
’Tis a Pilgrim, strange and kingly,
Never such was seen before,
Ah, my soul, for such a wonder,
Wilt thou not undo the door?
Knocking, knocking! still He’s there:
Waiting, waiting, wondrous fair!
But the door is hard to open
For the weeds and ivy vine,
With their dark and clinging tendrils,
Ever round the hinges twine.
Knocking, knocking—what, still there?
Waiting, waiting, grand and fair!
Yes, the pierced hand still knocketh,
And beneath the crowned hair
Beam the patient eyes, so tender,
Of thy Savior waiting there.

Know ye the Lord hath borne away
Your Master from your head today?
Yea, we know it; yet we raise
Joyous strains of hope and praise!
He is gone, but not before
All His earthly work is o’er.
Alleluia!
Know ye the Lord hath borne away
Your Master from your head today?
Yea, we know it; stand afar;
Mark His bright triumphal car,
Mighty end of mighty deeds,
Clouds His chariot, winds His steeds!
Alleluia!
Know ye the Lord hath borne away
Your Master from your head today?
Yea, we know it; ere He left,
Jordan’s stream in twain was cleft;
With that glorious act in view,
We shall one day cleave it, too!
Alleluia!
Know ye the Lord hath borne away
Your Master from your head today?
Yea, we know it; wondrous love
Bids Him seek His Home above;
He hath said ’tis better so;
See His mantle dropped below!
Alleluia!
Know ye the Lord hath borne away
Your Master from your head today?
Yea, we know it; lo! we trace
Plenteous portions of His grace,
Sent to all whose hearts can soar
Whither He has gone before.
Alleluia!
Know ye the Lord hath borne away
Your Master from your head today?
Yea, we know it; search would fail,
If ye passed through mount and vale;
Earth contains Him not, though wide;
Seek Him at His Father’s side!

Rejoice! Rejoice! our King is coming!
And the time will not be long,
Until we hail the radiant dawning,
And lift up the glad new song.
Oh, wondrous day! oh, glorious morning,
When the Son of Man shall come!
May we with lamps all trimmed and burning
Gladly welcome His return!
Rejoice! Rejoice! our King is coming!
And the time will not be long,
Until we hail the radiant dawning,
And lift up the glad new song.
With joy we wait our King’s returning
From His heavenly mansions fair;
And with ten thousand saints appearing
We shall meet Him in the air.
Oh, may we never weary, watching,
Never lay our armor down
Until He come, and with rejoicing
Give to each the promised crown.

The King is coming in glory
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning
It may be at midday,
At the even or midnight;
The trump will sound so clear,
The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.
The King is coming, hallelujah!
He’s coming in the air,
The fig tree is budding,
The signs are everywhere,
The King is coming, hallelujah!
He’s coming in the air,
He’s coming, hallelujah!
To catch His bride away.
Behold! He cometh, and leaping,
And skipping o’er the hills;
Like the young roe, like the young hart,
My soul with rapture thrills;
Thru the window He’s looking,
Thru the lattice work is seen,
The winter’s past, the rain is o’er,
The figs are green.
The King is coming,
“Be ready," To meet Him on that day;
With your heart right, with your robes white,
And in this holy way;
Like the lightning that flashes
In the twinkling of an eye,
Our Lord shall come to claim His own,
He’s drawing nigh.
The saints are looking ever upward
While journ’ing on their way.
He’s coming, hallelujah!
To catch His bride away.
The saints are looking ever upward
While journ’ing on their way.
He’s coming, hallelujah!
To catch His bride away.

The King of Glory standeth beside the heart of sin;
His mighty voice commandeth the raging waves within;
The floods of deepest anguish roll backward at His will,
As o’er the storm ariseth His mandate, “Peace, be still."
At times, with sudden glory, He speaks, and all is done;
Without one stroke of battle the victory is won,
While we, with joy beholding, can scarce believe it true
That e’en our kingly Jesus can form such hearts anew.
O Christ, Thy love is mighty; long suffering is Thy grace;
And glorious is the splendor that beameth from Thy face.
Our hearts upleap in gladness when we behold that love,
As we go singing onward, to dwell with Thee above.

The King of Heav’n His table spreads,
And blessings crown the board;
Not paradise, with all its joys,
Could such delight afford.
Pardon and peace to dying men,
And endless life are giv’n,
Through the rich blood that Jesus shed
To raise our souls to Heav’n.
Ye hungry poor, that long have strayed
In sin’s dark mazes, come:
Come from the hedges and highways
And grace shall find you room.
Millions of souls, in glory now,
Were fed and feasted here;
And millions more, still on the way,
Around the board appear.
Yet is His house and heart so large,
That millions more may come;
Nor could the wide assembling world
O’erfill the spacious room.
All things are ready, come away,
Nor weak excuses frame;
Crowd to your places at the feast;
And bless the Founder’s Name.

The King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never,
I nothing lack if I am His
And He is mine forever.
Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And where the verdant pastures grow,
With food celestial feedeth.
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home, rejoicing, brought me.
In death’s dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy cross before to guide me.
Thou spread’st a table in my sight;
Thy unction grace bestoweth;
And O what transport of delight
From Thy pure chalice floweth!
And so through all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever.

The King shall come when morning dawns,
And light triumphant breaks;
When beauty gilds the eastern hills,
And life to joy awakes.
Not as of old a little child
To bear, and fight, and die,
But crowned with glory like the sun
That lights the morning sky.
O brighter than the rising morn
When He, victorious, rose,
And left the lonesome place of death,
Despite the rage of foes.
O brighter than that glorious morn
Shall this fair morning be,
When Christ, our King, in beauty comes,
And we His face shall see.
The King shall come when morning dawns,
And earth’s dark night is past;
O haste the rising of that morn,
The day that aye shall last.
And let the endless bliss begin,
By weary saints foretold,
When right shall triumph over wrong,
And truth shall be extolled.
The King shall come when morning dawns,
And light and beauty brings:
Hail, Christ the Lord! Thy people pray,
Come quickly, King of kings.

From all the dark places of earth’s heathen races,
O see how the thick shadows fly!
The voice of salvation awakes every nation,
Come over and help us, they cry.
The kingdom is coming, O tell ye the story,
God’s banner exalted shall be!
The earth shall be full of His knowledge and glory,
As waters that cover the sea.
The sunlight is glancing o’er armies advancing
To conquer the kingdoms of sin;
Our Lord shall possess them,
His presence shall bless them,
His beauty shall enter them in.
With shouting and singing, and jubilant ringing,
Their arms of rebellion cast down;
At last every nation the Lord of salvation
Their King and Redeemer shall crown!

I am a stranger here, within a foreign land;
My home is far away, upon a golden strand;
Ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea,
I’m here on business for my King.
This is the message that I bring,
A message angels fain would sing:
“Oh, be ye reconciled,"
Thus saith my Lord and King,
“Oh, be ye reconciled to God."
This is the King’s command: that all men, everywhere,
Repent and turn away from sin’s seductive snare;
That all who will obey, with Him shall reign for aye,
And that’s my business for my King.
My home is brighter far than Sharon’s rosy plain,
Eternal life and joy throughout its vast domain;
My Sovereign bids me tell how mortals there may dwell,
And that’s my business for my King.

Wherever you may be, whatever you may see,
That would lead you into evil, say you nay,
I will not turn aside; whatever may betide,
I’ll keep along the middle of the King’s highway.
The King’s highway, the King’s highway,
I’ll keep along the middle of the King’s highway;
I will not turn aside; whatever may betide,
I’ll keep along the middle of the King’s highway.
The meadows may be green, where bypath stile is seen,
Turn aside, the little flowers seem to say;
Be sure you take no heed—they’re trying to mislead—
Just keep along the middle of the King’s highway.
For on enchanted ground, there’s danger all around,
And a thousand pleasant voices bid you stay,
With fingers stop your ears, and never mind the jeers,
Just keep along the middle of the King’s highway.
Our God will guide us right, and walking in the light,
We shall win a crown of glory in the day,
When Jesus calls His own together round the throne,
Who keep along the middle of the King’s highway.

The kings of the east are riding
Tonight to Bethlehem;
The sunset glows dividing,
The kings of the east are riding,
A star their journey guiding,
Gleaming with gold and gem.
The kings of the east are riding
Tonight to Bethlehem.
To a strange sweet song of Zion
The starry host troops forth:
The golden glaived Orion
To a strange sweet song of Zion,
The Archer and the Lion,
The watchers of the north:
To a strange sweet song of Zion
The starry host troops forth.
There beams above a manger
The child face of a star;
Amid the stars a stranger,
It beams above a manger,
What means this ether ranger
To pause where poor folk are?
There beams above a manger
The child face of a star.

In the harvest field there is work to do,
For the grain is ripe, and the reapers few;
And the Master’s voice bids the workers true
Heed the call that He gives today.

Up to the throne of God is borne
The voice of praise at early morn,
And he accepts the punctual hymn
Sung as the light of day grows dim

Laden with guilt, and full of fears,
I fly to Thee, my Lord,
And not a glimpse of hope appears
But in Thy written Word.

A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth,
The guilt of all men bearing;
And laden with the sins of earth,
None else the burden sharing!
Goes patient on, grow weak and faint,
To slaughter led without complaint,
That spotless life to offer;
Bears shame and stripes, and wounds and death,
Anguish and mockery, and saith,
“Willing all this I suffer."

Hear the story from God's Word that kings

Lamb of God, I look to thee;
thou shalt my example be,
thou art gentle, meek and mild;
thou wast once a little child.
Lord, I would be as thou art;
give me thine obedient heart;
thou art pitiful and kind,
let me have thy loving mind.
Let me, above all, fulfill
God my heavenly Father's will;
never his good Spirit grieve;
only to his glory live.
Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,
in thy gracious hands I am;
make me, Savior, what thou art,
like thyself within my heart.
I shall then show forth thy praise,
serve thee all my happy days;
then the world shall always see
Christ the holy Child in me.

Lamb of God, pure and holy,
Who on the cross didst suffer,
Ever patient and lowly,
Thyself to scorn didst offer.
All sins Thou borest for us,
Else had despair reigned o'er us:
Have mercy on us, 0 Jesus!

Lamb of God, to thee we raise
hymns of holy love and praise,
for the saint and prophet born
to be herald of the morn.
Like the morning star he rose
thine appearing to disclose,
like an ensign lifted high
he declared thy kingdom nigh.
Filled with grace and sanctity
from his blest nativity,
he, the new Elijah, came
bearing zeal's most sacred flame.
Kinsman of the King divine,
greatest of the prophet's line,
blest forerunner of the Lord,
who his praises can record?
Mighty preacher, by whose word
souls to penitence were stirred,
those who long in sin had strayed
then the call divine obeyed.
Make us, Lord, like him to be
fearless witnesses for thee,
faithful unto death be found,
and at last by thee be crowned.

Lamb of God, we fall before Thee,
Humbly trusting in Thy cross.
That alone be all our glory;
All things else are only dross.

Lamb of God, whose dying love
We now recall to mind,
Send the answer from above,
And let us mercy find;
Think on us, who think on thee;
And every struggling soul release:
O remember Calvary,
And bid us go in peace!
By thine agonising pain
And bloody sweat, we pray,
By thy dying love to man,
Take all our sins away;
Burst our bonds, and set us free;
From all iniquity release:
O remember Calvary,
And bid us go in peace!
Lord, we would not hence depart,
Till thou our wants relieve,
Write forgiveness on our heart,
And all thine image give.
Still our souls shall cry to thee,
Till perfected in holiness:
O remember Calvary,
And bid us go in peace!

Lamb of God! Our souls adore Thee
While upon Thy face we gaze;
There the Father’s love and glory
Shine in all their brightest rays;
Thine almighty power and wisdom
All creation’s works proclaim;
Heaven and earth alike confess Thee
As the ever great “I AM."

Lamb of God, we fall before Thee,
Humbly trusting in Thy cross.
That alone be all our glory;
All things else are only dross.

The Lamb’s high banquet called to share,
Arrayed in garments white and fair,
The Red Sea past, we fain would sing
To Jesus our triumphant King.

The Lamb’s high banquet we await
In snow white robes of royal state;
And now, the Red Sea’s channel past,
To Christ, our Prince, we sing at last.

I see mournful faces, I see long, hard looks
Is the Christian happy as he reaches for books
I see lonely people, I see poor and vain
Can a Christian touch them, are we all to blame?

O my God, save me
For the waters, they strangle me
I’m so tired of calling out
And my eyes of crying
Waiting so long for Your salvation
Must I suffer wrong
In hands of those who hate me?
Don’t leave me alone for I just have You
I have long endured attacks because of You
My face is all scarred, waiting so long
O my God, rescue me
I’m reduced to ashes
All my friends abandoned me
I am alone, they despise me
Don’t reject me in my old age
When my body fails in strength to serve You
In You I find refuge for I just have Yoh

Lamp of our feet whereby we trace
Our path when wont to stray;
Stream from the fount of heav’nly 
grace,
Brook by the traveler’s way.

Let your lamps be trimmed and 
burning,
Lest your feet may go astray!
If you are the Lord’s disciple,
Unto sinners show the way!

[Land of our birth, we pledge to thee
our love and toil in the years to be,
when we are grown and take our place
as men and women with our race.]
Father in heaven, who lovest all,
O help thy children when they call,
that they may build from age to age
an undefiled heritage.
Teach us to bear the yoke in youth,
with steadfastness and careful truth,
that, in our time, thy grace may give
the truth whereby the nations live.
Teach us to rule ourselves alway,
controlled and cleanly night and day,
that we may bring, if need arise,
no maimed or worthless sacrifice.
Teach us to look in all our ends,
on thee for Judge, and not our friends,
that we, with thee, may walk uncowed
by fear or favor of the crowd.
Teach us the strength that cannot seek,
by deed or thought, to hurt the weak,
that, under thee, we may possess
man's strength to comfort man's distress.
Teach us delight in simple things,
and mirth that has no bitter springs,
forgiveness free of evil done,
and love to all men 'neath the sun.
[Land of our birth, our faith, our pride,
for whose dear sake our fathers died;
O Motherland, we pledge to thee
head, heart and hand through the years to be.]

Some glad day my soul will fly way up high in the sky
Far above this land of grief and woe
With my Lord I'll fly away on that day, happy day
To that land where living waters flow

The lands that long in darkness lay
Now have beheld a heav’nly light;
Nations that sat in death’s cold shade
Are blessed with beams divinely bright.

Father, I scarcely dare to 
pray,
So clear I see, now it is done,
How I have wasted half my day,
And left my work but just 
begun.
So clear I see that things I 
thought
Were right or harmless were a 
sin;
So clear I see that I have 
sought,
Unconscious, selfish aims to 
win.

Laud, O Zion, thy salvation,
laud with hymns of exultation
Christ, thy King and Shepherd true:
spend thyself, his honor raising,
who surpasseth all thy praising;
never canst thou reach his due.
Sing today, the mystery showing
of the living, life bestowing 
Bread from heaven before thee set;
e'en the same of old provided,
where the Twelve, divinely guided,
at the holy Table met.
Full and clear ring out thy chanting,
joy nor sweetest grace be wanting
to thy heart and soul today;
when we gather up the measure
of that Supper and its treasure,
keeping feast in glad array.
Lo, the new King's Table gracing, 
this new Passover of blessing
hath fulfilled the elder rite;
now the new the old effaceth,
truth revealed the shadow chaseth,
day is breaking the night.
What he did at Supper seated,
Christ ordained be repeated,
his memorial ne'er to cease:
and, his word for guidance taking,
bread and wine we hallow, making
thus our sacrifice of peace.
This the truth to Christians given:
Bread becomes his Flesh from heaven,
Wine becomes his holy Blood.
Doth it pass thy comprehending?
Yet by faith, thy sight transcending,
wondrous things are understood.
Yea, beneath these signs are bidden
glorious things to sight forbidden:
look not on the outward sign.
Wine is poured and Bread is broken.
but in either sacred token
Christ is here by power divine.
Whoso of this Food partaketh,
rendeth not the Lord nor breaketh:
Christ is whole to all that taste.
Thousands are, as one, receivers,
one, as thousands of believers,
takes the Food that cannot waste.
Good and evil men are sharing
one repast, a doom preparing
varied as the heart of man;
doom of life or death awarded,
as their days shall be recorded
which from one beginning ran.
When the Sacrament is broken, 
doubt not in each severed token,
hallowed by the word once spoken,
resteth all the true content:
nought the precious Gift divideth,
breaking but the sign betideth,
he himself the same abideth,
nothing of his fullness spent.

Laurels, fresh laurels, for 
the Sunday School we bring;
They will bloom in fadeless 
verdure
Through a calm eternal 
spring;
Then gladly hail with a pure 
delight,
Oh, hail our beautiful wreath 
so bright;
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels," for 
the Sunday School, for the 
Sunday School,
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels," for 
the Sunday School we bring.

Lavish love, abundant beauty, gracious gifts for heart and hand,
Life that fills the soul and senses--all burst forth at Your command.
Lord, our Lord, Eternal Father, Great Creator, God and Friend,
Boundless pow'r gave full expression to Your love which knows no end.

The Law commands and makes 
us know
What duties to our God we 
owe;
But ’tis the Gospel must 
reveal
Where lies our strength to 
do His will.

The law of God is good 
and wise,
And sets His will before 
our eyes,
Shows us the way of 
righteousness,
And dooms to death when 
we transgress.

It's a cold, cold world, that we're walking through,
Lay down the burden of your heart.
But it's warm as toast, walking two by two,
Lay down the burden of your heart.

Oh, come, sinner, come! 
 ’tis mercy’s call;
Here at Jesus’ feet!
Oh come, and, 
repenting, lay thy all
Down at Jesus’ feet!

Lead kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,
Lead though me on
The night is dark and I am far from home
Lead thou me on.
Keep thou my feet, I do not ask to see
The distant scene one step enough for me
I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
Should'st lead me on.
I loved to choose and see my path but now,
Lead Thou me on.
I loved the garish day, and spite of fears
Pride ruled my will, remember not past years
So long Thy powers has blest me,
Sure it still will lead me on.
O'er moon and fern, o'er crag and torrent, and till the night is 
gone,
And with the morn those angel faces smile.
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

Lead kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,

Lead me gently 
home, Father,
Lead me gently 
home,
When life’s toils 
are ended
And parting days 
have come;
Sin no more shall 
tempt me,
Ne’er from Thee 
I’ll roam,
If Thou’lt only 
lead me, Father,
Lead me gently 
home.

Jesus, lead me up 
the mountain,
Where the whitest 
robes are seen,
Where the saints 
can see the 
fountain,
Where the pure 
are keeping 
clean.

Lead me lord, lead me lord!
By the light of truth
To seek and to find the narrow way…
Be my way, be my truth, be my light O lord!

Lead them, 
my God, to 
Thee,
Lead them 
to Thee,
These 
children 
dear of 
mine,
Thou gavest 
me.
O, by Thy 
love 
divine,

King of my 
life, I crown 
Thee now,
Thine shall the 
glory be;
Lest I forget 
Thy thorn 
crowned brow,
Lead me to 
Calvary.

I was hurting all alone
And I was searching for a comfort I could find on my own
With no direction, feeling down
My life was heading for disaster 'til you turned me around
Nothing ever had been able to ease me
When trying to please me
It only pleased me less
But when I learned about the way that you loved me
Had to put your honor above me
And you gave me rest

Oh sometimes the shadows are deep
And rough seems the path to the goal
And sorrows sometimes how they sweep
Like tempests and over the soul
Oh then to the rock let me fly (let me fly)
To the rock that is higher than I (higher than I)
Oh then to the rock let me fly (let me fly)
To the rock that is higher than I

Oh sometimes the shadows are deep
And rough seems the path to the goal
And sorrows sometimes how they sweep
Like tempests and over the soul
Oh then to the rock let me fly (let me fly)
To the rock that is higher than I (higher than I)
Oh then to the rock let me fly (let me fly)
To the rock that is higher than I

Lead on, O 
King eternal,
The day of 
march has 
come;
Henceforth in 
fields of 
conquest
Thy tents 
shall be our 
home.
Through days 
of 
preparation
Thy grace has 
made us 
strong;
And now, O 
King eternal,
We lift our 
battle song.

Lead them, 
my God, to 
Thee,
Lead them 
to Thee,
These 
children 
dear of 
mine,
Thou gavest 
me.
O, by Thy 
love 
divine,

Lead us, heavenly Father,
In our opening way,
Lead us in the morning
Of our little day.
While our hearts are happy,
While our souls are free,
May we give our childhood
As a song to Thee.

Step 
by 
step, 
O 
loving 
Savior,
In 
Thine 
own 
appointed 
way,
In 
the 
path 
which 
Thou 
hast 
chosen,
Lead 
us 
on, 
from 
day 
to 
day.

Lead us, heavenly Father,
In our opening way,
Lead us in the morning
Of our little day.
While our hearts are happy,
While our souls are free,
May we give our childhood
As a song to Thee.

Lead 
us, O 
Father, 
in the 
paths 
of 
peace:
Without 
Thy 
guiding 
hand we 
go 
astray,
And 
doubts 
appall, 
and 
sorrows 
still 
increase;
Lead us 
through 
Christ, 
the 
true 
and 
living 
way.

Leader of faithful souls, and guide
Of all that travel to the sky,
Come and with us, ev'n us, abide,
Who would on thee alone rely,
On thee alone our spirits stay,
While held in life's uneven way.
We've no abiding city here,
But seek a city out of sight;
Thither our steady course we steer,
Aspiring to the plains of light,
Jerusalem, the saints' abode,
Whose founder is the living God.
Through thee, who all our sins hast borne,
Freely and graciously forgiven,
With songs to Zion we return,
Contending for our native heaven;
That palace of our glorious King,
We find it nearer while we sing.
Raised by the breath of love divine,
We urge our way with strength renewed;
The church of the first-born to join,
We travel to the mount of God,
With joy upon our heads arise,
And meet our Captain in the skies.

Just 
lean 
upon 
the 
arms 
of 
Jesus,
He’ll 
help 
you 
along, 
help 
you 
along,
If 
you 
will 
trust 
His 
love 
unfailing,
He’ll 
fill 
your 
heart 
with 
song.

What 
a 
fellowship, 
what 
a 
joy 
divine,
Leaning 
on 
the 
everlasting 
arms;
What 
a 
blessedness, 
what 
a 
peace 
is 
mine,
Leaning 
on 
the 
everlasting 
arms.

If you're alone and oh so lonely
And you don't know what to do
Jesus will bear your heavy load
He'll give you relief from your burden
He'll give you rest for your soul
So just leave it all to Him

If the world from you withhold 
of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along with meager fare,
Just remember, in His Word, 
how He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.

Leave, shepherds, leave your peaceful flocks agrazing!
No longer grieve, but come, O come away!
Come and adore, your tears all changed to praising;
Of Him the heav’nly King, O sing, O sing
Your Savior born this happy day.

Leaving all to follow Jesus,
Turning from the world away,
Stepping out upon the promise,
All I have is His today.

My heart has come to the place of rest,
Leaving it all with Jesus;
The fear of death doth no more molest,
I'm leaving it all with Jesus.

In the light that Jesus sheds on you,
Thro’ many blessings day by day,
You can be His servant kind and true,
By leaving smiles along your way.

Their eyes are closed, they cannot see (Eyes are closed, they cannot see)
Their legalistic tendencies (Legalistic tendencies)
Their eyes are closed, they cannot see (Eyes are closed, they cannot see)
Their legalistic tendencies (Legalistic tendencies)

Let all creation bless the Lord,
till heaven with praise is ringing.
Sun, moon, and stars, peal out a chord,
stir up the angels' singing.
Sing, wind and rain! Sing, snow and sleet!
Make music, day, night, cold, and heat:
exalt the God who made you.
All living things upon this earth,
green fertile hills and mountains,
sing to the God who gave you birth;
be joyful, springs and fountains.
Lithe waterlife, bright airborne birds,
wild roving beasts, tame flocks and herds:
exalt the God who made you.
O men and women everywhere,
lift up a hymn of glory;
all you who know God's steadfast care,
tell our salvation's story.
No tongue be silent; sing your part,
you humble souls and meek of heart:
exalt the God who made you.

Let all mortal flesh keep silence,
And with fear and trembling stand;
Ponder nothing earthly minded,
For with blessing in His hand,
Christ our God to earth descendeth,
Our full homage to demand.

Let all on earth their voices raise,
Re-echoing Heav’n’s triumphant praise
To Him, Who gave th’apostles grace
To run on earth their glorious race.

Let all that breathe Jehovah praise;
Almighty, all-creating Lord!
Let earth and Heav’n His power confess,
Brought out of nothing by His word.

Let all the earth their voices raise
To sing the choicest psalm of praise,
To sing and bless Jehovah’s Name:
His glory let the heathens know,
His wonders to the nations show,
And all His saving works proclaim.

Let all the multitudes of light,
Their songs in concert raising,
With earth's triumphal hymns unite,
The risen Saviour praising.
Ye heavens, his festival proclaim!
Our King returneth whence he came,
With victory amazing.
For us he bore the bitter Tree,
To death's dark realm descending;
Our foe he slew, and set us free,
Man's ancient bondage ending.
No more the tyrant's chains oppress;
O conquering Love, thy name we bless,
With thee to heaven ascending.
Jesus, to thee be endless praise,
For this thy great salvation;
O holy Father, thine always
Be thanks and adoration;
Spirit of life and light, to thee
Eternal praise and glory be:
One God of all creation!

Let all things now 
living a song of thanksgiving
To God the creator triumphantly raise.
Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,
Who still guides us on to the end of our days.
God's banners are o'er us, His light goes before us,
A pillar of fire shining forth in the night.
Till shadows have vanished and darkness is banished
As forward we travel from light into light.
His law he enforces, the stars in their courses
And sun in its orbit obediently shine;
The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,
The deeps of the ocean proclaim him divine.
We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing;
With glad adoration a Song let us raise
Till all things now living unite in thanksgiving:
 "To God in the highest, Hosanna and praise!"

Let angels and archangels sing
The wonderful Immanuel’s Name,
Adore with us our new-born King,
And still the joyful news proclaim;
All earth and Heav’n be ever joined
To praise the Savior of mankind.

Let children hear the mighty deeds
Which God performed of old;
Which in our younger years we saw,
And which our fathers told.

Let Christian faith and hope dispel
The fears of guilt and woe;
The Lord Almighty is our Friend,
And who can prove a foe?

Let death dissolve my body now,
And bear my spirit home;
Why do my days move on so slow,
Nor my salvation come?
God has laid up in heav'n for me
A crown which can not fade;
The righteous Judge, at that great day
Shall place it on my head.
Jesus the Lord, shall guard me safe
From ev'ry ill design;
And to his heav'nly kingdom take
This feeble soul of mine.
God is my everlasting aid,
My portion, and my fiend;
To him be highest glory paid
In ages without end.

Let earth and heaven combine,
Angels and men agree,
To praise in songs divine
The incarnate Deity,
Our God contracted to a span,
Incomprehensibly made Man.

Let everlasting glories crown
Thy head, my Savior and my Lord;
Thy hands have brought salvation down,
And writ the blessings in Thy Word.

Let every lamp be burning bright,
The darkest hour is nearing;
The darkest hour of earth’s long night,
Before the Lord’s appearing.

Let every mortal ear attend,
And every heart rejoice;
The trumpet of the Gospel sounds
With an inviting voice.

Let every mortal ear attend,
And every heart rejoice;
The trumpet of the Gospel sounds
With an inviting voice.

Let glory be to God on high:
Peace be on earth as in the sky;
Good will to men! We bow the knee,
We praise, we bless, we worship Thee;
We give Thee thanks, Thy Name we sing,
Almighty Father! Heav’nly King!

Let God arise in all His might,
And put the troops of hell to flight,
As smoke that sought to cloud the skies
Before the rising tempest flies.

Let God arise, and by His might
Let all His foes be put to flight;
But O ye righteous, gladly sing,
Exult before your God and King.

Let hearts awaken, now the night is ended,
And raise their morning psalm of adoration,
In sweetest concert the Creator's glory
Joyfully singing.
So, with the anthems of the blest uniting,
May we find grace to win the courts celestial,
And hymn the praise of heaven's high King eternal
Through life unending.
Grant this, O Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Trinity blessed, who one Godhead sharest:
Thine be the glory through the whole creation
Now and for ever.

To thy barred and bolted door,
Gently as a wooing dove,
Jesus comes as oft before,
Pleading in His tender love.

There’s a Stranger at the door,
Let the Savior in, O let the Savior in;
He has been there oft before,
Let the Savior in, O let the Savior in.
Let Him in, ere He is gone;
Let Him in, the Holy One,
Jesus Christ the Father’s Son,
Let the Savior in, O let the Savior in.

Let Him to whom we now belong
His sovereign right assert,
And take up every thankful song,
And every loving heart.

The warmth
The love
The cleansing
From the blood
Let it flow
Let it flow

If you are tired of the load of your sin,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you desire a new life to begin,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

“Let little children come to Me,"
So says our blessed Lord;
And I, a little child, must be
Obedient to His Word;
On Sabbath days must sing His praise,
And bow before Him, for He says,
 “Let little children come to Me,
Let little children come."

Let love arise and praise him
Who came as Light from heaven,
And shines as light reflected
In souls of men forgiven:
Through the dimness of our shadows,
Through the mist he came;
For the souls of them that see him
Blessed be his name.
He cometh as the morning,
The light of day arisen,
To them that sit in darkness,
The souls of men in prison:
Blessed Light that deigns to visit
Man in his distress!
Welcome with thy wings of healing,
Sun of Righteousness!
Behold the sky at evening,
When day on earth is ending,
What clouds are seen at sunset
Upon the sun attending:
Where our sun is sinking from us
Into skies unknown,
All clouds aflame with glory
Where he passes on.
So, where our Christ advances,
The Lord of Life undying,
He goes with flashing trumpets
And pomp of banners flying;
Not in unattended glory,
Nor in lonely might:
Multitudes that none can number
Answer back his light.
A burning mist around him,
A flock of souls unending,
A cloud of flying spirits,
Ascending and descending,
Swimming on in light below him,
Soaring on above,
Who are these that move in rapture
Round about his love?
O these are souls that pitied,
Because they knew his pity,
And found him in their neighbour
And met him in their city;
These are they whose life among us
Won the weak from vice;
These are they, who little knowing,
Shared his sacrifice.
Through them he healed our wounded,
Through them he led our blindness,
Redeemed our unbelieving,
Atoned for our unkindness,
Therefore in the light they follow
Where the Lamb doth go;
Therefore shines their dazzling raiment
White as glistening snow.
So Christ his temple enters,
The Priest that was so wounded,
And makes a new atonement
As Love by love surrounded:
Love amazing that transfigures
Where its light has shone,
Love that burns upon the altar,
Love that mounts the throne.

Let me be Thine forever, Thou faithful God and Lord;
Let me forsake Thee never, nor wander from Thy Word.
Lord, do not let me waver, but give me steadfastness,
And for such grace forever Thy holy Name I’ll bless.

Let me be with thee where thou art,
my Savior, my eternal rest;
then only will this longing heart
be fully and for ever blessed.
Let me be with thee where thou art,
thy unveiled glory to behold;
then only will this wandering heart
cease to be treacherous, faithless, cold.
Let me be with thee where thou art,
where spotless saints thy Name adore:
then only will this sinful heart
be evil and defiled no more.
Let me be with thee where thou art,
where none can die, where none remove;
then neither death nor life will part
me from thy presence and thy love.

Let me dwell on Golgotha,
Weep and love my life away!
While I see Him on the tree
Weep and bleed, and die for me!

When my way is hedged about me, hedged with thorns of care;
When the cross I loved so dearly, seems too hard to bear;
When my heart is bowed with sorrow, and no light I see—
Lord, Thy tender mercy pleading, let me lean on Thee.

Imagine a scene in Heaven you know it's a sunny day
All the angel band together working to perfect their play
Then comes the announcement from way across the sea
It's another bithday everybody to your feet

Free your mind
Let Me show you, let Me show you
Let Me show you Me

Let Me show you, let Me show you
Let Me show you Me
Well I know you've heard about Me
Who I am, about divinity
And I'm sure you think you know Me
For all the things you've read about Me
Oh, but I'm trying hard to show you Me
Standing before you so that you can see
I am more than written pages
Free your mind of all its cages
Come along and stand beside Me
You need your heart to see Me clearly
Oh but there's so much more you need to know
With eyes of a child to see what I will show

I'm looking at you old friend of mine
It's no use pretending that everything's fine
Now don't be so brave, don't be so proud
I want you to know that I'm here for you now
I can see you hurting and it's hurting me
It doesn't have to be this way

Let not the wise his wisdom boast,
The mighty glory in his might,
The rich in flattering riches trust,
Which take their everlasting flight.

Let our choir new anthems raise, wake the morn with gladness;
God Himself to joy and praise turns the martyrs’ sadness:
Bright the day that won their crown, opened heav’ns bright portal,
As they laid the mortal down and put on th’immortal.

Let party names no more
The Christian world o’erspread;
Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,
Are one in Christ, their Head.

Let saints on earth in concert sing
With those whose work is done;
For all the servants of our King
In Heav’n and earth are one.

Let sighing cease and woe
God from on high hath heard,
Heaven’s gate is opening wide, and lo!
The long expected Word.

Let sinners take their course,
And choose the road to death
But in the worship of my God
I'll spend my daily breath.
My thoughts address his throne
When morning brings the light;
I'll seek his blessing every noon,
And pay my vows at night.
Thou wilt regard my cries,
O my eternal God,
While sinners perish in surprise,
Beneath thine angry rod.
Because they dwell at ease,
And no sad changes feel,
They neither fear nor trust thy name,
Nor learn to do thy will.
But I with all my cares
Will lean upon the Lord;
I'll cast my burdens on his arm,
And rest upon his word.
His arm shall well sustain
The children of his love;
The ground on which their safety stands,
No earthly power can move.

Let Sion and her sons rejoice,
Behold the promised hour;
Her God hath heard her mourning voice,
And comes t’exalt His power.

Let songs of praise arise
To God at early morn,
When golden beams from eastern skies
The mountain peaks adorn.

Let songs of praises fill the sky:
Christ, our ascended Lord,
Sends down His Spirit from on high
According to His Word.
All hail the day of Pentecost,
The coming of the Holy Ghost!

Would you always cheerful be,
Let the blessed sunlight in;
Would you bid the darkness flee,
Let the blessed sunlight in.

Let the earth now praise the Lord.
Who hath truly kept His Word
And the sinners’ Help and Friend
Now at last to us doth send.

Would you be redeemed from ev’ry inbred sin,
Have the Holy Spirit constantly within?
Make the consecration, trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

O, let the light stream in,
The glorious light of day,
That o’er the face of nature sheds
A bright and genial ray;
We need its beams our steps to guide,
Ere daily toils begin,
Then open wide the door of prayer,
And let the light stream in.
Let the light stream in,
Let the light stream in,
Then open wide the door of prayer,
And let the light stream in.

Brightly beams our Father’s mercy from His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping of the lights along the shore.
Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam across the wave!
For to us He gives the keeping of the lights along the shore.
 [

Let the round world with songs rejoice;
Let Heaven return the joyful voice;
All mindful of th’Apostles’ fame,
Let Heav’n and earth their praise proclaim.

Let the seventh angel sound on high,
Let shouts be heard through all the sky;
Kings of the earth, with glad accord,
Give up your kingdoms to the Lord.

Let the song go round the earth,
Jesus Christ is Lord!
Sound His praises, tell His worth,
Be His Name adored;
Every clime and every tongue
Join the grand, the glorious song!

Do you fear the foe will in the conflict win?
Is it dark without you—darker still within?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in.

Let the world their virtue boast,
Their works of righteousness,
I, a wretch undone and lost,
Am freely saved by grace;
Other title I disclaim;
This, only this, is all my plea:
I the chief of sinners am,
But Jesus died for me.

Let there be light, Lord God of hosts,
Let there be wisdom on the earth;
Let broad humanity have birth,
Let there be deeds, instead of boasts.

Once there was love long ago
Sweet innocence long ago

Out of our hearts out of our world
Then Someone came in the night
Came to lead men to the light
Turn us around make us right
Bring love to our hearts love to the world

Let thine example, holy John, remind us,
Ere we can meetly sing thy deeds of wonder,
Hearts must be chastened, and the bonds that bind us
Broken asunder!

Let thoughtless thousands choose the road
That leads the soul away from God;
This happiness, dear Lord, be mine,
To live and die entirely Thine.

Let thy Blood in mercy poured,
let thy gracious Body broken,
be to me, O gracious Lord,
of thy boundless love the token.

Let us all with with gladsome voice
Praise the God of Heaven,
Who, to bid our hearts rejoice,
His own Son hath given.

Let us ever walk with Jesus,
Follow His example pure,
Flee the world, which would deceive us
And to sin our souls allure.
Ever in His footsteps treading,
Body here, yet soul above,
Full of faith and hope and love,
Let us do the Father's bidding.
Faithful Lord, abide with me;
Savior, lead, I follow Thee.

Let us love and sing and wonder,
Let us praise the Savior’s Name!
He has hushed the law’s loud thunder,
He has quenched Mount Sinai’s flame.
He has washed us with His blood,
He has brought us nigh to God.

Let us love and sing and wonder,
Let us praise the Savior’s Name!
He has hushed the law’s loud thunder,
He has quenched Mount Sinai’s flame.
He has washed us with His blood,
He has brought us nigh to God.

Let us now our voices raise, 
wake the day with gladness;
God himself to joy and praise 
turns our human sadness:
joy that martyrs won their crown, 
opened heaven's bright portal,
when they laid the mortal down 
for the life immortal.
Never flinched they from the flame, 
from the torture never;
vain the foeman's sharpest aim, 
vain each fierce endeavor:
for by faith they saw the land 
decked in all its glory,
where triumphant now they stand 
with the victor's story.
Up and follow, Christian men! 
Press through toil and sorrow;
Spurn the night of fear, and then, 
O the glorious morrow!
Who will venture on the strife?
Who will first begin it!
Who will grasp the land of life?
Warriors, up and win it!

Let us plead for faith alone
Faith which by our works is shown;
God it is Who justifies,
Only faith the grace applies.

Let us rise in early morning,
And, instead of ointments, bring
Hymns of praises to our Master,
And His Resurrection sing:
We shall see the Sun of Justice
Ris’n with healing on His wing,
Ris’n with healing on His wing.

Day when Heav’n and earth unite in songs of gladness,
Triumph telling, o’er the tomb;
Day when mourning ones can banish all their sadness,
Songs upswelling, where was gloom.

Let us thank the Christ for all who did their duty,
Famous men of old and great of heart in fight;
Who fought their way and laboured for their day,
And strove to make our England
A happy, lovely England,
Happy in his praise and lovely in his light.
Now they thank the Christ who called them to be captains;
Now they sing his praise in everlasting light;
And still they pray, they pray the Lord to-day
That he would make our England
A happy, lovely England,
Happy in his praise and lovely in his light.
Let us pray the Christ that he would make us soldiers
Truer in his ways and braver in his fight;
That we, as they, may loyally obey,
And help to make our England
A happy, lovely England,
Happy in his praise and lovely in his light.

Let us then approach the throne (Let us then approach the throne)
Let us then approach the throne (Let us then approach the throne)
The throne of grace (with confidence)
Let us then approach the throne (Let us then approach the throne)
Let us then approach the throne (Let us then approach the throne)
The throne of grace (with confidence) So that we may receive mercy
Mercy, mercy
And find grace to help us in our time of need

There is a Light, a blessed Light,
That comes from God above;
And in the face of Christ the Lord,
Reflects the Father’s love.

Let us, with a gladsome mind,
Praise the Lord, for He is kind.

Let worldly minds the World Pursue
It has no charms for me;
Once I admired its trifles too,
But grace has set me free.
Its pleasures now no longer please,
No more content afford;
Far from my heart be joys like these;
Since I have known the Lord.
As by the light of op'ning day
The stars are all concealed,
So earthly pleasures fade away
When Jesus is revealed.
Creatures no more divide my choice,
I bid them all depart;
His name, and love, and gracious voice
Have fixed my roving heart.
Now, Lord, I would be thine alone,
And wholly live to thee;
But may I hope that thou wilt own
A worthless worm like me?
Yes! Though of sinners I'm the worst,
I can not doubt thy will;
For if thou hadst not loved me first,
I had refused thee still.

Let Your 
glory fall in this room
Let it go forth from here to the nations
Let Your fragrance rest in this place
As we gather to seek Your face
Ruler of the nations, the world has yet to see
The full release of Your promise
The Church in victory
Turn to us Lord and touch us
Make us strong in Your might
Overcome our weakness
That we could stand up and fight

Sing to 
Jesus.
Jesus, O Jesus.Jesus, Jesus
(Spirit, Father)
Come now Holy Spirit and take control
Hold me in Your loving arms
And make me whole
Wipe away all doubts and fears
And take my pride
Draw me to Your love
And keep me by Your side
Give your life to Jesus
Let Him fill your soul
Let Him take you in His arms
And make you whole
As you give your life to Him
He sets you free
You will live and reign with Him eternally

Let your mindset be the same
As that of Jesus Christ;
Though in very nature God,
He did not cling to his rights.

Let Zion’s watchmen all awake
And take th’alarm they give;
Now let them, from the mouth of God
Their awful charge receive.

Let's Be Christians, Christians only (only)
Serving Jesus, our only plea
If we'd all give up to the precious Son (to the Son)
We could all be one, that's what we need

What happened to the dream we new
Everybody having something to live for
Seems we've forgotten where we're going to
And all the reasons for the things we do
And we just stack another stone in place
Until the walls we're facing seem so high
Sometimes it's enough to make you cry
It's time to dry your weepin' eyes

There are too many Christians
Who don't talk to each other
They're not acting like brothers
They're not loving at all
They' refuse confrontation
They choose gossip and slander
For solutions meander
Well they're in for a fall

Let's go dreamin'

Let's Just Praise the Lord, 
Praise the Lord.
Let's Just Lift Our Hands Toward Heaven,
And Praise the Lord.
Let's Just Praise the Lord, 
Praise the Lord.
Let's Just Lift Our Hands Toward Heaven
And Praise the Lord.

I've got some news cause I know that you care
When were you gonna tell me?
These news gotta be the best I ever could share
When were you gonna tell me?
I met the Lord, I know the Son
My life is reconstructed and my soul has been won
It's a new day - knowing His way
I'm forgiven and I'm going to heaven
I see you're pleased 'bout the news that you've heard
When were you gonna tell me?
The change I've had since I've learned of His Word
When were you gonna tell me? 
He saw my need, He took me in
Now I am depending on my heavenly Friend
It's a new day - knowing His way
I'm forgiven and I'm going to heaven

Let's sing praises to God
Praises to God
Clap your hands together and sing
Praises to God
Let's sing praises to God
Praises to God
And listen to His mighty voice

I’ve come that you might
Have life more abundantly
I’ve come that you might (have life)
Have life more abundantly

My soul is joyful in the Lord;
His light shines all around;
For Jesus is my life, my way;
His love in me abounds.

Life and light and joy are found
In the presence of the Lord:
Life with richest blessing crowned,
Light from many fountains poured -
Life and light and holy joy,
None can darken or destroy.
Bring to him life's brightest hours,
He will make them still more bright;
Give to him your noblest powers,
He will hallow all your might;
Come to him with eager quest,
You shall hear his high behest.
All your questions large and deep,
All the open thoughts of youth,
Bring to him, and you shall reap
All the harvest of his truth;
You shall find in that great store
Largest love and wisest lore.
Then when comes life's wider sphere
And its busier enterprise,
You shall find him ever near,
Looking, with approving eyes,
On all honest work and true
His dear servants' hands can do.

Life and strength of all Thy servants,
Brightness of the Father’s light;
Men with angels, earth with Heaven,
In Thy praise their songs unite.

For God so loved the world
He gave His only son
That whosoever believes in Him
Shall never perish but receive
Life eternal
Life eternal

Children of yesterday, heirs of tomorrow,
What are you weaving? labor and sorrow?
Look to your loom again, faster and faster
Fly the great shuttles prepared by the Master.
There’s life in the loom! Room for it, room!
There’s life in the loom! Room for it, room!

Life is like a mountain 
railroad, with an engineer that’s brave;
We must make the run successful, from the cradle to the 
grave;
Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels; never falter, 
never quail;
Keep your hand upon the throttle, and your eye upon the 
rail.
Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us,
Till we reach that blissful shore;
Where the angels wait to join us
In Thy praise forevermore.
You will roll up grades of trial; you will cross the 
bridge of strife;
See that Christ is your Conductor on this lightning 
train of life;
Always mindful of obstruction, do your duty, never 
fail;
Keep your hand upon the throttle, and your eye upon the 
rail.
Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us,
Till we reach that blissful shore;
Where the angels wait to join us
In Thy praise forevermore.
You will often find obstructions; look for storms of 
wind and rain;
On a fill, or curve, or trestle, they will almost ditch 
your train;
Put your trust alone in Jesus; never falter, never 
fail;
Keep your hand upon the throttle, and your eye upon the 
rail.
Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us,
Till we reach that blissful shore;
Where the angels wait to join us
In Thy praise forevermore.
As you roll across the trestle, spanning Jordan’s 
swelling tide,
You behold the Union Depot into which your train will 
glide;
There you’ll meet the Superintendent, God the Father, 
God the Son,
With the hearty, joyous, plaudit, “Weary pilgrim, 
welcome home!"
Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us,
Till we reach that blissful shore;
Where the angels wait to join us
In Thy praise forevermore.

Life is the time to serve the Lord,
The time to ensure the great reward;
And while the lamp holds out to burn,
The vilest sinner may return.

Life of ages, richly poured,
Love of God, unspent and free,
Flowing in the prophet’s word,
And the people’s liberty.

The light of God is falling,
Upon life’s common way;
The Master’s voice is calling,
“Come, walk with Me today";
No duty can seem lowly
To him who lives with Thee,
And all of life grows holy,
O Christ of Galilee!

The life, which God’s Incarnate Word
Lived here below with men,
Three blest evangelists record
With Heav’n inspired pen.

(Opening lines are spoken as a sermon- "John 10")
I am the door
By me if any man enter in he shall be saved
And shall go in and out and find pasture
The thief cometh not but for to steal
And kill and to destroy
But I have come that they might life!
And that they might have it more abundantly

Life-Giver wo.

Life is like a mountain railroad, with an engineer that’s brave;
We must make the run successful, from the cradle to the grave;
Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels; never falter, never quail;
Keep your hand upon the throttle, and your eye upon the rail.

Lift every voice and sing, till earth and Heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise, high as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Lift Him up, ’tis He that bids you,
Let the dying look and live,
To all weary, thirsting sinners,
Living waters will He give;
And though once so meek and lowly,
Yet the Prince of Heav’n was He;
And the blind, who grope in darkness,
Through the blood of Christ shall see.

How to reach the masses, men of every birth,
For an answer, Jesus gave the key:
 “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me."

Lift the strain of high thanksgiving!
Tread with songs the hallowed way!
Praise our fathers’ God for mercies
New to us their sons today:
Here they built for Him a dwelling,
Served Him here in ages past,
Fixed it for His sure possession,
Holy ground, while time shall last.

Is thy heart oppressed with sorrow?
Lift thy face to the light;
Dost thou dread a dark tomorrow?
Lift thy face to the light.
Still it shines unfailingly,
Just beyond the clouds for thee,
Love’s clear light, so full and free,
Lift thy face to the light.

Lift up my soul (lift up my soul)
Bring joy to your servant
Lift up my soul (lift up my soul)
And exalt you the King
Lift up my soul (lift up my soul)
Bring joy to your servant
Lift up my soul (lift up my soul)
For you are the ruler over everything


Lift up thyself, my soul,
Above this world’s control!
Spend and be spent in holy hymns of praise.
Be armed with pure desire,
Burn with celestial fire;
Unto the King of kings our voice we raise;
To Him a crown we weave, and bring
A sacrifice of words, a bloodless offering.

Lift up to God the voice of praise,
Whose breath our souls inspired;
Loud and more loud the anthem raise,
With grateful ardor fired.

Lift up 
your head to fight
And be My warrior to shine My light
Lift up your voice and proclaim
The words of power that exalt My name
The words of power that exalt My name
Every child of Mine can be strong
The power is yours for the taking
The demons that held you so long
You can grind beneath your feet

Lift up your heads, rejoice, redemption draweth nigh;
Now breathes a softer air, now shines a milder sky;
The early trees put forth their new and tender leaf;
Hushed is the moaning wind that told of winter’s grief.

Lift up your heads, ye gates of brass,
Ye bars of iron, yield,
And let the King of Glory pass;
The cross is in the field.
That banner, brighter than the star
That leads the train of night,
Shines on their march, and guides from far
His servants to the fight.

Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates;
Behold, the King of glory waits;
The King of kings is drawing near;
The Savior of the world is here!

“Lift up your hearts!" We lift them, Lord, to Thee;
Here at Thy feet none other may we see;
“Lift up your hearts!" E’en so, with one accord,
We lift them up, we lift them to the Lord.

Lift up your voice, ye Christian folk,
To praise the Holy One,
Who ransoms us from Satan's yoke
Through Christ, his blessed Son.
Lo, we who were in grievous state
By reason of our sin,
Our heads look up, our fears abate,
Our triumphs now begin.
The mists hung cold, the night was black,
About the way we trod;
Our feet were stumbling from the track
Which leads the soul to God.
But Christ, who broke from death's dark shroud,
Hath sent his quickening ray:
The sun breaks through the drifting cloud,
And now 'tis glorious day.
Lift up your voice! with shout and song
Extol his majesty,
Whose power hath made the feeble strong
And caused the blind to see.
And when the sound of praise grows dim
Still may our lives forth tell,
In all we do, our love of him
Who doeth all things well.

Lift up, lift up thy voice with singing,
Dear land, with strength lift up thy voice!
The kingdoms of the earth are bringing
Their treasures to thy gates—Rejoice!

Lift up, lift up your voices now!
The whole wide world rejoices now;
The Lord has triumphed gloriously,
The Lord shall reign victoriously.

Lift your glad voices in triumph on high,
For Jesus hath risen, and man cannot die;
Vain were the terrors that gathered around Him,
And short the dominion of death and the grave;
He burst from the fetters of darkness that bound Him,
Resplendent in glory to live and to save!
Loud was the of angels on high,
The Savior hath risen, and man shall not die.

Lift your heads, ye friends of Jesus,
Partners in His sufferings here;
Christ, to all believers precious,
Lord of lords, shall soon appear:
Mark the tokens of His heavenly kingdom near!

Lift your voice rejoicing, Mary,
Christ has risen from the tomb;
on the cross a suffering victim,
now as victor he is come.
Whom your tears in death were mourning,
welcome with your smiles returning.
Let your alleluias rise!
Raise your weary eyelids, Mary,
see him living evermore;
see his countenance how gracious,
see the wounds for you he bore.
All the glory of the morning
pales before those wounds redeeming.
Let your alleluias rise!
Life is yours for ever, Mary,
for your light is come once more
and the strength of death is broken;
now your songs of joy outpour.
Ended now the night of sorrow, 
love has brought the blessed morrow.
Let your alleluias rise.

A light came out of darkness;
No light, no hope had we,
Till Jesus came from Heaven
Our light and hope to be.
Oh, as I read the story
From birth to dying cry,
A longing fills my bosom
To meet Him by and by.

Light in the eastern sky, Jesus returning!
Light in the western sky, Jesus is near!
Soon shall the nations, His advent discerning,
Hail Him with gladness, or see Him with fear.

The light of God is falling,
Upon life’s common way;
The Master’s voice is calling,
“Come, walk with Me today";
No duty can seem lowly
To him who lives with Thee,
And all of life grows holy,
O Christ of Galilee!

Light of Light, enlighten me,
Now anew the day is dawning;
Sun of grace, the shadows flee;
Brighten Thou my Sabbath morning;
With Thy joyous sunshine blest,
Happy is my day of rest.

Light of the Gentile nations,
Thy people’s joy and love,
Dawn by Thy Spirit hither,
We gladly come to prove
Thy presence in Thy temple,
And wait with earnest mind,
As Simeon once had waited
His Savior God to find.

Light of the lonely pilgrim’s heart,
Star of the coming day,
Arise, and with Thy morning beams
Chase all our griefs away.

Light of the minds that know him,
may Christ be light to mine!
My sun in risen splendor,
my light of truth divine;
my guide in doubt and darkness,
my true and living way,
my clear light ever shining,
my dawn of heaven's day.
Life of the souls that love him,
may Christ be ours indeed!
The living Bread from heaven
on whom our spirits feed;
who died for love of sinners
to bear our guilty load,
and make of life's journey
a new Emmaus road.
Strength of the wills that serve him,
may Christ be strength to me,
who stilled the storm and tempest,
who calmed the tossing sea;
his Spirit's power to move me,
his will to master mine,
his cross to carry daily
and conquer in his sign.
May it be ours to know him
that we may truly love,
and loving, fully serve him
as serve the saints above;
till in that home of glory
with fadeless splendor bright,
we serve in perfect freedom
our strength, our life, our light.

Light of the world! Faint were our weary feet
With wand’ring far;
But Thou didst come, our lonely heart to greet,
Our Morning Star;
And Thou didst bid us lift our gaze on high
And see the glory of the glowing sky.

The whole world was lost
In the darkness of sin,
The Light of the world is Jesus!
Like sunshine at noonday,
His glory shone in.
The Light of the world is Jesus!

Light of the world! forever, ever shining,
There is no change in Thee;
True Light of life, all joy and health enshrining,
Thou canst not fade nor flee.

Light of the world, we hail Thee, flushing the eastern skies;
Never shall darkness veil Thee again from human eyes;
Too long, alas, withholden, now spread from shore to shore;
Thy light, so glad and golden, shall set on earth no more.

Light of the world’s dark story,
Jesus, Thy Name we praise;
Thou art the Lord of glory,
The brightness of our days.
We would go singing, singing,
Along our pilgrim road,
With love and hope upwinging,
Haste to our fixed abode.

Light of those whose dreary dwelling
Borders on the shades of death,
Come, and by Thy love’s revealing
Dissipate the clouds beneath.

Have you ever looked up at the moon
And wondered why it glows
Have you thought about who put it there
And the wisdom that he shows
I’ll ask my dad about it
What made it work that way
And here is what he told me
I can hear my daddy say

I stand 
before You,

Lighten the darkness of our life’s long night,
Through which we blindly stumble to the day,
Shadows mislead us; Father, send Thy light
To set our footsteps in the homeward way.

There's a Lighthouse on the hillside
That over looks life's sea
When I'm tossed it sends out a light
That I might see
And the light that shines in darkness now
Will safely lead us o'er
If it wasn't for the Lighthouse
My ship would be no more

Light’s abode, celestial Salem,
Vision whence true peace doth spring,
Brighter than the heart can fancy,
Mansion of the highest King;
O how glorious are the praises
Which of thee the prophets sing!

Light’s glittering morn bedecks the sky;
Heav’n thunders forth its victor cry;
The glad earth shouts her triumph high,
And groaning hell makes wild reply.

O the friends that now are waiting,
In the cloudless realms of day,
Who are calling me to follow
Where their steps have led the way;
They have laid aside their armor,
And their earthly course is run;
They have kept the faith with patience
And their crown of life is won.

Savior, like a bird to Thee,
Weary and wounded my soul would flee;
O let me fold my wings and rest
Peacefully, trustingly, on Thy breast.

Where He leads me I must 
follow
Without Him I'd lose my way
I will see a bright tomorrow
If I follow Him today
Like a lamb who needs the Shepherd
At His side I'll always stay
Through the night His strength I'll borrow
Then I'll see another day
Life is like a winding pathway
Who can tell what lies ahead?
Will it lead to shady pastures,
Or to wilderness instead?
Like a lamb who needs the Shepherd
When into the night I go
Help me find the path that's narrow
While I travel here below
Though you walk through darkest valleys
And the sky is cold and gray
Though you climb the steepest mountains
He will never let you stray
Like a lamb who needs the Shepherd
By your side He'll always stay
 'Til the end of life's long journey
He will lead you all the way

My soul today is thirsting for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest Heaven to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, in Jesus’ Name I plead;
O send the gracious current to satisfy my need.

Like a river glorious, is God’s perfect peace,
Over all victorious, in its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth, fuller every day,
Perfect, yet it groweth, deeper all the way.

Like a wayward child I wandered
From my Father’s house away,
But I hear His voice entreating,
And I’m coming home today.

When silent falls the gushing tear,
O’er cheeks grown pale with care;
And on the heart a cross is laid
That seems too hard to bear,
Remember what our Lord has said,
And trust, in weal or woe,
His holy Word, that changeth not,
Though uttered years ago.

“Like as a mother comforteth"
O words of gentle worth!
“So will I comfort you," declares
The Lord of all the earth.

I wanna be, I wanna be like my Daddy (just like my Dad)
I wanna be, I wanna be like my Daddy

Like sheep we went astray,
And broke the fold of God,
Each wandering in a different way,
But all the downward road.

Like silver lamps in a distant shrine,
The stars are sparkling bright;
The bells of the city of God ring out,
For the Son of Mary is born tonight.
The gloom is past, and the morn at last
Is coming with orient light.

Like the golden sun ascending,
Breaking through the gloom of night,
On the earth His glory spending
So that darkness takes to flight,
Thus my Jesus from the grave
And death’s dismal, dreadful cave
Rose triumphant Easter morning
At the early purple dawning.

Like the murmur of the dove's song,
like the challenge of her flight,
like the vigor of the wind's rush,
like the new flame's eager might:
come, Holy Spirit, come.
To the members of Christ's Body,
to the branches of the Vine,
to the Church in faith assembled,
to her midst as gift and sign:
come, Holy Spirit, come.
With the healing of division,
with the ceaseless voice of prayer,
with the power of love and witness,
with the peace beyond compare:
come, Holy Spirit, come.

Like the sound of many waters
Rolling on through ages long;
In a tide of rapture breaking—
Hark! the mighty choral song!

Lord we want to be like you and follow in Your ways
Lord we want to serve You and lift Your name in praise
Lord we want to set our hearts onto our heavenly home
Lord we want to give our lives to make Your will our own

All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion’s mount,
By many ages proved.

Like Zion’s steadfast mount are they
Who in the Lord confide;
Secure, immovable they stand,
Forever to abide.

have found a friend in Jesus, He’s everything to me,
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
In sorrow He’s my comfort, in trouble He’s my stay;
He tells me every care on Him to roll.

How sweetly o’er the mountain of Zion, lovely Zion,
The anthem of ages comes sweeping along;
The anthem of the faithful, we hear, and, rejoicing,
Our hearts in glad measure keep tune with the song.

The lion that on Sampson roared,
And thirsted for his blood;
With honey afterwards was stored,
And furnished him with food.

Peter went with James and John
Jesus led them to a mountain
A voice from heaven said
A voice from heaven said to them
 "Listen to Him"

How do you explain
How do you describe
A love that flows from east to west
And runs as deep as it is wide
You know all our hopes
Lord, you know all our fears
And words cannot express the love we feel
But we long for you to hear

Listen to the blessed invitation,
Sweeter than the notes of angel song,
Chiming softly with a heav’nly cadence,
Calling to the passing throng.

Listen, frightened spirits, hear! 
Christ has spoken loud and clear:
 'Through all tempest, pain and fear,
You shall not be overcome.'
When you agonize and grieve,
Call to mind his cross, believe
Love like this will not deceive.
You shall not be overcome.
Though you suffer grievous ill,
Dare to trust his promise still;
Sure, in God's unchanging will,
You shall not be overcome.
In your trouble and distress,
Though your faith grow less and less,
Grounded in Christ's faithfulness,
You shall not be overcome.
Word of Life, once crucified,
Resurrected Love, who died,
Held for ever at your side,
We shall not be overcome!

Listen, Lordings, unto me, a tale I will you tell;
Which, as on this night of glee, in David’s town befel.
Joseph came from Nazareth, with Mary that sweet maid:
Weary they were, nigh to death; and for a lodging prayed.

Do you know the world is dying
For a little bit of love?
Everywhere we hear the sighing
For a little bit of love;
For the love that rights a wrong,
Fills the heart with hope and song;
They have waited, oh, so long,
For a little bit of love.
For a little bit of love,
For a little bit of love,
They have waited, oh, so long,
For a little bit of love,

There’s a church in the valley by the wildwood,
No lovelier spot in the dale;
No place is so dear to my childhood,
As the little brown church in the vale.

The little cares which fretted me,
I lost them yesterday
Among the fields, above the sea,
Among the winds at play;
Among the lowing of the herds,
The rustling of the trees,
Among the singing of the birds,
The humming of the bees.

A little Child is born tonight,
And He shall lead His own,
To endless day, to glory bright,
To lands of everlasting light,
And to our Father’s throne.
A little Child is born tonight,
And in the starry sky,
To Him the angels carols bring:
"Good will and peace to men,“ they sing,
"Glory to God on high,
Glory to God on high.“

A little Child the Savior came,
The Mighty God was still His Name;
And angels worshiped as He lay
The seeming Infant of a day.

Little children, can you tell,
Do you know the story well,
Every girl and every boy,
Why the angels sing for joy,
On the Christmas morning.

Little children, rise and sing,
 (Ring the bells of Christmas)
 ’Tis the birthday of our King,
Blessed Child of Christmas.

Little drops of water,
little grains of sand,
make the mighty ocean
and the beauteous land.
And the little moments,
humble though they may be,
make the mighty ages
of eternity.
Little deeds of kindness,
little words of love,
make our earth an Eden,
like the heaven above.
So our little errors
lead the soul away,
from the paths of virtue
into sin to stray.
Little seeds of mercy
sown by youthful hands,
grow to bless the nations
far in heathen lands.
Glory then for ever
be to God on high,
beautiful and loving,
to eternity.

Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His name
Never read her His word
Two non-believers walking lost in this world
Took their baby with them
What a sad little girl

In the harvest field now ripened
There’s a work for all to do;
Hark! the voice of God is calling
To the harvest calling you.

A little kingdom I possess,
Where thoughts and feelings dwell,
And very hard I find the task
Of governing it well;
For passion tempts and troubles me,
A wayward will misleads,
And selfishness its shadow casts,
On all my will and deeds.

Little lamb, who made thee?
Dost thou know who made thee,
Gave thee life, and bade thee feed
By the stream and o’er the mead;
Gave thee clothing of delight,
Softest clothing, wooly, bright;
Gave thee such a tender voice,
Making all the vales rejoice?
Little lamb, who made thee?
Dost thou know who made thee?

I think God gives the children, as through the land they go,
The most delightful mission that anyone can know.
He wants us to be sunbeams of love and hope and cheer,
To brighten up the shadows that often gather here.

A little that the righteous hold
Is better than the wealth untold
Of many wicked men;
Destroyed shall be their arm of pride,
But they who in the Lord confide
Shall be upholden then.

Little travelers Zionward
Each one entering into rest,
In the kingdom of your Lord,
In the mansions of the blest:
There, to welcome, Jesus waits,
Gives the crown His followers win;
Lift your heads, ye golden gates,
Let the little travelers in!

Oh, for the peace that floweth as a river,
Making life’s desert places bloom and smile;
Oh, for the faith to grasp “Heav’n’s bright forever,"
Amid the shadows of earth’s “little while."

Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings!
Be Thou Thyself the answer to all my questionings;
Live out Thy life within me, in all things have Thy way!
I, the transparent medium, Thy glory to display.

Livin' inside, livin' inside of 
Livin' inside, livin' inside of me (repeated throughout echoed verses)

Oh Lord, (I used to wonder why) I used to wonder why you didn't seem as 
obvious as you could be (you could be)
And Lord, (then I began) then I began to understand you called this heart 
of mine
To keep Your light (keep your light) shinin' right through me
Because You've given me this life that I'm unworthy of (I am not worthy of 
your love)
And even when I take a fall You hold me out of love for me (you hold me 
out)
Since my existence is a gift that I've been given (been given) from above

Sittin' in the pews with a frown (frown), where is God?
Sing but ain't happy, others lookin' on at your facade
Unless you're showin' how you feel
People will never know that He's real
So get up off your padding and declare
He's the Lord!

Living for Jesus—O what peace!
Rivers of pleasure never cease.
Trials may come, yet I’ll not fear.
Living for Jesus, He is near.

Living for Jesus, a life that is true,
Striving to please Him in all that I do;
Yielding allegiance, glad hearted and free,
This is the pathway of blessing for me.

Living Lord of love's dominion,
sovereign Savior, bless your church;
call us still as your disciples--
loving, serving, while we search.
Gathered: feed our deepest being
prophet's truth and godly nerve;
scattered: let our lives' frustration
nourish others while we serve.
Visit towns and inner cities;
penetrate our steel and stone
with a love that melts our coldness,
making mission here our own.
We will seek you, love transfigured,
in our neighbor's need until
deep within our daily service
love draws forth our utmost skill.
With your bread, your wine, your Spirit,
nurture us for your intent;
let your will be our vocation
lived as song and sacrament.
May compassion lead to service
till we join the saints above;
grant us hope for each tomorrow;
fill our faith with vibrant love!

A living stream, as crystal clear,
Welling from out the throne,
Of God and of the Lamb on high,
The Lord to man hath shown.

There are more than a million things to bow to and to idol
A world that needs you more today to worship and to follow
I lean on You my Firm Foundation through life's many struggles
Build me up and fill my cup and make me strong for tomorrow

I've cast my heavy burdens down on Canaan's happy shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
I'll wander in the wilderness of doubt and sin no more;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

Lo, many shall come from the East and the West
And sit at the feast of salvation
With Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the blest,
Obeying the Lord's invitation.
Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

Lo! the pilgrim magi
leave their royal halls,
and with eager footsteps
speed to Bethlehem's walls;
as they onward journey,
faith, which firmly rests,
built on hope unswerving,
triumphs in their breasts.
O what joy and gladness
filled each heart, from far
when, to guide their footsteps,
shone that radiant star;
o'er that home so holy,
pouring down its ray,
where the cradled infant
with his mother lay.
Costly pomp and splendor
earthly kings array;
he, a mightier Monarch,
hath a nobler sway;
straw may be his pallet,
mean his garb may be,
yet with power transcendent
he all hearts can free.
At his crib they worship,
kneeling on the floor,
and their God there present,
in that Babe adore;
to our God and Savior
we, as Gentiles true,
give our heart o'erflowing,
give our tribute due.
Bringing of our substance,
gold unto our King;
pure and chastened bodies
to our Christ we bring;
unto him, like incense,
vow and prayer address;
so with meetest offerings,
him our God confess.
Glory to the Father,
Fount of Life alone;
who unto the Gentiles,
made his glory known.
Equal praise and glory,
blessed Son, to thee,
and to thee, blest Spirit,
evermore shall be.

Lo! what a cloud of witnesses
encompass us around!
Men once like us with suffering tried,
but now with glory crowned.
Let us, with zeal like theirs inspired,
strive in the Christian race;
and, freed from every weight of sin,
their holy footsteps trace.
Behold a Witness nobler still,
who trod affliction's path:
Jesus, the author, finisher,
rewarder of our faith.
He, for the joy before him set,
and moved by pitying love,
endured the cross, despised the shame,
and now he reigns above.
Thither, forgetting things behind,
press we to God's right hand;
there, with the Savior and his saints,
triumphantly to stand.

Lo, a loving Friend is waiting,
He is calling thee;
Listen to His voice so tender,
 “Come to Me.

Lo! from the desert homes
Where he hath hid so long,
The new Elias comes,
In sternest wisdom strong;
The voice that cries
Of Christ on high,
And judgment nigh
From opening skies.

Lo, God is here! let us adore,
And own how dreadful is this place!
Let all within us feel His power,
And silent bow before His face.

Lo, God to Heav’n ascendeth! Throughout its regions vast
With shouts triumphant blendeth the trumpet’s thrilling blast:
Sing praise to Christ the Lord; sing praise with exultation,
King of each heathen nation, the God of hosts adored!

Lo! golden light rekindles day:
Let paling darkness steal away,
Which all too long o’erwhelmed our gaze
And led our steps by winding ways.

Lo! He comes with clouds descending,
Once for favored sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending,
Swell the triumph of His train:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
God appears on earth to reign.

Lo, how a Rose e’er blooming from tender stem hath sprung!
Of Jesse’s lineage coming, as men of old have sung.
It came, a floweret bright, amid the cold of winter,
When half spent was the night.

Lo! now is our accepted day,
The time for purging sins away,
The sins of thought, and deed, and word,
That we have done against the Lord.

Lo! now the time accepted peals
Its tidings of release;
A time that with salvation heals,
And to repentant tears reveals
The mercy seat of peace.

Lo! round the throne at God’s right hand
The saints in countless myriads stand,
Of every tongue redeemed to God,
Arrayed in garments washed in blood.

Lo! round the throne, a glorious band,
The saints in countless myriads stand;
Of every tongue redeemed to God,
Arrayed in garments washed in blood,
Arrayed in garments washed in blood.

Lo, the day, the day of life!
Day of unimagined light,
Day when death itself shall die,
And there shall be no more night!

Lo! the golden fields are smiling,
Wherefore idle shouldst thou be?
Great the harvest, few the workers,
And the Lord hath need of thee.
Go and work, the time is waning,
Let thy earnest heart reply
To the call so oft repeated,
 “Blessed Master, here am I."

Lo! the Lord, the mighty Savior,
Quits the grave, His throne to claim;
Object of His endless favor,
God o’er all exalts His Name;
Those who hate Him—
Clothed with everlasting shame.

Lo! what a glorious sight appears
To our believing eyes!
The earth and sea are passed away,
And the old rolling skies.

Night had fallen darkly
Over Judea’s hill;
Shepherds watched in silence,
All the flocks were still;
Light dispelled the darkness,
Light, then day more fair,
Lo! a mighty angel,
Stood in glory there.

Long ago a shining throng,
Thrilled the midnight air with song;
For the Savior promised long,
Lay in Bethl’em’s stall.
Over Judah’s silent plain,
Sweetly rang the joyous strain;
Of His birth, Who yet shall reign,
As King of all.

Long ago the lilies faded
Which to Jesus seemed so fair,
But the love that bade them blossom
Still is working everywhere.

Long ago, prophets knew
Christ would come, born a Jew,
come to make all things new;
bear his people's burden,
freely love and pardon.

Long did I toil and knew no earthly rest,
far did I rove and found no certain home;
at last I sought them in his sheltering breast,
who opens his arms and bids the weary come:
with him I found a home, a rest divine,
and I since them am his and he is mine.
The good I have is from his stores supplied,
the ill is only what he deems the best;
he for my Friend, I'm rich with nought beside,
and poor without him, though of all possessed:
changes may come, I take or I resign,
content, while I am his, while he is mine.
Whate'er may change, in him no change is seen,
a glorious Sun that wanes not nor declines,
above the clouds and storms he walks serene,
and on his people's inward darkness shines:
all may depart, I fret not nor repine,
while I my Savior's am, while he is mine.
While here, alas! I know but half his love,
but half discern him and but half adore;
but when I meet him in the realms above
I hope to love him better, praise him more,
and feel and tell, amid the choir divine,
how fully I am his and he is mine.

Long Ere The Sun Began His Days
Or moon shot forth her silver raysm
Salvations's scheme was fixed, 'twas done,
In cov'nant by the Three in One.
The Father spake, the Son replied;
The Spirit with them both complied;
Grace moved the cause for saving man,
And wisdom drew the noble plan.
The Father chose His only Son
To die for sins that man had done;
Emmanuel to the choice agreed,
And thus secured a num'rous seed.
He sends His Spirit from above,
To call the objects of His love;
Not one shall perish or be lost;
His blood has bought them dear they cost.
What high displays of sov'reign grace!
What love to save a ruined race!
My soul, adore His lovely name,
By whom thy free salvation came.

Long have I sat beneath the sound
Of Thy salvation, Lord;
But still how weak my faith is found,
And knowledge of Thy Word!

Long Have I Tried Terrestrial Joys
But here can find no rest 
Far from earth's vanity and noise 
 "To be with Christ is best."
'T is desert here, and thorns and foes
Do all the road infest;
The danger of the journey's short 
 "To be with Christ is best."
When earth can no delights afford,
He spreads a heav'nly feast;
Such dainties crown his royal board 
 "To be with Christ is best."
By this I fly the desert through
And feel my soul refreshed;
What can obstruct me when I know,
 "To be with Christ is best?"
There an eternity with thee,
I'll think myself well blest;
I see thee here; but O! To be,
 "To be with Christ is best!"

Long upon the mountains weary,
Have the scattered flock been torn;
Dark the desert paths, and dreary;
Grievous trials have they borne.
Now the gathering call is sounding,
Solemn in its warning voice;
Union, faith, and love, abounding,
Bid the little flock rejoice.

I'm seeing lots of people looking sure of themselves
Never seem to say much
Feeling mighty cozy with their righteousness
But their Bible's still gathering dust
They've got a long way to go, such a long way to go
They've got a long way to go, such a long way to go

Long years ago o’er Bethlehem’s hills
Was seen a wondrous thing;
As shepherds watched the sleeping flocks
They heard the angels sing.
The anthem rolled among the clouds
When earth was hushed and still;
Its notes proclaimed sweet peace on earth,
To all mankind good will.

Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows

When you get to Heaven, as you surely will,
If the Savior’s Name you own,
After you have greeted those you love the best,
Who are standing round the throne—

Look from Thy sphere of endless day,
O God of mercy and of might,
In pity look on those who stray,
Benighted in this land of light.

If you from sin
Are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God.
He to redeem you died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Look, ye saints! the sight is glorious:
See the Man of Sorrows now;
From the fight returned victorious,
Every knee to Him shall bow;
Crown Him, crown Him,
Crown Him, crown Him,
Crowns become the Victor’s brow,
Crowns become the Victor’s brow.

Look up! look up! ye weary ones,
Whose skies are veiled in night;
For He Who knows the path you tread
Will yet restore the light;
Look up! and hail the dawning
Of hope’s triumphant morning.

Look upon us, blessed Lord,
Take our wandering thoughts and guide us;
We have come to hear Thy Word,
With Thy teaching now provide us,
That, from earth’s distractions turning,
We Thy message may be learning.

Hallelujah, hallelujah 

Look what the Lord has done, look what 
the Lord has done.
He healed my body, He touched my mind,
He saved me just in time.
O, I'm gonna praise His name, each day He's just the same.
Come on and praise Him, look what the Lord has done.
Come on and praise Him, look what the Lord has done.

Here among the shadows
 (Living) in a lonely land (with strangers)
We're a band of pilgrims on the move
 (Through dangers) burdened down with sorrows
 (And we are) Shunned on every hand
 (But we are) looking for a city built above

O shout aloud the tidings,
Let all the waiting nations
This message hear again;
The spotless Lamb of glory,
Who once for man was slain,
Soon o’er all the earth shall reign.

When you kneel by the bed of a loved one to pray
And the storm clouds are gathered 'round (gathered 'round)
And there's no place to turn but to the Lord above
By faith you have to look beyond the clouds

They advertise it on the television

Over the river, faces I see,
Fair as the morning, looking for me;
Free from their sorrow, grief and despair,
Waiting and watching patiently there.

Looking upward every day,
Sunshine on our faces;
Pressing onward every day
Toward the heavenly places;

Lord of the day
Lord of the light
Lord of the stars
And sun so bright
Lord of the land
Lord of the sea
Jesus is Lord Of you and me

Lord, accept the alms we offer,
Tokens of our love to thee;
Out of grateful hearts we render
This our act of charity;
Even though full well we know
All we have to thee we owe.
Use them, Father, to thy glory,
Teach us fully how to give,
For his sake who leaving heaven
Gave us all that we might live:
All we have could not suffice
To repay his Sacrifice.
Now the priest upon the altar
Doth present the bread and wine,
To become, in wondrous manner,
For our souls the food divine:
Soul and body by thee fed,
Praise we give for daily bread.
With our alms and our oblations
Take, O Lord, our prayers of love;
Make thy Church in fullest concord
Serve as one, below, above;
And in fellowship complete
Reach at last thy mercy-seat.

The Lord and King of all things
But yesterday was born;
And Stephen’s glorious offering
His birth-tide shall adorn:
No pearls of orient splendor,
No jewels can he show;
But with his own true heart’s blood
His shining vestments glow.

Lord and Master, who hast called us
All our days to follow thee,
We have heard thy clear commandment,
'Bring the children unto me.'
So we come to thee, the Teacher,
At thy feet we kneel to pray:
We can only lead the children
When thyself shalt show the way.
Teach us thy most wondrous method,
As of old in Galilee
Thou didst show thy chosen servants
How to bring men unto thee.
Give us store of wit and wisdom,
Give us love which never tires.
Give us thine abiding patience,
Give us hope which ay inspires.
Mighty Wisdom of the Godhead,
Thou the one eternal Word,
Thou the Counsellor, the Teacher,
Fill us with the fullness, Lord.

Lord and Savior, true and kind,
Be the Master of my mind;
Bless, and guide, and strengthen still
All my powers of thought and will.

Lord, as the day begins
lift up our hearts in praise;
take from us all our sins,
guard us in all our ways:
Our every step direct and guide
that Christ in all be glorified!
Christ be in work and skill,
serving each other's need;
Christ be in thought and will,
Christ be in word and deed:
Our minds be set on things above
in joy and peace, in faith and love.
Grant us the Spirit's strength,
teach us to walk his way;
so bring us all at length
safe to the close of day:
From hour to hour sustain and bless,
and let our song be thankfulness.
Now as the day begins
make it the best of days;
take from us all our sins,
guard us in all our ways:
Our every step direct and guide
that Christ in all be glorified!

Lord, as Thou wilt, deal Thou with me;
No other wish I cherish.
In life and death I cling to Thee;
Oh, do not let me perish!
Let not Thy grace from me depart
And grant an ever patient heart
To bear what Thou dost send me.

Lord, as to Thy dear cross we flee,
And plead to be forgiven,
So let Thy life our pattern be,
And form our souls for heaven.

Lord, as we Thy Name profess,
May our hearts Thy love confess;
And in all our praise of Thee
May our lips and lives agree.

The Lord ascendeth up on high,
The Lord hath triumphed gloriously,
In power and might excelling;
The grave and hell are captive led,
Lo! He returns, our glorious Head,
To His eternal dwelling.

The Lord at first had Adam made
Out of the dust and clay,
And in his nostrils breathed life,
E’en as the Scriptures say.
And then in Eden’s paradise
He placed him to dwell,
That he within it should remain,
To dress and keep it well.

Lord, at Thy Table I Behold
The wonders of thy grace;
But most of all admire that I
Should find a welcome place;
I that was all defiled in sin,
A rebel to my God;
I that have crucified His Son
And trampled on His blood.
What strange, surprising grace is this,
That such a soul has room!
My Savior takes me by the hand,
My Jesus bids me come.
"Eat, O my friends!" the Savior cries,
 "The feast was made for you;
For you I groaned, and bled and died,
And rose, and triumphed too."
With trembling faith and bleeding hearts,
Lord, we accept thy love;
 'Tis a rich banquet we have had,
What will it be above?
Ye saints below, and hosts of heav'n,
Join all your praising pow'rs;
No theme is like redeeming love,
No Savior is like ours.
Had I ten thousand hearts, dear Lord,
I'd give them all to thee;
Had I ten thousand tongues, they all
Should join the harmony.

The Lord be with us as we bend
His blessing to receive;
His gift of peace upon us send,
Before His courts we leave.

Lord, behold us with Thy 
blessing
Once again assembled here;
Onward be our footsteps 
pressing
In Thy love, and faith, and 
fear;
Still protect us
By Thy presence ever near.

Lord, behold us with thy favor
as we bless thy holy Name
for thy grace and love and mercy,
still from age to age the same.
We are sinful, thou art holy,
thou in heaven, on earth are we;
yet we dare to come before thee,
dare to lift our hearts to thee.
Praise we render for the blessings,
all unnumbered as the sand,
from thy treasury exhaustless
showered by thy gracious hand;
for the Father's love creating,
for the Savior's cleansing tide,
for the Spirit's grace we praise thee,
made, redeemed and sanctified.
For the font's renewing waters,
for the altar's feast divine,
ministered in changeless order
by the sacred threefold line;
for thy Spirit's holy unction,
for the Word's prophetic page,
for thy Church's creeds undying,
her enduring heritage.
For the memories we treasure,
that to this our home belong,
hours of sweet and high communion,
Matin prayer and Evensong;
for the lessons thou has taught us,
taught by joy and taught by pain,
Lord, for all thy countless blessings,
we uplift our festal strain.
Thankfully, our hearts remember
whom our eyes no longer see,
knowing, though the veil conceals them,
they with us are one in thee;
ever one, for one our Father,
one our Church, one our Creed,
they who worshiped here before us,
one with us their latest seed.
Grant us thine own royal priesthood,
Lord, like them to work, to pray,
in thy world and in thy temple
sacrificing day by day;
then--our earthly worship ended,
and our earthly labor done,--
bid us worship, bid us labor
there, where work and prayer are one.

Lord, bless and pity us,
Shine on us with Thy face,
That all the earth Thy way 
may know
And men may see Thy grace.

Like a fairy tale from a story book
A boy meets girl and love's first look
They will pledge their love
They will give their lives
Forever and ever no compromise
But the struggles and worries come sneakin' around
Nearly breakin' their hearts never makin' a sound
Lovin' each other's where strength is found
Lifting our voices and praying out loud (we pray out loud)

Lord, bring the day to pass
when forest, rock and hill,
the beasts, the birds, the grass,
will know your finished will:
when we attain our destiny
and nature lives in harmony.
Forgive our careless use
of water, ore and soil--
the plenty we abuse
supplied by others' toil:
save us from making self our creed,
turn us towards each other's need.
Give us, when we release
creation's secret powers,
to harness them for peace--
our children's peace and ours:
teach us the art of mastering
in servant form, which draws death's sting.
Creation groans, travails,
futile its present plight,
bound till the hour it hails
God's children born of light,
who enter on their true estate.
Come, Lord: new heavens and earth create.

Lord Christ, we praise your sacrifice,
your life in love so freely given.
For those who took your life away
you prayed, that they might be forgiven;
and there, in helplessness arrayed,
God's power was perfectly displayed.
Once helpless in your mother's arms,
dependent on her mercy then,
at last, by choice, in other hands,
you were as helpless once again;
and, at their mercy, crucified,
you claimed your victory and died.
Though helpless and rejected then,
you're now as risen Lord acclaimed;
forever by your sacrifice
is God's eternal love proclaimed:
the love, which, dying, brings to birth
new life and hope for all on earth.
So, living Lord, prepare us now
your willing helplessness to share,
to give ourselves in sacrifice,
to overcome the world's despair;
in love to give our lives away
and claim your victory today.

The Lord descended from 
above,
And bowed the heavens 
high;
And underneath His feet 
He cast
The darkness of the sky.
 (On cherubs and on 
cherubims)
Full royally He rode;
And on the wings of all 
the winds
Came flying all abroad;
And on the wings of all 
the winds
Came flying all abroad.

Lord, dismiss us with 
Thy blessing;
Fill our hearts with 
joy and peace;
Let us each Thy love 
possessing,
Triumph in redeeming 
grace.
O refresh us, O refresh 
us,
Traveling through this 
wilderness.

Lord, dismiss us with Thy 
blessing,
Thanks for mercies past 
receive;
Pardon all, their faults 
confessing;
Time that’s lost may all 
retrieve;
May Thy children
Ne’er again Thy Spirit 
grieve.

Lord, enthroned in 
heavenly splendor,
First begotten from 
the dead,
You alone, our strong 
Defender,
Now lift up Your 
people’s head.

Lord, for ever at thy side
let my place and portion be,
strip me of the robe of pride,
clothe me with humility.
Meekly may my soul receive
all thy Spirit hath revealed;
thou hast spoken; I believe,
though the oracle be sealed.
Humble as a little child,
weaneed from the mother's breast,
by no subtleties beguiled,
on thy faithful word I rest.
Israel, now and evermore
in the Lord Jehovah trust;
him, in all his ways, adore,
wise and wonderful and just.

Lord, for the years your love has kept and guided,
urged and inspired us, cheered us on our way,
sought us and saved us, pardoned and provided:
Lord for the years, we bring our thanks today.
Lord, for that word, the word of life which fires us,
speaks to our hearts and sets our souls ablaze,
teaches and trains, rebukes us and inspires us:
Lord of the word, receive your people's praise.
Lord, for our land in this our generation,
spirits oppressed by pleasure, wealth and care:
for young and old, for commonwealth and nation,
Lord of our land, be pleased to hear our prayer.
Lord, for our world where men disown and doubt you,
loveless in strength, and comfortless in pain,
hungry and helpless, lost indeed without you:
Lord of the world, we pray that Christ may reign.
Lord for ourselves; in living power remake us-
self on the cross, and Christ upon the throne,
past put behind us, for the future take us:
Lord of our lives, to live for Christ alone.

Lord, for tomorrow and its needs 
I do not pray;
keep me, my God, from stain of sin 
just for today.
Let me both diligently work
and duly pray;
Let me be kind in word and deed, 
just for today.
Let me be slow to do my will,
prompt to obey;
help me to sacrifice myself,
just for today.
Let me no wrong or idle word 
unthinking say;
set thou a seal upon my lips 
just for today.
Let me in season, Lord, be grave, 
in season gay;
let me be faithful to Thy grace, 
just for today.
Lord, for tomorrow and its needs 
I do not pray;
but keep me, guide me, love me, Lord,
just for today.

Lord, forever at Thy side
Let my place and portion be;
Strip me of the robe of pride,
Clothe me with humility.

Lord, from the depths to Thee I cried:
My voice, Lord, do Thou hear;
Unto my supplication’s voice
Give an attentive ear.

Lord, from the ill and froward man
Give me deliverance,
And do Thou safe preserve me from
The man of violence:

Gathered are we in the name of our God,
Lord, give us souls, Lord, give us souls;
Trusting His grace and His wonderful Word,
Lord, give us souls, we pray.

Lord God, by whom all change is wrought,
By whom new things to birth are brought,
In whom no change is known;
Whate'er thou dost, whate'er thou art,
Thy people still in thee have part;
Still, still thou art our own.
Ancient of Days, we dwell in thee;
Out of thine own eternity
Our peace and joy are wrought;
We rest in our eternal God,
And make secure and sweet abode
With thee, who changest not.
Spirit, who makest all things new,
Thou leadest onward; we pursue
The heavenly march sublime.
'Neath thy renewing fire we glow,
And still from strength to strength we go,
From height to height we climb.
Darkness and dread we leave behind;
New light, new glory still we find,
New realms divine possess;
New births of grace new raptures bring;
Triumphant, the new song we sing,
The great Renewer bless.
To thee we rise, in thee we rest;
We stay at home, we go in quest,
Still thou art our abode.
The rapture swells, the wonder grows,
As full on us new life still flows
From our unchanging God.

Lord God of hosts, in mercy
My supplication hear;
Almighty and all faithful,
Our fathers’ God, give ear.
Our Shield and great Defender,
No longer hide Thy face,
But look upon Thy servant,
Anointed by Thy grace.

Lord God of hosts, Whose mighty hand
Dominion holds on sea and land,
In peace and war Your will we see
Shaping the larger liberty;
Nations may rise and nations fall,
Your changeless purpose rules them all.

Lord God of Hosts, Whose purpose, never swerving,
Leads toward the day of Jesus Christ Thy Son,
Grant us to march among Thy faithful legions,
Armed with Thy courage, till the world is won.

Lord God of Hosts, within Whose hand
Dominion rests on sea and land,
Before Whose word of life or death
The strength of nations is but breath:
O King, enthroned all thrones above,
Give strength unto the land we love.

Lord God, the Holy Ghost,
In this accepted hour,
As on the day of Pentecost,
Descend in all Thy power.

Lord God, we all to Thee give praise,
Thanksgivings meet to Thee we raise,
That angel hosts Thou didst create
Around Thy glorious throne to wait.

Lord God, we worship Thee!
In loud and happy chorus
We praise Thy love and power,
Whose goodness reigneth o’er us.
To Heav’n our song shall soar,
Forever shall it be
Resounding o’er and o’er:
Lord God, we worship Thee!

Lord, grant your peace upon all here today.
Grant us your love and your truth to light our way.
Lord, grant your peace upon ev’ry living soul.
Grant us your love and your truth that we might know

Lord, guide and guide the men who fly
Through the great spaces of the sky;
Be with them traversing the air
In darkening storms or sunshine fair.

The Lord has heard and answered prayer
And saved His people in distress;
This to the coming age declare,
That they His holy Name may bless.

The Lord hath helped me hitherto
By His surpassing favor;
His mercies every morn were new,
His kindness did not waver.
God hitherto hath been my Guide,
Hath pleasures hitherto supplied,
And hitherto hath helped me.

Lord, hear me in distress, regard my suppliant cry,
And in Thy faithfulness and righteousness reply.
In judgment do not cause Thy servant to be tried;
Before Thy holy laws no man is justified.

Lord, hear my prayer, and let my cry
Have ready access unto Thee;
When in distress to Thee I fly,
O hide not Thou Thy face from me.
Attend, O Lord, to my desire,
O haste to answer when I pray;
For grief consumes my strength like fire,
My days as smoke pass swift away.

Lord, hear the right, regard my cry,
My prayer from lips sincere,
Send Thine approval from on high,
My righteousness make clear.
Thou in the night my heart hast tried,
Nor found it turned from Thee aside.

Lord, help us ever to retain
The catechism’s doctrine plain
As Luther taught the word of truth
In simple style to tender youth.

Lord, her watch Thy Church is keeping:
When shall earth Thy rule obey?
When shall end the night of weeping?
When shall break the promised day?
See the whitening harvest languish,
Waiting still the laborers’ toil;
Was it vain, Thy Son’s deep anguish?
Shall the strong retain the spoil?


The Lord, how wondrous are His ways!
How firm His truth! how large His grace!
He takes His mercy for His throne,
And thence He makes His glories known.

I wandered far away from home
Now I am coming home
The Paths of sin too long I've trod
Lord I 'm coming home.
Coming home Never more to roam
Open are thine arms of love
Lord I 'm coming home
I 've wasted many precious years
Now I 'm coming home
I now repent with bitter tears
Lord I'm coming home.
I 've sinned against my brother too
Now I'm coming home
By hurting him, I've tortured you
Lord I'm coming home.

Lord, I am fondly, earnestly longing
Into Thy holy likeness to grow;
Thirsting for more and deeper communion,
Yearning Thy love more fully to know.

Lord, I am Thine; but Thou wilt prove
My faith, my patience, and my love:
When men of spite against me join,
They are the sword, the hand is Thine.

Lord, I am Thine, entirely Thine,
Purchased and saved by blood divine;
With full consent Thine I would be,
And own Thy sovereign right in me.

Lord, I approach, Thy mercy seat,
Where Thou dost answer prayer;
There humbly fall before Thy feet,
For none can perish there.

"Lord, I believe: help Thou mine unbelief";
Let me no other master know but Thee.
Thou art the Christian’s God, the only King and Chief
Of all who soldiers of the cross would be.

Lord, I believe a rest remains
To all Thy people known,
A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
And Thou art loved alone.

Lord, I believe; Thy power I own,
Thy Word I would obey;
I wander comfortless and lone
When from Thy truth I stray.

Lord, I can suffer Thy rebukes,
When Thou with kindness dost chastise;
But Thy fierce wrath I cannot bear:
O let it not against me rise.

Lord, I cannot let Thee go,
[

Lord, I deserve thy deepest wrath,
Ungrateful, faithless I have been;
No terrors have my soul deterred,
Nor goodness wooed me from my sin.
No terrors have my soul deterred,
Nor goodness wooed me from my sin.

Lord I give You my heart
I give You my soul
I live for You alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I’m awake
Lord have Your way in me

Lord, I have made Thy Word my choice,
My lasting heritage;
There shall my noblest powers rejoice,
My warmest thoughts engage.

Lord, I hear of showers of blessing,
thou art scattering full and free;
showers the thirsty land refreshing;
let some drops now fall on me;
even me, even me,
let some drops now fall on me.
Pass me not, O God, my Father,
sinful though my heart may be;
thou mightst leave me, but the rather;
let thy mercy light on me;
even me, even me,
let thy mercy light on me.
Pass me not, O gracious Savior,
let me live and cling to thee;
I am longing for thy favor;
whilst thou'rt calling, O call me;
even me, even me,
whilst thou'rt calling, O call me.
Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
thou canst make the blind to see;
Witnesser of Jesus' merit,
speak the word of power to me;
even me, even me,
speak the word of power to me.
Have I been in sin long sleeping,
long been slighting, grieving thee?
Has the world my heart been keeping?
O forgive and rescue me;
Even me, even me,
O forgive and rescue me.
Love of God, so pure and changeless,
blood of Christ, so rich and free;
grace of God, so strong and boundless
magnify them all in me;
even me, even me,
magnify them all in me.
Pass me not; but pardon bringing,
bind my heart, O Lord, to thee;
whilst the streams of life are springing,
blessing others, O bless me;
even me, even me,
blessing others, O bless me.

Lord, I lift my soul to Thee,
O my God, I trust Thy might;
Let not foes exult o’er me,
Shame me not before their sight.
Yea, may none be put to shame,
None who wait for Thee to bless,
But dishonored be their name
Who without a cause transgress.

Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart, in my heart,
Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart, in my heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart, in my heart.

Lord I want to be a servant
Giving all my praise to you
Giving all I have to please you Lord
My heart makes pure and true

Lord, I was blind: I could not see
In Thy marred visage any grace;
But now the beauty of Thy face
In radiant vision dawns on me.

The Lord I will at all times bless,
My mouth His praises shall express;
In Him shall all my boasting be,
While all the meek rejoice with me.

Lord, if Thou dost not soon appear,
Virtue and truth will fly away;
A faithful man amongst us here
Will scarce be found, if Thou delay.

I've wandered far away from God,
Now I'm coming home;
The paths of sin too long I've trod,
Lord, I'm coming home.

Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
My voice ascending high;
To Thee will I direct my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye.

Lord, in the fullness of my might,
I would for Thee be strong:
While runneth o’er each dear delight,
To Thee should soar my song.

Lord, in the morning I will Send
My cries to reach thine ear;
Thou art my Father and my Friend,
My help forever near.
O lead me, keep me all this day
Near thee in perfect peace;
Help me to watch, to watch and pray,
To pray, and never cease.
I know my roving feet will err,
Unless thou be my guide;
Warn me of ev'ry foe and snare,
And keep me near thy side.
Then shall I pass all danger safe,
And tread the tempter down;
My trust, my hope, joy, and relief,
Shall be in thee alone.
Then let my moments sweetly run,
My hours thus passed away,
Till ev'ning shade and setting sun
Conclude in endless day.

Lord, in this Thy mercy’s day,
Ere for us it pass away,
On our knees we fall and pray.

Lord, in Thy Name Thy servants plead,
And Thou hast sworn to hear;
Thine is the harvest, Thine the seed,
The fresh and fading year.

Lord, in thy presence dread and sweet,
thine own dear Spirit we entreat
his sevenfold gifts to shed
on us, who fall before thee now,
bearing the cross upon our brow
on which our Master bled.
Spirit of Wisdom! turn our eyes
from earth and earthly vanities,
to heavenly truth and love.
Spirit of Understanding true!
Our souls with holy light endue
to seek the things above.
Spirit of Counsel! be our guide;
teach us by earthly struggles tried
our heavenly crown to win.
Spirit of Fortitude! thy power
be with us in temptation's hour,
to keep us pure from sin.
Spirit of Knowledge! lead our feet
in thine own paths secure and sweet,
by angel footsteps trod;
where thou our Guardian true shalt be,
Spirit of gentle Piety!
To keep us close to God.
But most of all, be ever near,
Spirit of God's most holy Fear,
in our heart's most inmost shrine;
our souls with loving reverence fill,
to worship his most holy Will
all-righteous and divine.
So, dearest Lord, through peace or strife,
lead us to everlasting life,
where only rest may be.
What matter where our lot is cast,
if only it may end at last
in paradise with thee!

The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,
And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice;
The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,
To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.

The Lord is come! On Syrian soil,
The child of poverty and toil;
The Man of Sorrows, born to know
Each varying shade of human woe:
His joy, His glory, to fulfill,
In earth and Heav’n, His Father’s will;
On lonely mount, by festive board,
On bitter cross, despised, adored.

The Lord is coming, let this be
The herald note of jubilee;
And when we meet and when we part
The salutation from the heart.

The Lord is coming by and by,
Be ready when He comes;
He comes from His fair home on high,
Be ready when He comes;
He is the Lord our Righteousness,
And comes His chosen ones to bless,
And at His Father’s throne confess;
Be ready when He comes.

The Lord is great; with worthy praise
Proclaim His power, His Name confess,
Within the city of our God,
Upon His mount of holiness.

The Lord is King! I own His pow’r,
His right to rule each day and hour;
I own His claim on heart and will,
And His demands I would fulfill.

Hear the everlasting song,
Breaking thro’ the sky:
“Glory, glory be to God,
To God on high!"
Thro’ the blessed courts of light
Saints and angels, joyful singing,
Strike their harps and shout aloud,
“The Lord is King!"

The Lord is King! lift up thy voice,
O earth; and all ye heav’ns, rejoice!
From world to world the joy shall ring,
 “The Lord omnipotent is King."

The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know;
I feed in green pastures, safe folded I rest;
He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
Restores me when wand’ring, redeems when oppressed.

The Lord is rich and merciful,
The Lord is very kind;
O come to Him, come now to Him,
With a believing mind!
His comforts, they shall strengthen thee,
Like flowing waters cool;
And He shall for thy spirit be
A fountain ever full.

The Lord is risen indeed!
And are the tidings true?
Yes, we beheld the Savior bleed,
And saw Him living, too.

The Lord is ris’n indeed,
Loud let His praises ring!
From death’s dominion freed,
Ascends the conqu’ring King,
At God’s right hand to take His place
And reign supreme through everlasting days.

Lord, it belongs not to my care
Whether I die or live;
To love and serve Thee is my share,
And this Thy grace must give.

Lord Jehovah, in Thy temple,
Happy children we appear,
Bringing incense of thanksgiving,
For the love that led us here.
Hallelujah! praise Jehovah,
For the love that led us here,
Hallelujah! praise Jehovah,
For the love that led us here.

The Lord Jehovah reigns; His throne is built on high.
The garments He assumes are light and majesty.
His glories shine
With beams so bright no mortal eye
Can bear the sight.

Lord Jesu, when we stand afar
And gaze upon Thy holy cross,
In love of Thee, and scorn of self,
O may we count the world as loss!

Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord most dear,
as thou wast once an infant here,
so give this child of thine, we pray,
thy grace and blessing day by day.

Lord Jesus Christ, my Life, my Light,
My Strength by day, my Trust by night,
On earth I’m but a passing guest
And sorely with my sins oppressed.

Lord Jesus Christ, my Savior blest,
My Hope and my Salvation!
I trust in Thee; deliver me from misery;
Thy Word’s my consolation.

Lord Jesus Christ, Thou hast prepared
A feast for our salvation,
It is Thy body and Thy blood;
And at Thy invitation
As weary souls, with sin oppressed,
We come to Thee for needed rest,
For comfort, and for pardon.

Lord Jesus Christ, Thou living Bread,
May I for mine possess Thee.
I would with heav’nly food be fed;
Descend, refresh, and bless me.
Now make me meet for Thee, O Lord;
Now, humbly by my heart implored,
Grant me Thy grace and mercy.

Lord Jesus Christ, we humbly pray
That we may feed on Thee today;
Beneath these forms of bread and wine
Enrich us with Thy grace divine.

Lord Jesus Christ, with us abide,
For round us falls the eventide;
Nor let Thy Word, that heav’nly light,
For us be ever veiled in night.

Lord Jesus, Thou the Church's Head,
Thou art her one Foundation;
In Thee she trusts, before Thee bows,
And waits for Thy salvation.
Built on this Rock secure,
Thy Church shall endure
E'en though the world decay
And all things pass away.
Oh, hear, oh, hear us, Jesus!

Lord Jesus, when we stand afar
and gaze upon thy holy cross,
in love of thee and scorn of self,
O may we count the world as loss!
When we behold thy bleeding wounds,
and the rough way that thou hast trod,
make us to hate the load of sin
that lay so heavy on our God.
O holy Lord, uplifted high,
with outstretched arms in mortal woe,
embracing in thy wondrous love
the sinful world that lies below.
Give us an ever-living faith
to gaze beyond the things we see;
and in the mystery of thy death
draw us and all men unto thee.

Lord Jesus, who art come
A Teacher sent from heaven
And by both word and deed
God's truth to us hast given,
Thou wisely hast ordained
The holy ministry
That we, Thy flock, may know
The way to God through thee.

Lord Jesus, who at Lazarus' tomb
to weeping friends from death's dark womb
didst bring new joy to life,
grant to the friends who stand forlorn
a vision of that larger morn
where peace has conquered strife.
May we behold across the bar
the dear immortals as they are,
empowered in act and will,
with purer eyes to see their King,
with fuller hearts his praise to sing,
with strength to help us still.
Not fettered now by fleshly bond,
but tireless in the great beyond,
and growing day by day.
Can we not make their gladness ours,
and share their thoughts, their added powers,
and follow as we pray?
O Holy Ghost, the strength and guide
of those who to this earth have died,
but live more near to God,
give us thy grace to follow on,
till we with them the crown have won
who duty's paths have trod.

Lord Jesus, blessed Giver,
We give of Thine to Thee;
Thy gifts are like a river,
Full flowing, wide and free.
So let our love, outgoing
Among the songs of men,
Thy strength and joy bestowing,
Return Thy gifts again.

Lord Jesus, Christ, be present now,
Our hearts in true devotion bow,
Thy Spirit send with grace divine,
And let Thy truth within us shine.

Lord Jesus, come! Nor let us longer roam
Afar from Thee, and that bright place
Where we shall see Thee face to face.
Lord Jesus, come! Lord Jesus, come!

Lord Jesus, God and Man,
For love of man a Child,
The very God, yet born on earth
Of Mary undefiled.

Lord Jesus, let Thy watchful care
Thy faithful love, our brethren tend;
Their hearts sustain, their way prepare
And safely guide them to the end.

Lord Jesus, on the holy mount
We would abide with Thee,
Still drinking from the blessed fount
Of grace, so rich and free.

Lord Jesus, think on me
And purge away my sin;
From earthborn passions set me free
And make me pure within.

Lord Jesus, Thou dost keep Thy child
Through sunshine or through tempests wild;
Jesus, I trust in Thee:
Thine is such wondrous pow’r to save;
Thine is the mighty love that gave
Its all on Calvary.

Lord Jesus, we give thanks to Thee
That Thou hast died to set us free;
Made righteous through Thy precious blood,
We now are reconciled to God.

Lord, lead the way the Savior went,
By lane and cell obscure;
And let love’s treasures still be spent,
Like His, upon the poor.

Lord, let Thy Spirit, from earthly passion weaning,
Lead me along Thy will’s all-holy way,
To find by faith, on Jesus’ bosom leaning,
’Mid trial, doubt and need, in Him my stay.

Lord, like the publican I stand,
And lift my heart to Thee;
Thy pardoning grace, O God, command,
Be merciful to me.

From the ends of the earth  (From the ends of the earth)
From the depths of the sea  (From the depths of the sea)
From the heights of the heavens  (From the heights of the heavens)
Your name be praised
From the hearts of the weak  (From the hearts of the weak)
From the shouts of the strong  (From the shouts of the strong)
From the lips of all people  (From the lips of all people)
This song we raise, Lord
Throughout the endless ages
You will be crowned with praises,  Lord Most High
Exalted in every nation
Sovereign of all creation
Lord Most High, Be magnified

The Lord my pasture shall prepare
And feed me with a shepherd’s care;
His presence shall my wants supply
And guard me with a watchful eye;
My noonday walks He shall attend
And all my midnight hours defend.

Lord my petition heed,
Now help me in my need,
My Savior be.
I am Thy servant, Lord,
My trust is in Thy Word,
Mercy to me afford,
I cry to Thee.

The Lord my Shepherd holds me
Within His tender care,
And with His flock He folds me,
No want shall find me there.
In pastures green He feeds me,
With plenty I am blest;
By quiet streams He leads me,
And makes me safely rest.

The Lord's my Shephard, I'll not want
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green, He leadeth me
In pastures green, He leadeth me
The quiet waters by

Lord, my weak thought in vain would climb
To search the starry vault profound;
In vain would wing her flight sublime
To find creation’s utmost bound.

Lord, not despairingly
come I to thee;
Lord, not distrustingly
bend I the knee.
Sin hath gone over me,
yet is this still me plea,
yet is this still me plea,
Jesus hath died.
Lord, I confess to thee
sadly my sin;
all I am tell I thee,
all I have been.
Purge thou my sin away,
wash thou my soul this day,
wash thou my soul this day,
Lord, make me clean.
Faithful and just art thou,
forgiving all;
low at thy pierced feet,
Savior, I fall.
Lord, let the cleansing blood,
blood of the Lamb of God,
blood of the Lamb of God,
pass o'er my soul.
Then all is peace and light
this soul within:
thus shall I walk with thee
the Loved unseen.
Leaning on thee, my God,
guided along the road,
guided along the road,
nothing between.

Lord, not for light in darkness do we pray,
Not that the veil be lifted from our eyes,
Not that the slow ascension of our day
Be otherwise.

Lord of all being, throned afar,
Thy glory flames from sun and star;
Center and soul of every sphere,
Yet to each loving heart how near!

Lord of all creation,
now before thy throne,
we thy people bring thee
gifts that are thine own.
Thine is all the greatness,
power and glory thine,
high o'er all exalted,
Majesty Divine.

Lord of all power and might,
Father of love and light,
Speed on Thy Word!
O let the Gospel sound
All the wide world around,
Wherever man is found!
God speed His Word!

Lord of all worlds, let thanks and praise
To Thee forever fill my soul;
With blessings Thou hast crowned my days,
My heart, my head, my hand control.
O, let no vain presumptions rise,
No impious murmur in my heart,
To crave the boon Thy will denies,
Or shrink from ill Thy hands impart.

Lord of beauty, thine the splendor
shown in earth and sky and sea,
burning sun and moonlight tender,
hill and river, flower and tree:
lest we fail our praise to render
touch our eyes that they may see.
Lord of wisdom, whom obeying
mighty waters ebb and flow,
while unhasting, undelaying,
planets on their courses go:
in thy laws thyself displaying,
teach our minds thyself to know.
Lord of life, alone sustaining
all below and all above,
Lord of love, by whose ordaining
sun and stars sublimely move:
in our earthly spirits reigning,
lift our hearts that we may love.
Lord of beauty, bid us own thee,
Lord of truth, our footsteps guide,
till as Love our hearts enthrone thee,
and, with vision purified,
Lord of all, when all have known thee,
thou in all art glorified.

Lord of creation, bow Thine ear, O Christ, to hear
The intercession of Thy servant true and dear,
That we unworthy, who have trespassed in Thy sight,
May live before Thee where he dwells in glorious light.

Lord of earth, Thy forming hand,
Well this beauteous frame hath planned,
Woods that wave, and hills that tower,
Ocean rolling in his power;
Yet amidst this scene so fair,
Should I cease thy smile to share,
What were all its joys to me?
Whom have I on earth but Thee?

The Lord of glory is my light,
And my salvation too;
God is my strength, nor will I fear
What all my foes can do.

Lord of Glory, Who hast bought us with Thy lifeblood as the price,
Never grudging for the lost ones that tremendous sacrifice;
And with that hast freely given blessings countless as the sand,
To the unthankful and the evil with Thine own unsparing hand.

Lord of heaven and earth and ocean,
hear us from thy bright abode,
while our hearts, with deep devotion,
own their great and gracious God:
now with joy we come before thee,
seek thy face, thy mercies sing;
Lord of life and light and glory,
guard thy Church and guide our queen.

Lord of life, all praise excelling,
Thou, in glory unconfined,
Deignst to make Thy humble dwelling
With the poor of humble mind.

Lord of life and King of glory,
Who didst deign a child to be,
Cradled on a mother’s bosom,
Throned upon a mother’s knee:
For the children Thou hast given
We must answer unto Thee!

The Lord of life is risen;
Sing, Easter heralds, sing!
He bursts His rocky prison;
Wide let the triumph ring!
In death no longer lying,
He rose, the Prince, today;
Life of the dead and dying,
He triumphed o’er decay.

Lord of Life, prophetic Spirit,
In sweet measure evermore
To the holy children dealing
Each his gift from Thy rich store;
Bless Thy family, adoring
As in Israel’s schools of yore.

Lord of light, Whose Name outshineth
All the stars and suns of space,
Deign to make us Thy coworkers
In the kingdom of Thy grace;
Use us to fulfill Thy purpose
In the gift of Christ Thy Son.

There is one who has loved us more than any other
He left His home and father for His bride
Carefully He searched until He found her
And lovingly He offered her His life
Selflessly He showed His love with humility
He offered it all for her good
This mystery of grace that the Lord has shown
Is the kind of love I want for us to know (us to know)

Lord of mercy and of might,
Of mankind the Life and Light,
Maker, Teacher, Infinite;
Jesus, hear and save!

The Lord of might from Sinai’s brow
Gave forth His voice of thunder;
And Israel lay on earth below,
Outstretched in fear and wonder;
Beneath His feet was pitchy night,
And at His left hand, and His right,
The rocks were rent asunder.

Lord of our highest love!
Let now Thy peace be giv’n;
Fix all our thoughts on things above,
Our hearts on Thee in Heav’n.

Lord of our life, and God of our salvation,
Hear and receive Thy church’s supplication,
Lord God Almighty.

Lord of our life, God Whom we fear,
Unknown, yet known; unseen, yet near;
Breath of our breath, in Thee we live;
Life of our life, our praise receive.

God and Father of us all;
Lord of day, and Lord of night,
Listen to our solemn call:
Listen, whilst to Thee we raise
Songs of prayer, and songs of praise.

The Lord of Sabbath let us praise,
In concert with the blest,
Who, joyful in harmonious lays,
Employ an endless rest.

Lord of spirits, I surrender
For Thy use Thy gifts to me:
O but show Thy mercy tender
When my song no more shall be;
More and more my heart’s aflutter
With the thoughts I may not utter,
While life’s riddle great I ponder.

Lord of the Church, we humbly pray
For those who guide us in Thy way
And speak Thy holy Word.
With love divine their hearts inspire.
And touch their lips with hallowed fire
And needful strength afford.

The Lord of the harvest is coming,
We know not the day it will be
When He shall appear to His people,
The hour we His glory shall see.
Oh soul, are you ready to meet Him,
His own can you joyfully yield,
When Jesus shall come in His beauty
To earth, to His great harvest field?

Lord of the harvest! it is right and meet
That we should lay our first-fruits at Thy feet
With joyful Alleluia.

Lord of the harvest, hear
Thy needy servants’ cry;
Answer our faith’s effectual prayer,
And all our needs supply.

Lord of the harvest, once again,
We thank Thee for the ripened grain;
For crops safe carried, sent to cheer
Thy servants through another year;
For all sweet holy thoughts supplied
By seed time, and by harvest tide.

Lord of the hearts of men,
Thou hast vouchsafed to bless,
From age to age, Thy chosen saints
With fruits of holiness.

mountain heights

Lord of the living harvest
That whitens o’er the plain,
Where angels soon shall gather
Their sheaves of golden grain,
Accept these hands to labor,
These hearts to trust and love,
And deign with them to hasten
Thy kingdom from above.

Lord of the Sabbath and its light,
I hail Thy hallowed day of rest;
It is my weary soul’s delight,
The solace of my careworn breast,
The solace of my careworn breast.

Lord of the strong, when earth you trod,
you calmly faced the angry sea,
and fierce unmasked hypocrisy,
the traitor's kiss, the rabble's hiss,
the awful death upon the tree:
all glory be to thee, O God.
Lord of the weak, when earth you trod,
oppressors writhed beneath your scorn;
the weak, despised, depraved, forlorn,
you taught to hope and know the scope
of love divine for all who mourn:
all glory be to thee, O God.
Lord of the rich, when earth you trod,
to Mammon's power you never bowed,
but taught how men with wealth endowed
in meekness' school might learn to rule
the demon that enslaves the proud:
all glory be to thee, O God.
Lord of the poor, when earth you trod,
the lot you chose was hard and poor;
you taught us hardness to endure,
and so to gain through hurt and pain
the wealth that lasts for evermore:
all glory be to thee, O God.
Lord of us all, when earth you trod,
the life you led was perfect, free,
defiant of all tyranny.
Now give us grace that we may face
our foes with like temerity,
and glory give to thee, O God.

Lord of the worlds above, how pleasant and how fair
The dwellings of Thy love, Thine earthly temples are!
To Thine abode, my heart aspires with warm desires
To see my God.

Lord of the worlds, unseen or seen,
Whose eyes behold all things that are,
Who rulest earth and sea and air
And guid'st the course of every star,
Look pitying from thy throne, nor cease
To draw the nations to thy peace.
And if, at duty's trumpet call,
Our manhood now be summoned hence
To battle for the right, the just,
O shield them by thy providence.
How confident are those that stand
Beneath the shelter of thy hand!
To all who, spurning earthly joys,
Seek undismayed the trackless way
High in the wide expanse of heaven,
Be thou their help, by night and day;
Through fire, through cloud, o'er land, o'er wave,
Still by thy presence strong to save.
But should, O God, thy sovran will
Allow the final sacrifice,
To thee their lives are dedicate:
Not theirs to falter at the price.
O Lord of earth and sea and air,
For those in peril hear our prayer.
Not given in vain, these gallant lives!
The silent passing of the years
Shall touch them not, who fought - and fell:
They ask no tribute of our tears.
O loyal hearts, from death set free!
Not lost, but living unto thee.

The Lord our God alone is strong;
His hands build not for one brief day;
His wondrous works, through ages long,
His wisdom and His power display.

The Lord our God is clothed with might,
The winds obey His will;
He speaks, and in His heavenly height,
He speaks, and in His heavenly height,
The rolling sun stands still.

Lord, our Lord, Thy glorious Name
All Thy wondrous works proclaim;
In the heav’ns with radiant signs
Evermore Thy glory shines.
How great Thy Name!

The Lord our Savior is the Way
To purity and peace;
He gives His holy Word to guide
Our souls to Heavenly bliss.

Over all the earth, You reign on high
Every mountain stream, every sunset sky
But my one request, Lord my only aim
Is that You’d reign in me again

The wind was a howling and the waves were high
The Man was a walking on the water but something was
Holding me back, holding me back
Something was holding me back, holding me

Lord, that I may learn of thee,
Give me true simplicity;
Wean my soul, and keep it low,
Willing thee alone to know.
Let me cast myself aside,
All that feeds my knowing pride;
Not to man, but God submit,
Lay my reasonings at thy feet;
Of my boasted wisdom spoiled,
Docile, helpless, as a child,
Only seeing in thy light,
Only walking in thy might.
Then infuse the teaching grace,
Spir't of truth and righteousness;
Knowledge, love divine, impart,
Life eternal, to my heart.

Lord, the wind and sea obey thee,
moon and stars their homage pay thee
listen to us, as we pray thee,
who on thee for all depend.
Bless all travelers and strangers,
safely keep the ocean rangers,
guide them in the midst of dangers:
all to thee we now commend.
Bless the friends we've left behind us;
closer may our parting bind us:
may they dearer, better, find us,
when we reach our journey's end.
On our way, dear Lord, direct us;
where we err do thou correct us;
from the powers of ill protect us,
from all perils us defend.
May we know thy presence o'er us,
see thy guiding hand before us,
till thou safely dost restore us,
love to love and friend to friend.
Holy God, in mercy bending,
human souls with love befriending,
fit us all for joy unending
when this earthly course doth end.

Lord, Thou hast seen my soul sincere,
Hast made Thy truth and love appear;
Before mine eyes I set Thy laws,
And Thou hast owned my righteous cause.

Lord, Thy Church on Earth is Seeking Thy renewal from above;
Teach us all the art of speaking With the accent of Thy love.
We would heed Thy great commission; "Go ye into every place;
Preach, baptize, fulfill My mission, Serve with love and share My grace."
Freedom give to those in bondage, Lift the burdens caused by sin;
Give new hope, new strength and courage, Grant release from fears within.
Light for darkness, joy for sorrow; Love for hatred, peace for strife.
These and countless blessings follow As the Spirit gives new life.
In the streets of every city Where the bruised and lonely dwell,
We shall show the Savior's pity, We shall of His mercy tell.
In all lands and with all races We shall serve and seek to bring
All the world to render praises, Christ, to Thee, Redeemer, King.

Lord, 'tis not that I did choose Thee;
That, I know, could never be;
For this heart would still refuse Thee
Had Thy grace not chosen me.
Thou hast from the sin that stained me
Washed and cleansed and set me free
And unto this end ordained me,
That I ever live to Thee.

The Lord unto His Christ has said,
 “Sit Thou at My right hand,
Until I make Thine enemies
Submit to Thy command.
A scepter prospered by the Lord
Thy mighty hand shall wield;
From Zion Thou shalt rule the world,
And all Thy foes shall yield.

O Lord use me
O Lord use me
I want to be Your hands
I want to be Your mouth
O Lord, O Lord
Lord use me
To the ends of the earth I'll go
I'll serve You forever more
O Lord, my Lord use me

Lord, we believe to us and ours
The apostolic promise given;
We wait the pentecostal powers,
The Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.
To every one whom God shall call
The promise is securely made;
To you far off - he calls you all;
Believe the word which Christ hath said:
'The Holy Ghost, if I depart,
The Comforter, shall surely come,
Shall make the contrite sinner's heart
His loved, his everlasting home.'
Assembled here with one accord,
Calmly we wait the promised grace,
The purchase of our dying Lord:
Come, Holy Ghost, and fill the place.
If every one that asks may find,
If still thou dost on sinners fall,
Come as a mighty rushing wind;
Great grace be now upon us all.
Behold, to thee our souls aspire,
And languish thy descent to meet:
Kindle in each thy living fire,
And fix in every heart thy seat.

Lord, we come before thee now
At thy feet we humbly bow
Oh, do not our suit disdain
Shall we seek thee Lord in vain?
Shall we seek thee Lord in vain?
Lord, on thee our souls depend
In compassion, now descend
Fill our hearts with thy rich grace
Tune our lips to sing thy grace
And tune our lips to sing thy grace

Lord, we confess our numerous faults,
How great our guilt has been!
Foolish and vain were all our thoughts,
And all our lives were sin.

Lord, we confess our numerous faults,
How great our guilt has been!
Foolish and vain were all our thoughts,
And all our lives were sin.
you have spoken we rejoice:
words of love and life and freedom 
help us make their truth our choice!
Now in holy celebration
for your Word we worship you;
spoken, written, known in Jesus,
ours today to prove anew.
May we hear with understanding,
by your Spirit taught and led;
may the springs of all our being
by your living Word be fed;
may our hearts accept with meekness
all the grace your light makes known;
may obedience mark our footsteps
till we make each word our own!
You have spoken; yours the fullness,
ours the wealth of this your Word:
debtors, then as living letters,
we must make our gospel heard!
By your Spirit's power transform us;
shed your saving light abroad
till our lives by love in action
show our world the truth of God!

Lord we love you we
Bow before you we
All adore you and
Lift your lovely name
Lord we praise you we
Kneel before you we
All say "thank you" and
Magnify your name

Lord Christ, we praise your sacrifice,
your life in love so freely given.
For those who took your life away
you prayed, that they might be forgiven;
and there, in helplessness arrayed,
God's power was perfectly displayed.
Once helpless in your mother's arms,
dependent on her mercy then,
at last, by choice, in other hands,
you were as helpless once again;
and, at their mercy, crucified,
you claimed your victory and died.
Though helpless and rejected then,
you're now as risen Lord acclaimed;
forever by your sacrifice
is God's eternal love proclaimed:
the love, which, dying, brings to birth
new life and hope for all on earth.
So, living Lord, prepare us now
your willing helplessness to share,
to give ourselves in sacrifice,
to overcome the world's despair;
in love to give our lives away
and claim your victory today.

Lord, what was man, when made at first,
Adam the offspring of the dust,
That Thou shouldst set him and his race
But just below an angel’s place?

Lord, while for all mankind we pray
Of ev'ry clime and coast,
Oh, hear us for our native land,
The land we love the most!

Lord, who left the highest heaven
for a homeless human birth
and, a child within a stable,
came to share the life of earth--
with your grace and mercy bless
all who suffer homelessness.
Lord, who sought by cloak of darkness
refuge under foreign skies
from the swords of Herod's soldiers,
ravaged homes, and parents' cries--
may your grace and mercy rest
on the homeless and oppressed.
Lord, who lived secure and settled,
safe within the Father's plan,
and in wisdom, stature, favor
growing up from boy to man--
with your grace and mercy bless
all who strive for holiness.
Lord, who leaving home and kindred
followed still as duty led,
sky the roof and earth the pillow
for the Prince of glory's head--
with your grace and mercy bless
sacrifice for righteousness.
Lord, who in your cross and passion
hung beneath a darkened sky,
yet whose thoughts were for your mother,
and a thief condemned to die--
may your grace and mercy rest
on the helpless and distressed.
Lord, who rose to life triumphant
with our whole salvation won,
risen, glorified, ascended,
all the Father's purpose done--
may your grace, all conflict past,
bring your children home at last.

Lord, who shall sit beside thee,
Enthroned on either hand,
when clouds no longer hide thee,
 'mid all thy faithful band?
Who drinks the cup of sorrow
thy Father gave to thee
 'neath shows of the morrow
in dark Gethsemane;
Who on thy passion thinking
can find in loss a gain,
and dare to meet unshrinking
thy baptism of pain.
O Jesus, form within us
thy likeness clear and true;
by thine example win us
to suffer or to do.
This law itself fulfilleth,
Christlike to Christ is nigh,
and, where the Father willeth,
shall sit with Christ on high.

The Lord will come and not be slow;
His footsteps cannot err;
Before Him righteousness shall go,
His royal harbinger.

The Lord will come! the earth shall quake,
The hills their fixed seat forsake;
And, withering from the vault of night,
The stars withdraw their feeble light.

The Lord will happiness divine
On contrite hearts bestow;
Then tell me, gracious God, is mine
A contrite heart or no?

In some way or other the Lord will provide;
It may not be my way,
It may not be thy way;
And yet, in His own way,
 “The Lord will provide."

Lord, with glowing heart I’d praise Thee,
For the bliss Thy love bestows,
For the pardoning grace that saves me,
And the peace that from it flows:
Help, O God, my weak endeavor;
This dull soul to rapture raise:
Thou must light the flame, or never
Can my love be warmed to praise.

Lord, You give the great commission:
“Heal the sick and preach the Word."
Lest the Church neglect its mission,
and the Gospel go unheard,
Help us witness to Your purpose
with renewed integrity,
With the Spirit’s gifts empower us
for the work of ministry.

Lord, a Savior’s love displaying,
Show the heathen lands Thy way;
Thousands still like sheep are straying
In the dark and cloudy day.

Lord, all I am is known to Thee:
In vain my soul would try
To shun Thy presence, or to flee
The notice of Thine eye.

Lord, on Thy returning day,
From common labor freed,
We are come to sing and pray
With felt returning need:
Come to seek our former rest,
Come to urge our old request.

Lord, pour Thy Spirit from on high,
And Thine ordained servants bless;
Graces and gifts to each supply,
And clothe Thy priests with righteousness.

The Lord proclaims His grace abroad!
 “Behold, I change your hearts of stone;
Each shall renounce his idol god,
And serve, henceforth, the Lord alone.

Lord, rebuke me not in anger,
Nor in wrath still chasten me,
Pity now and show me mercy,
Help thou my infirmity.

Lord, remove the veil away,
Let us see Thyself today:
Thou Who camest from on high,
For our sins to bleed and die,
Help us now to cast aside
All that would our hearts divide;
With the Father and the Son,
Let Thy living Church be one.

Lord, speak to me that I may speak
In living echoes of Thy tone;
As Thou has sought, so let me seek
Thine erring children lost and lone.

Lord, teach us how to pray aright,
With reverence and with fear;
Though dust and ashes in Thy sight,
We may, we must draw near.

Lord, the God of my salvation, day and night I cry to Thee;
Let my prayer now find acceptance, in Thy mercy answer me.
Full of troubles and affliction, nigh to death my soul is brought,
Helpless, like one cast forever from Thy care and from Thy thought.

The Lord, the Sovereign, sends His summons forth,
Calls the south nations and awakes the north;
From east to west the sounding orders spread,
Through distant worlds and regions of the dead:
No more shall atheists mock His long delay;
His vengeance sleeps no more: behold the day!

Lord, Thee I love with all my heart;
I pray Thee, ne’er from me depart;
With tender mercy cheer me.
Earth has no pleasure I would share,
Yea, Heav’n itself were void and bare
If Thou, Lord, wert not near me.
And should my heart for sorrow break,
My trust in Thee can nothing shake.
Thou art the portion I have sought;
Thy precious blood my soul has bought.
Lord Jesus Christ,
My God and Lord, my God and Lord,
Forsake me not! I trust Thy Word.

Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place
In every generation;
Thy people still have known Thy grace,
And blessed Thy consolation;
Through every age Thou heard’st our cry;
Through every age we found Thee nigh,
Our Strength and our Salvation.

Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place
Through all the ages of our race;
Before the mountains had their birth,
Or Thou hadst formed the earth;
From everlasting Thou art God,
To everlasting our abode.

Lord, Thou hast greatly blessed our land,
Thou hast brought back our captive band,
Thy pardoning grace has made us free
And covered our iniquity.

Lord, Thou hast promised grace for grace
To all who daily seek Thy face;
To them who have, Thou givest more
Out of Thy vast, exhaustless store.

Lord, Thou hast searched and seen me through,
Thine eye commands with piercing view
My rising and my resting hours,
My heart and flesh with all their powers.

Lord, Thou hast searched me and dost know
Where’er I rest, where’er I go;
Thou knowest all that I have planned,
And all my ways are in Thy hand.

Lord, Thou lov’st the cheerful giver,
Who with open heart and hand
Blesses freely, as a river
That refreshes all the land.
Grant us then the grace of giving
With a spirit large and free,
That our life and all our living
We may consecrate to Thee.

Lord, Thou wilt hear me when I pray,
I am forever Thine;
I fear before Thee all the day,
Nor would I dare to sin.

Lord, through all the generations
Of the children of our race,
In our fears and tribulations,
Thou hast been our dwelling place.
Ere the vast and wide creation
By Thy word was caused to be,
Or the mountains held their station,
Thou art God eternally.

Lord, through this holy week of our salvation,
Which Thou hast won for us who went astray,
In all the conflict of Thy sore temptation,
We would continue with Thee day by day.

Lord, Thy children guide and keep,
As with feeble steps they press
On the pathway rough and steep
Through the weary wilderness.
Holy Jesus, day by day,
Lead us in the narrow way.

“Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;
Earth is with its fullness stored;
Unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!"
Heaven is still with glory ringing;
Earth takes up the angels’ cry,
“Holy, holy, holy" singing,
“Lord of Hosts, the Lord Most High."

Lord, Thy mercy now entreating,
Low before Thy throne we fall;
Our misdeeds to Thee confessing,
On Thy Name we humbly call.

Lord, Thy Word abideth,
And our footsteps guideth;
Who its truth believeth
Light and joy receiveth.

Lord, Thy Word to me remember,
Thou hast made me hope in Thee;
This my comfort in affliction,
That Thy Word has quickened me.

Lord, to me Thy ways make known,
Guide in truth and teach Thou me;
Thou my Savior art alone,
All the day I wait for Thee.

Lord, to our humble prayers attend,
Let Thou Thy peace from heaven descend,
And to our souls salvation send,
Have mercy, Lord upon us.

Lord, to Thee alone we turn,
To Thy cross for safety fly;
There, as penitents, to learn
How to live and how to die.
Sinful on our knees we fall;
Hear us, as for help we plead;
Hear us when on Thee we call;
Aid us in our time of need.

Lord, to Thee I make confession;
I have sinned and gone astray,
I have multiplied transgression,
Chosen for myself my way.
Led by Thee to see my errors,
Lord, I tremble at Thy terrors.

Lord, we are blind, we mortals blind,
We can’t behold Thy bright abode;
O ’tis beyond a creature mind
To glance a thought half way to God!

Lord, we come and offer praise—
Lord we give You thanks, and we praise Your Name.
God of Israel’s chosen race—
Lord we give You thanks, and we praise Your Name.
You’re the everlasting Lord—
Lord we give You thanks, and we praise Your Name.
Greatness and pow’r in You are stored—
Lord we give You thanks, and praise Your glorious 
Name.

Lord, we come before Thee now,
At Thy feet we humbly bow;
Oh, do not our suit disdain!
Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain?

Lord, we know that Thou art near us,
Though Thou seem’st to hide Thy face;
And are sure that Thou dost hear us,
Though no answer we embrace.

Lord, we thank Thee for the pleasure
That our happy lifetime gives,
For the boundless worth and treasure
Of a soul that ever lives;
Mind that looks before and after,
Lifting eyes to things above;
Human tears, and human laughter,
And the depths of human love.

Lord, when I all things would possess,
I crave but to be Thine;
O lowly is the loftiness
Of these desires divine.

“Lord, when Thy kingdom comes, remember me";
Thus spake the dying lips to dying ears;
O faith, which in that darkest hour could see
The promised glory of the far off years!

Lord, when we bend before Thy throne,
And our confessions pour,
Teach us to feel the sins we own,
And hate what we deplore.

Lord, when we have not any light,
And mothers are asleep;
Then through the stillness of the night,
Thy little children keep.

Lord, while afar our brothers fight,
Thy Church united lifts her prayer;
Be Thou their Shield by day and night;
Guide, guard, and help them everywhere:
O God of battles, hear our cry,
And in their danger be Thou nigh.

Lord, Who at Cana’s wedding feast
Didst as a Guest appear,
Thou dearer far than earthly guest,
Vouchsafe Thy presence here.
For holy Thou indeed dost prove
The marriage vow to be,
Proclaiming it a type of love
Between the Church and Thee.

The Lord Who has remembered us
His blessing will bestow;
All those who fear His holy Name,
His loving care shall know.

Lord, who shall come to Thee,
And stand before Thy face?
Who shall abide, a welcome guest,
Within Thy holy place?

Lord, Who the night You were betrayed did pray
That all Your Church might be forever one;
Help us at every Eucharist to say
With willing heart and soul, “Your will be done."
That we may all one bread, one body be
Through this, Your sacrament of unity.

Lord, Who throughout these forty days
For us didst fast and pray,
Teach us with Thee to mourn our sins
And close by Thee to stay.

Lord, Whom winds and waves obey,
Guide us through the watery way;
In the hollow of Thy hand
Hide, and bring us safe to land.

The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

Seated one day at the organ,
I was weary and ill at ease,
And my fingers wandered idly
Over the noisy keys;
I know not what I was playing,
Or what I was dreaming then,
But I struck one chord of music,
Like the sound of a great Amen,
Like the sound of a great Amen.

Lost In the Ruins of The Fall
I lay in awful night,
Till Great Jehovah changed my heart,
And gave me heav'nly light.
Born of the Lord, I rose from death,
Flew to the Prince of Peace;
He loved the rising of my soul,
And showed a smiling face.
Born of the Lord, I feel a pow'r
That draws to Jesus' blood,
Loosens my soul from chain of gauilt,
And leads it to my God.
Born of the Lord, I can't allow.
That sin should rule my heart;
But long that ev'ry evil Thought
Might evermore depart
Born of the Lord, my happy soul
In flames of love arise;
Love my dear Father and His flock,
And love His holy ways.
Born of the Lord, I soon shall fly,
Fly to His bright abode;
Rise to the honors of His throne,
And live and reign with God.

I see people makin' money of time
I ask myself, "Should life be a nickel and dime?"

I walked in her room and saw her there
She knelt so quietly I knew she was in prayer
There was a presence in the room I felt before
But I was frightened so I turned to close the door

Love divine, all loves excelling,
Joy of heaven to earth come down;
Fix in us thy humble dwelling;
All thy faithful mercies crown!
Jesus, Thou art all compassion,
Pure unbounded love Thou art;
Visit us with Thy salvation;
Enter every trembling heart.

Love when it's hard to be loving
The world is a lovelier place
Be a friend when it's hard to be friendly
The world wears a friendlier face

Wonderful love that rescued me, sunk deep in sin,
Guilty and vile as I could be—no hope within;
When every ray of light had fled, O glorious day!
Raising my soul from out the dead, love found a way.

I know this is an evil world
That we all live in
Full of pain, strife and struggles
And at times we hurt way, way down deep within
Jesus shed his blood for you and me
On this journey He's by my side
He has set a sinner like me free
Love is the power that makes everything all right

Love is the sweetest bud that blows,
Its beauty never dies;
On earth among the saints it grows,
And ripens in the skies.
Pure, glowing red, and spotless white.
Its perfect colors are;
In Jesus all its sweets unite
And look divinely fair.
The finest flower that ever blowed
Opened on Calv'ry's tree
When Jesus' blood in rivers flowed
For love of worthless me.
Its deepest hue, its richest smell,
No mortal sense can bear;
Nor can the tongue of angels tell
How bright the colors are.
Earth could not hold so rich a flower,
Nor half its beauties show;
Nor could the world and Satan's power
Confine its sweets below.
On heaven's bank supremely fair
This flower of wonder blooms--
Transplanted to its native air--
And all the shore perfumes.
But not to heaven's shore confined;
The seeds from which it grows,
Take root within the human mind,
And scent the church below.
And soon on yonder banks above
Shall every blossom here
Appear a full ripe flower of love.
Like him transplanted there.

Of the themes that men have known,
One supremely stands alone;
Through the ages it has shown,
’Tis His wonderful, wonderful love.

I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more,
But the Master of the sea, heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me, now safe am I.

The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell;
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

In holiness brilliant, in righteousness bright,
Yet sweet in compassion with touch soft and light,
My Father in ravishing love now draws nigh,
To cherish my soul as the gem of His eye.

I'm gonna love my Savior with all my heart
I'm gonna love my Savior with all my heart
I'm gonna love my Savior with all my heart
I'm gonna love my Savior with all my heart
Love the Lord Jesus
Love the Lord Jesus
Love the Lord Jesus
Love the Lord Jesus

Love thyself last.
Look near, behold thy duty
To those who walk beside thee down life’s road;
Make glad their days by little acts of beauty,
And help them bear the burden of earth’s load.

Love was when God became a Man,
Locked in time and space, without rank or place;
Love was God born of Jewish kin;
Just a carpenter with some fishermen.
Love was when Jesus walked in history,
Lovingly He brought a new life that's free,
Love was God nailed to bleed and die
To reach and love one such as I.
Love was when God became a Man,
Down where I could see Love that reached to me;
Love was God dying for my sin
And so trapped was I my whole world caved in.
Love was when Jesus met me, now it's real;
Lovingly He came, I can feel He's real!
Love was God, only He would try
To reach and love one such as I.

Birds are rejoicing,
O’er hill and dell;
Hushed is thy voicing,
Sweeter that fell.
Friend of our happy days,
Brother of prayer and praise,
Thine own sweet music says,
Loved one, farewell!

Loved with everlasting love,
Led by grace that love to know,
Spirit, breathing from above,
You have taught me it is so.
O this full and perfect peace!
O this presence so divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His, and He is mine.
Heaven above is softer blue,
Earth around is sweeter green;
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen:
Birds with gladder songs o'er-flow,
Flowers with deeper beauties shine,
Since I know, as now I know,
I am His, and He is mine.
His for ever, only His;
Who the Lord and me shall part?
Ah, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart!
Heaven and earth may fade and flee;
First-born light in gloom decline;
But while God and I shall be,
I am His, and He is mine.

You can see it clearly
In a baby's eyes
It's always unexpected
Such a sweet surprise

Lovers of pleasure more than God,
For you He suffered pain;
Swearers, for you He spilt his blood;
And shall He bleed in vain?

While still a young man I read the old, old story
Of how a Savior came for me
But my heart couldn't see, oh, how this could be
For who would do this for me?

Love's redeeming work is done,
fought the fight, the battle won.
Lo, our Sun's eclipse is o'er!
Lo, he sets in blood no more!
Vain the stone, the watch, the seal!
Christ has burst the gates of hell;
death in vain forbids him rise;
Christ has opened paradise.
Lives again our victorious King;
where, O death, is now thy sting?
Dying once, he all doth save;
where thy victory, O grave?
Soar we now where Christ has led,
following out exalted Head;
made like him, like him we rise,
ours the cross, the grave, the skies.
Hail the Lord of earth and heaven!
Praise to thee by both be given:
thee we greet triumphant now;
hail, the Resurrection thou!

Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,
In thy gracious hands I am;
Make me, Saviour, what thou art;
Live thyself within my heart.
Fain I would to thee be brought;
Gracious Lord, forbid it not;
In the kingdom of thy grace
Give a little child a place.
Fain I would be as thou art;
Give me thy obedient heart;
Thou art pitiful and kind;
Let me have thy loving mind.
Let me above all fulfill
God my heavenly Father's will;
Never his good Spirit grieve,
Only to his glory live.
I shall then show forth thy praise,
Serve thee all my happy days;
Then the world shall always see
Christ, the holy child, in me.

Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,
Keep Thy lamb, in safety keep;
Nothing can Thy power withstand,
None can pluck me from Thy hand.

Loving Spirit, loving Spirit,
you have chosen me to be--
you have drawn me to your wonder,
you have set your sign on me.
Like a mother, you enfold me,
hold my life within your own,
feed me with your very body,
form me of your flesh and bone.
Like a father, you protect me,
teach me the discerning eye,
hoist me up upon your shoulder,
let me see the world from high.
Friend and lover, in your closeness
I am known and held and blessed;
in your promised is my comfort,
in your presence I may rest.
Loving Spirit, loving Spirit,
you have chosen me to be--
you have drawn me to your wonder,
you have set your sign on me.

Lovingly the Shepherd,
Seeking the lost sheep,
Found it tired and hungry
On the mountain steep.

Low in Thine agony,
Bearing Thy cross for me,
Savior divine!
In the dark tempter’s hour,
Quailing beneath his power,
Sorrowing yet more and more,
Thou dost incline.

From over hill and plain there comes the signal strain,
’Tis loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to Christ;
Its music rolls along, the hills take up the song,
Of loyalty, loyalty, yes, loyalty to Christ.

“Loyalty unto Christ" the trumpet now is sounding,
And the echoes answer from the fields of sin;
Nations are awaking, idol thrones are shaking,
For the great millennium is coming in.
Like a mighty army,
The heralds of the cross are spreading over land and sea.
Bearing through the darkness,
The light that leadeth to salvation full and free.

Lully, lullay, thou little tiny child,
bye, bye, lully lullay.
O sisters too, how may we do,
for to preserve this day,
this poor youngling for whom we sing,
bye, bye lully lullay.
Herod the king in his raging,
charged he hath this day,
his men of night, in his own sight,
all young children to slay.
Then woe is me, poor child, for thee!
And every morn and day,
for thy parting not say nor sing
bye, bye, lully lullay.
Lully, lullay, thou little tiny child,
bye, bye, lully lullay.

The Lord is come! On Syrian soil,
The child of poverty and toil;
The Man of Sorrows, born to know
Each varying shade of human woe:
His joy, His glory, to fulfill,
In earth and Heav’n, His Father’s will;
On lonely mount, by festive board,
On bitter cross, despised, adored.

A man named Nicodemus to Jesus came one night.
He said, “We know you’ve come from God; your wonders show his might."
In answer, Jesus did declare, “Give heed, these words are true:
You cannot see God’s kingdom come unless you’re born anew."
Then Nicodemus questioned, “Reborn, how can this be?
For surely none can to the womb return and new life see."
Jesus replied, “Flesh brings forth flesh, but like the blowing wind,
The Spirit does give birth to spirit; thus man is born again."
As Moses in the desert did lift the snake up high,
The Son of Man must be raised up that men might live, not die.
For God so loved this world of men, he gave his Son for us,
That we might have eternal life, if we in him do trust.
God did not send his Son to condemn the world of sin.
Christ came instead to save all those who place their trust in him.
All who believe escape God’s wrath; they come into the light.
But all who practice evil deeds are guilty in God’s sight.
Without the Son, all perish; the verdict is decreed.
All those who fail to trust Christ’s name condemned will ever be.
Lord, give me boldness to proclaim your message to the lost,
That they might gain eternal life by looking to the cross.

Man of Sorrows! what a name
For the Son of God, Who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim.
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood.
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
Guilty, vile, and helpless we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
“Full atonement!" can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
Lifted up was He to die;
“It is finished!" was His cry;
Now in Heav’n exalted high.
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew His song we’ll sing:
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

A message sweet is borne to me
On wings of joy divine;
A wondrous message, glad and free,
That thrills this heart of mine;
I’m saved by grace, by grace alone,
Through Christ, Whose love I claim,
No other could for sin atone,
Hosanna to His Name!
O glorious song that all day long
With tuneful note is ringing,
I’m saved by grace, amazing grace,
And that is why I’m singing!
I hear the message that I love
When morning dawns anew;
I read it in the sun above
That shines across the blue;
I hear it in the twilight still,
And at the sunset hour—
I’m saved by grace! what words can thrill
With such a magic power?
Oh, wondrous grace for all mankind,
That spreads from sea to sea!
It heals the sick and leads the blind,
And sets the prisoner free;
The soul that seeks it cannot fail
To see the Savior’s face,
And Satan’s power cannot prevail
If we are saved by grace.

A meteor bright its wondrous light
O’er Bethlem’s city shed,
To lead the way where Jesus lay,
Upon His lonely bed.
No nobles wait, no pomp or state
Surrounds the Babe divine,
But o’er His head bright circles spread,
In golden glories shine.
The wise men came to bless His Name
And own the Savior King,
And shepherd swains from far off plains
Their hearts’ glad incense bring.
So lowly born, He was the scorn
Of nations, kings and priests;
No belfry chime that Christmastime
Rang at their lordly feasts.
But heavenly choirs attuned their lyres
To hail a Prince’s birth,
And rapturous song from angel throng
Greeted the ear of earth.
The star is gone—the song flows on
To herald brighter days;
And truth’s pure beams in glowing streams
Make clear life’s darkened ways.

A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;
Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great, and, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.
Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God’s own choosing:
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth, His Name, from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.
And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us:
The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.
That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth:
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill: God’s truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever.

A hundred thousand souls a day
Are passing one by one away
In Christless guilt and gloom;
Without one ray of hope or light,
With future dark as endless night,
They’re passing to their doom,
They’re passing to their doom.
They’re passing, passing fast away
In thousands day by day;
They’re passing to their doom,
They’re passing to their doom.
O Holy Ghost, Thy people move,
Baptize their hearts with faith and love
And consecrate their gold.
At Jesus’ feet their millions pour,
And all their ranks unite once more,
As in the days of old,
As in the days of old.
The Master’s coming draweth near;
The Son of Man will soon appear;
His kingdom is at hand.
But ere that glorious day can be,
This gospel of the kingdom we
Must preach in every land,
Must preach in every land.
Oh, let us then His coming haste,
Oh, let us end this awful waste
Of souls that never die.
A thousand millions still are lost;
A Savior’s blood has paid the cost,
Oh, hear their dying cry,
Oh, hear their dying cry.
They’re passing, passing, fast away,
A hundred thousand souls a day
In Christless guilt and gloom.
O Church of Christ, what wilt thou say
When, in the awful judgment day,
They charge thee with their doom,
They charge thee with their doom?

The vision of a dying world is vast before our eyes;
We feel the heartbeat of its need, we hear its feeble cries:
Lord Jesus Christ, revive Your Church in this, her crucial hour!
Lord Jesus Christ, awake Your Church with Spirit given power.
The savage hugs a god of stone and fears descent of night;
The city dweller cringes lone amid the garish light:
Lord Jesus Christ, arouse Your Church to see their mute distress!
Lord Jesus Christ, equip Your Church with love and tenderness.
Today, as understanding's bounds are stretched on every hand,
O clothe Your Word in bright new sounds, and speed it o'er the land;
Lord Jesus Christ, empower us to preach by every means!
Lord Jesus Christ, embolden us in near and distant scenes.
The warning bell of judgment tolls, above us looms the cross;
Around are ever-dying souls - how great, the loss!
O Lord, constrain and move Your Church the glad news to impart!
And Lord, as now You stir Your Church, begin within my heart.

We were made in His image
Being formed by a perfect hand
At the dawn of creation
In His likeness He made man
When I'm down and weary is the time that I forget
How He came to make me like the best
There are people around me (people around) who don't know who they are (who they are)
They were made in the image (made just like Him) of the highest power (highest power)
No one's told them good news that been made so clear (made so clear, that's been made so clear)
I must tell it now so every one can hear (you can hear)
There are brothers around me (brothers around) who don't show who they are (who they are)
They were made in the image (made just like Him) of Jehovah God (He's our God)
They don't stop and think of what that really means (what that means, what that really means)
Being fashioned after Jesus the King of Kings (King of Kings)
We were made in His image
Made in His image
Made in the image of the best
Made in His image (just like Him)
Made in His image
Made in the image (better than all the rest) of the best
Made in His image
Made in His image
Made in the image of the best
Made in His image (just like Him) (we were made in His image)
Made in His image (just like the best)
Made in the image (better than all the rest) of the best (well, I just know that.)
Made in His image (just like Him) (we were made in His image)
Made in His image (just like the best)
Made in the image (better than all the rest) of the best (well, I just know that.)
Made in His image (just like Him)
Made in His image (fade)

Magdalene, thy grief and gladness
Voice and heart in concert sing,
Telling how the risen Saviour
Called thee from thy sorrowing,
Tidings of his Resurrection
To his chosen flock to bring.
She beheld him, yet she knew not
In the gardener's seeming guise
Christ, who in her heart was sowing
Seed of heavenly mysteries,
Till his voice, her name pronouncing,
Bade her see and recognise.
Weep not, Mary, weep no longer!
Now thy seeking heart may rest;
Christ the heavenly gardener soweth
Light and joy within thy breast;
In the glowing cry 'Rabboni!'
Be thy gratitude confest.

I will bless the Lord at all times
His praise shall always be in my mouth
My soul shall make its boast in the Lord
The humble shall hear it and rejoice
O magnify the Lord with me
O magnify the Lord with me
And let us exalt His name together
Magnify the Lord with me
O fear the Lord you His saints
To those who fear Him there is no want
The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous
His ears are open to their cry ()
Ascribe to the Lord o mighty ones
Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name
Worship the Lord in holiness ()
O magnify the Lord with me
O magnify the Lord with me
And let us exalt His name together
Magnify the Lord, magnify the Lord
Magnify the Lord with me
Magnify the Lord, magnify the Lord
Magnify the Lord with me

Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
Upon the Savior’s brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o’erflow,
His lips with grace o’erflow.
To Christ, the Lord, let every tongue
Its noblest tribute bring
When He’s the subject of the song,
Who can refuse to sing?
Who can refuse to sing?
Survey the beauties of His face,
And on His glories dwell;
Think of the wonders of His grace,
And all His triumphs tell,
And all His triumphs tell.
No mortal can with Him compare
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
Who fill the heav’nly train,
Who fill the heav’nly train.
He saw me plunged in deep distress
And flew to my relief;
For me He bore the shameful cross
And carried all my grief,
And carried all my grief.
His hand a thousand blessings pours
Upon my guilty head:
His presence gilds my darkest hours,
And guards my sleeping bed,
And guards my sleeping bed.
To Him I owe my life and breath
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death
And saves me from the grave,
And saves me from the grave.
To Heav’n, the place of His abode,
He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joys complete,
And makes my joys complete.
Since from His bounty I receive
Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord, they should all be Thine,
Lord, they should all be Thine.

Hark to the call of the New Crusade,
Christ over all will King be made;
Out to the world let the challenge ring:
Make Christ King!
Hail to the King of kings! Triumphant Redeemer!
On march the soldiers of the New Crusade.
This is the battle cry: Christ made the King!
And to our Sov’reign we allegiance bring;
Prince, Guide and Counselor He shall be.
Carry the standard to victory!
Hail to the call of the New Crusade:
Make Christ King!
Strong is the foe of the New Crusade,
Sin in its armor is well arrayed;
Into the fight we our best must fling:
Make Christ King!
Come, in His Name join the pilgrim throng,
Stand for the right, and down the wrong;
Glory to god, let the sing,
Make Christ King!

O youth, with life before you, and with gladness all around,
While in your heart the songs of hope and courage ring,
“Remember thy Creator while the evil days come not,"
And choose the Christ of Calvary to be your King.
Choose today! acknowledge Him your Savior;
Choose today! your heart a tribute bring
Unto Him who suffered to redeem you,
Let Him rule and reign, your King!
Choose today, for love and valiant service
Unto Him belong,
Take the vow, and ever faithful be
Till you sing the victor’s song.
True wisdom you are seeking; no one ever sought in vain
Who asked of Him who lived and taught in Galilee;
A fullness and a brightness for your life in Him you’ll find,
And safety from the sins that lie in wait for thee.
Courageous be, and loyal, for on every hand are foes
That wait with subtle charms to lead your feet astray,
Yet Christ the world’s Redeemer every step before you knows,
And He will guide, and guard, and love you all the way.

A storm gathers dark o’er the foam crested deep,
And souls on the billows are tossed;
Then forth let us go, with a message of hope,
Speed on, lest their vessel be lost.
Make haste, make haste,
Make haste to the rescue, away!
Speed on, quickly on, with a message of hope—
No time for a moment’s delay.
No bright beaming star in the darkness they see,
No bells from the harbor they hear;
Their frail, shattered bark, still is drifting afar,
Speed on, with a message of cheer.
A light softly breaks, and their peril is o’er;
They hear, and they answer our call;
Our boat hurries on with the Pilot on board—
In Him is a refuge for all.

Make haste, O my God, to deliver, I pray,
O Lord, to my rescue make haste;
Let those who would harm me be filled with dismay,
And in their own folly disgraced.
Let them be turned back in confusion, O Lord,
Who in my destruction would joy;
Let shame and defeat be their only reward,
Who sneers and derision employ.
May all those who seek Thee, and make Thee their choice,
Great gladness and blessedness see;
May all those who love Thy salvation rejoice
And constantly magnify Thee.
I cry in deep need and Thy help I implore;
Make haste to the rescue, I pray;
My Savior Thou art, and my Strength evermore,
No longer Thy coming delay.

Make haste, O man, to live,
For thou so soon must die;
Time hurries past thee like the breeze;
How swift its moments fly!
To breathe, and wake, and sleep,
To smile, to sigh, to grieve;
To move in idleness through earth,
This, this is not to live!
Up, then, with speed, and work;
Fling ease and self away;
This is no time for thee to sleep,
Up, watch, and work, and pray!
The useful, not the great,
The thing that never dies,
The silent toil that is not lost—
Set these before thine eyes.
The seed, whose leaf and flower,
Though poor in human sight,
Bring forth at last th’eternal fruit,
Sow thou by day and night.
Make haste, O man, to live,
Thy time is almost o’er;
O sleep not, dream not, but arise,
The Judge is at the door!

Tell of Christ Who saves from sin;
Make Him known—make Him known!
He has called you souls to win,
Make Him known!
Make the blessed Savior known,
Till all hearts shall be His throne;
Till He rules the world alone,
Make Him known.
For the world God gave His Son,
Make Him known—make Him known!
With the message quickly run,
Make Him known!
All the lost ones Christ has sought,
Make Him known—make Him known!
Great salvation He hath wrought,
Make Him known!
Go ye forth to all the world,
Make Him known—make Him known!
Let His banner be unfurled—
Make Him known!
Souls are groping in the night,
Make Him known—make Him known!
Jesus is the world’s true Light,
Make Him known!

Maker, in whom we live, in whom we are and move,
the glory, power, and praise receive for thy creating love.
Let all the angel throng give thanks to God on high,
while earth repeats the joyful song and echoes to the sky.
Incarnate Deity, let all the ransomed race
render in thanks their lives to thee for thy redeeming grace.
The grace to sinners showed ye heavenly choirs proclaim,
and cry, "Salvation to our God, salvation to the Lamb!"
Spirit of Holiness, let all thy saints adore
thy sacred energy, and bless thine heart-renewing power.
No angel tongues can tell thy love's ecstatic height,
the glorious joy unspeakable, the beatific sight.
Eternal, Triune God, let all the hosts above,
let all on earth below record and dwell upon thy love.
When heaven and earth are fled before thy glorious face,
sing all the saints thy love hath made thine everlasting praise.

There is no reason for to be so uptight
With all the wrong there's still plenty of right
God is our Father and He knows what to do
One thing's for certain He cares about you
Cast your cares on Jesus (cast your cares on Jesus)
He'll lift your heart and open your eyes
He knows us, He loves us (He knows us and He loves us)
He's always there to make it right (always makes it right)
There is no reason to be bent out of shape
One day in heaven will be worth the wait
Play in the Sonshine and dance in the Reign
Whatever season His love is the same
(Jesus cares for you)
Jesus cares for you (Jesus cares, Jesus cares and you know)
And you know He's your friend (Jesus cares, Jesus cares for you)
Jesus cares for you (Jesus cares, Jesus cares) (His love has no end)
His love has no end (Jesus cares, Jesus cares)

Out in the highways and byways of life,
many are weary and sad;
are weary and sad
Carry the sunshine where darkness is rife
making the sorrowing glad.
Make me a blessing,
Make me a blessing,
Out of my life
out of my life
May Jesus shine;
Make me a blessing, O savior, I pray,
I pray Thee, my Savior,
Make me a blessing to someone today.
Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love;
Tell of His pow'r to forgive;
His pow'r to forgive.
Others will trust Him if only you prove
true ev'ry moment you live.
Give as 'twas given to you in your need;
Love as the Master loved you;
Be to the helpless a helper indeed;
Unto your mission be true.

Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free.
Force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.
I sink in life’s alarms when by myself I stand;
Imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.
My heart is weak and poor until it master find;
It has no spring of action sure, it varies with the wind.
It cannot freely move till Thou has wrought its chain;
Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.
My power is faint and low till I have learned to serve;
It lacks the needed fire to glow, it lacks the breeze to nerve.
It cannot drive the world until itself be driven;
Its flag can only be unfurled when Thou shalt breathe from heaven.
My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine;
If it would reach a monarch’s throne, it must its crown resign.
It only stands unbent amid the clashing strife,
When on Thy bosom it has leant, and found in Thee its life.

Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is the love of God flowing through you?
Are you telling the lost of the Savior?
Are you ready His service to do?
Make me a channel of blessing today,
Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
My life possessing, my service blessing,
Make me a channel of blessing today.
Is your life a channel of blessing?
Are you burdened for those that are lost?
Have you urged upon those who are straying,
The Savior Who died on the cross?
Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is it a daily telling for Him?
Have you spoken the Word of salvation
To those who are dying in sin?
We cannot be channels of blessing
If our lives are not free from known sin;
We will barriers be and a hindrance
To those we are trying to win.

Make me a channel of your peace:
Where there is hatred, let me bring you love;
Where there is injury, your healing pow'r,
And where there's doubt, true faith in you.
Make me a channel of your peace:
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope;
Where there is darkness, - only light,
And where there's sadness, ever joy.
O Spirit, grant that I may never seek
So much to be consolded as to console,
To be understood as to understand,
To be loved as to love with all my soul - .
Make me a channel of your peace.
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
In giving to all that we receive,
And in dying that we're born to eternal life.

Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Were cast into a furnace of fire;
The Lord joined them there and all four danced
To music from His heavenly choir.
Make me a miracle too.oh Lord,
Make me a miracle, too;
Create a beautiful masterpiece,
A great work of art.by You!
Twelve disciples cried out from a ship
In the midst of a storm on the sea;
The Lord walked on water to save them,
He climbed on board and the tempest ceased.
Make me a miracle too.oh Lord,
Make me a miracle, too:
Create a beautiful masterpiece,
A great work of art.by You!
A bright light from heaven captured Paul
Because Paul persecuted Christians;
The Lord touched his eyes so he could see,
Then sent Paul on a Christian mission.

The wind and waves obey your voice
I want to be like that
Listening before each choice
I want to be like that
Father hear my humble plea
Help me to be like the ocean that is under Your command
Help me be still, I want to do Your will
Oh Lord, make me a storm
The raging sea did not think twice
I want to be like that
Following without a fight
I want to be like that
O Father hear my humble plea (hear my plea)
Help me to be like the ocean that is under Your command
Help me be still (help me be still), I want to do Your will
Oh Lord, make me a storm
Make me be still (make me be still)
And listen for Your will
Oh Lord, make me a storm

If your own sorrows you want to forget,
Make somebody happy today;
If in your heart you would know no regret,
Make somebody happy today.
Others near by you may be in despair,
Struggling ’neath crosses so heavy to bear;
They may take heart, if you show that you care—
Make somebody happy today.
Make somebody happy today.
O sing a glad song on your way;
The good that you do brings blessing to you,
Make somebody happy today.
If you seek pleasure no trouble can mar,
Make somebody happy today;
You’ll find it waiting you, right where you are,
Make somebody happy today.
Is your life darkened by hopes that were vain?
Go help another his goal to attain!
What you have lost, by your help he may gain—
Make somebody happy today.
Do not complain that you’ve nothing to give,
Make somebody happy today;
Do your whole duty, and preach as you live,
Make somebody happy today.
Though you have only a smile, or a flower,
Give it, and speak of His love, of His power;
You may cheer many a pain-weary hour—
Make somebody happy today.

Make thee ready, as best thou art able,
Little Bethlehem, garnish the bed,
Tho’ it be but a crib in a stable,
Where the Infant may pillow His head,
Where the Infant may pillow His head.
Type and shadow of yore are now ended;
Lo, the substance is come, as I ken;
Truth Incarnate to earth is descended,
God hath pitched His tent among men.
God hath pitched His tent among men.
He is past through the virginal portal;
The Invisible doth not decline
To be found in the fashion of mortal,
For to make human nature divine,
For to make human nature divine.
Wherefore Adam and Eva, forgiven
Their iniquity cry, “By the grace
And goodwill of our Lord are we shriven;
Seen of men, He doth ransom our race;
Seen of men, He doth ransom our race."

Make Your way clearer, help me to know
How You are leading, where I should go
I need much wisdom on what to do
Make Your way clearer, I'll follow You
Your will is perfect, Your plans are good
I trust completely Your strength and love
Make Your way clearer, help us to know
How You are leading, where we should go
We need much wisdom on what to do
Make Your way clearer, we'll follow You
Your will is perfect, Your plans are good
We trust completely Your strength and love
Make Your way clearer, help us to know
How You are leading, where we should go
We need much wisdom on what to do
Make Your way clearer, we'll follow You
Make Your way clearer, we'll follow You

I Maker and sov’reign Lord
Of Heav’n, and earth, and seas,
Thy providence confirms Thy Word,
And answers Thy decrees.
The things so long foretold
By David are fulfill’d,
When Jews and Gentiles join’d to slay
Jesus, Thine holy Child.
Why did the Gentiles rage,
And Jews, with one accord,
Bend all their counsels to destroy
Th’Anointed of the Lord?
Rulers and kings agree
To form a vain design;
Against the Lord their powers unite
Against His Christ they join.
The Lord derides their rage,
And will support His throne;
He that hath rais’d Him from the dead
Hath own’d Him for His Son.
Now He’s ascended high,
And asks to rule the earth;
The merit of His blood He pleads,
And pleads His heav’nly birth.
He asks, and God bestows
A large inheritance;
Far as the world’s remotest ends
His kingdom shall advance.
The nations that rebel
Must feel His iron rod;
He’ll vindicate those honors well
Which He receiv’d from God.
Be wise, ye rulers, now,
And worship at His throne;
With trembling joy, ye people, bow
To God’s exalted Son.
If once His wrath arise,
Ye perish on the place;
Then blessed is the soul that flies
For refuge to His grace.

Maker of earth, to Thee alone
Perpetual rest belongs;
And the bright choirs around Thy throne
May pour their endless songs.
But we—ah holy now no more!
Are doomed to toil and pain;
Yet exiles on an alien shore
May sing their country’s strain.
Father, Whose promise binds Thee still
To heal the suppliant throng,
Grant us to mourn the deeds of ill
That banish us so long.
And, while we mourn, in faith to rest
Upon Thy love and care,
Till Thou restore us with the blest
The song of heaven to share.
O God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Holy Ghost,
To Thee be praise, great Three in One,
From Thy created host.

Maker of man, Who from Thy throne
Dost order all things, God alone;
By Whose decree the teeming earth
To reptile and to beast gave birth:
The mighty forms that fill the land,
Instinct with life at Thy command,
Are giv’n subdued to humankind
For service in their rank assigned.
From all Thy servants drive away
Whate’er of thought impure today
Hath been with open action blent
Or mingled with the heart’s intent.
In Heav’n Thine endless joys bestow,
And grant Thy gifts of grace below;
From chains of strife our souls release,
Bind fast the gentle hands of peace.
O Father, that we ask be done,
Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.

The Maker of the sun and moon,
The Maker of our earth,
Lo! late in time, a fairer boon,
Himself is brought to birth!
How blest was all creation then,
When God so gave increase;
And Christ, to heal the hearts of men,
Brought righteousness and peace!
No star in all the heights of heaven
But burned to see Him go;
Yet unto earth alone was given
His human form to know.
His human form, by man denied,
Took death for human sin:
His endless love, through faith descried,
Still lives the world to win.
O perfect love, outpassing sight,
O light beyond our ken,
Come down through all the world tonight,
And heal the hearts of men!

There was a giant of the philistine nation (nation)
A mighty warrior standing ten feet tall
He shouted boastings that no Israelite could beat him
He was ungodly and as mean as his sin
A boy named David stepped up to the situation
Goliath's threats became a godly call
He chose some stones, and with God's force he started slingin'
He knew by faith the victory he would win
He was a man after God's own heart
He had a faith that set him apart
He showed commitment right from the start
He was a, he was a, he was a man after God's own heart
There was a king of the Israelite nation
Tall, dark and handsome, rich - his name was Saul
Lost his anointing due to sin's impatience
He disobeyed the Lord and next was his fall
The Lord called David to the situation
He was a young man, but he heard God's call
He'd be anointed, he'd be Saul's replacement
To lead God's nation, holy chosen of all
He was a man after God's own heart
Israel surrounded by the heathen nation
Edom and Moab and the Philistines
Their bloody swords dripping annihilation
Numbers and powers seemed they had it all
David the man of God addressed the situation (he prayed)
Gave thanks and praised the Lord all powerful
He stressed his faith among the congregation
Wherever David went the Lord helped him win
Man after God's own heart (he was a man)
He was a man after God's own heart (he was a man, he was a man, he was a man)
The Lord is my Shephard, I shall not want (man after God's own heart)

The man is ever bless’d
Who shuns the sinners’ ways,
Among their councils never stands,
Nor takes the scorner’s place;
But makes the law of God
His study and delight,
Amidst the labors of the day,
And watches of the night.
He like a tree shall thrive,
With waters near the root;
Fresh as the leaf his name shall live;
His works are heav’nly fruit.
Not so th’ungodly race,
They no such blessings find;
Their hopes shall flee, like empty chaff
Before the driving wind.
How will they bear to stand
Before that judgment seat,
Where all the saints, at Christ’s right hand,
In full assembly meet!
He knows, and He approves
The way the righteous go;
But sinners and their works shall meet
A dreadful overthrow.

The man who once has found abode
Within the secret place of God,
Shall with Almighty God abide,
And in His shadow safely hide.
I of the Lord my God will say,
“He is my Refuge and my Stay;
To Him for safety I will flee;
My God, in Him my trust will be."
He shall with all protecting care
Preserve thee from the fowler’s snare;
When fearful plagues around prevail,
No fatal stroke shall thee assail.
His outspread pinions shall thee hide;
Beneath His wings shalt thou confide;
His faithfulness shall ever be
A shield and buckler unto thee.
No nightly terrors shall alarm;
No deadly shaft by day shall harm;
Nor pestilence that walks by night,
Nor plagues that waste in noonday light.
Because thy trust is God alone,
Thy dwelling place the Highest One,
No evil shall upon thee come,
Nor plague approach thy guarded home.
At thy right hand, though thousands die,
No harm shall unto thee come nigh;
But thou, secure, unharmed, shalt see
What wicked men’s reward shall be.

Jesus journeyed through the land
Throughout all Galilee
Healing hearts and souls of people
Just like you and me
From town to town the glory
Of the Father He did share
And news of the Messiah
Quickly spread everywhere
Upon a mountain Jesus stood
And He began to speak
Blessed are the poor in spirit
Blessed are the meek
If you must walk a mile by law
Then walk one more in love
And seek first the Kingdom
Now at hand and from above
Oh listen to the Man on the mountain
From your heart (from your heart) let His love flow like a fountain
As He spoke to His disciples, He speaks to us today
Oh listen to the Man on the mountain
Let your light shine around you
For all the world to see
And where your heart is
So will your treasures be
Do not worry 'bout tomorrow
Or what the day may bring
See the flowers blooming
Hear the birds as they sing
Won't you listen to the man on the mountain

Many and great, O God, are Thy things,
Maker of earth and sky;
Thy hands have set the heavens with stars;
Thy fingers spread the mountains and plains.
Lo, at Thy Word the waters were formed;
Deep seas obey Thy voice.
Grant unto us communion with Thee,
Thou star abiding One;
Come unto us and dwell with us;
With Thee are found the gifts of life,
Bless us with life that has no end,
Eternal life with Thee.

Hear us, O Lord, from Heaven Thy dwelling place:
Like them of old, in vain we toil all night,
Unless with us Thou go, Who art the Light,
Come then, O Lord, that we may see Thy face.
Thou, Lord, doest rule the raging of the sea,
When loud the storm and furious is the gale:
Strong is Thine arm; our little barques are frail:
Send us Thy help; remember Galilee.
Our wives and children we commend to Thee:
For them we plough the land and plough the deep;
For them by day the golden corn we reap,
By night the silver harvest of the sea.
We thank Thee, Lord, for sunshine, dew and rain,
Broadcast from heaven by Thine almighty hand—
Source of all life, unnumbered as the sand—
Bird, beast, and fish, herb, fruit and golden grain.
O Bread of Life, Thou in Thy Word hast said,
Who feeds in faith on Me shall never die!
In mercy hear Thy hungry children’s cry—
Father, give us this day our daily bread!
Sow in our hearts the seeds of Thy dear love,
That we may reap contentment, joy, and peace;
And when at last our earthly labors cease,
Grant us to join Thy harvest home above.

Many in darkness are far astray,
Carry the light, carry the light,
Spreading the beams of the Gospel day,
Carry the beautiful light;
Tell them the gift of the Father’s love,
How the dear Savior He gave;
Tell them of mercy that smiles above,
Jesus almighty to save!
Light! light! beautiful light!
Streaming from heaven’s fair height;
Living for Jesus, our precious Savior,
Carry the beautiful light.
Let us unite in this best employ,
Carry the light, carry the light;
Tell the good news of salvation’s joy,
Carry the beautiful light.
Singing of Jesus, our songs are bright,
Bright with the blessing He brings;
Helping to scatter the shades of night.
Sing of the Lord’s healing wings.
Living for Jesus, we’ll work and pray,
Carry the light, carry the light;
Walking with Him in the shining way,
Carry the beautiful light;
O, there’s a glory that fills the heart,
Sunshine of pardon and peace;
Let us the secret to all impart,
Helping the kingdom’s increase.
Clearer and clearer the dayspring glows,
Carry the light, carry the light;
Brighter and brighter the morning grows,
Carry the beautiful light.
Jesus is coming in wondrous might,
Coming in splendor to reign;
Sorrow and sighing shall take their flight,
Eden shall blossom again.

In days of yore, from Britain’s shore,
Wolfe, the dauntless hero, came
And planted firm Britannia’s flag
On Canada’s fair domain!
Here may it wave, our boast, our pride,
And join in love together,
The Thistle, Shamrock, Rose entwine,
The Maple Leaf forever.
The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear,
The Maple Leaf forever!
God save the King and Heaven bless
The Maple Leaf forever!
At Queenston Heights and Lundy’s lane
Our brave fathers side by side
For freedom’s right and loved ones dear
Firmly stood and nobly died.
And those dear rights which they maintained
We swear to yield them never
Our watchword evermore shall be
The Maple Leaf forever.
Our fair dominion now extends
From Cape Race to Nootka Sound;
May peace forever be our lot
And plenteous store abound;
And may those ties of love be ours
Which discord cannot sever,
And flourish green o’er Freedom’s home
The Maple Leaf forever.
On merry England’s far-famed land
May kind Heaven sweetly smile;
God bless old Scotland evermore
And Ireland’s Emerald isle.
Then swell the song both loud and long,
Till rocks and forest quiver;
“God save our King and Heaven bless
The Maple Leaf forever!"

March on, O soul, with strength!
Like those strong men of old
Who ’gainst enthroned wrong
Stood confident and bold;
Who, thrust in prison or cast to flame
Still made their glory in Thy Name.
The sons of fathers we
By whom our faith is taught
To fear no ill, to fight
The holy fight they fought;
Heroic warriors, ne’er from Christ
By any lure or guile enticed.
March on, O soul, with strength,
As strong the battle rolls!
’Gainst lies and lusts and wrongs,
Let courage rule our souls;
In keenest strife, Lord, may we stand,
Upheld and strengthened by Thy hand.
Not long the conflict: soon
The holy war shall cease,
Faith’s warfare ended, won
The home of endless peace!
Look up! the victor’s crown at length!
March on, O soul, march on, with strength!

March to the battlefield, march on with sword and shield;
March on; the foe shall yield to Christ our King.
Onward, ye faithful band, onward at His command;
Onward, nor halting stand, but loudly sing.
This is the victory, this is the victory,
This is the victory, we sing by the way;
This is the victory, this is the victory,
This is the victory, and faith gains the day.
Stand firm against thy foes; stand, though a host oppose;
Stand! well our Leader knows our conflicts all.
“Fear not," He says to thee, “Fear not, but valiant be,
Fear not, but trust in Me; the foe must fall."
Fight, though thy foes increase; fight, till the dawn of peace;
Fight, till the war shall cease, then shout and sing.
Shout, then triumphantly, shout, shout the victory;
Shout, “Glory be to Thee, O Lord, our King!"

We’re marching home to Canaan’s land,
Marching in the beautiful light of God,
And soon we’ll join the angel band,
Marching in the beautiful light of God.
We are marching in the light,
We are marching in the light,
We are marching in the light,
We are marching in the beautiful light of God.
We’re marching nearer day by day,
Marching in the beautiful light of God,
To that sweet home where loved ones stay,
Marching in the beautiful light of God.
Come march with us to Canaan’s shore,
Marching in the beautiful light of God,
To dwell with Christ forevermore,
Marching in the beautiful light of God.
Around the shining throne we’ll meet,
Marching in the beautiful light of God,
And cast our crowns at Jesus’ feet,
Marching in the beautiful light of God.
Then to a mansion bright and fair!
Marching in the beautiful light of God,
The angels will attend us there,
Marching in the beautiful light of God.

Marching on in the light of God,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Up the path that the Master trod,
Marching, marching on.
A robe of white, a crown of gold,
A harp, a home, a mansion fair,
A victor’s palm, a joy untold,
Are mine when I get there.
Marching on through the hosts of sin,
Marching on I am marching on;
Vict’ry’s mine while I’ve Christ within,
Marching, marching on.
Marching on while the skeptics sneer,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Perfect love casteth out all fear,
Marching, marching on.
Marching on with the flag unfurled,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Preaching Christ to the dying world,
Marching, marching on.

Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.
The sorrows of the mind
Be banished from the place;
Religion never was designed
Religion never was designed,
To make our pleasures less,
To make our pleasures less.
Let those refuse to sing,
Who never knew our God;
But favorites of the heavenly King,
But favorites of the heavenly King
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.
The God that rules on high,
And thunders when He please,
Who rides upon the stormy sky,
Who rides upon the stormy sky,
And manages the seas,
And manages the seas.
This awful God is ours,
Our Father and our Love;
He will send down his heav’nly powers,
He will send down his heav’nly powers,
To carry us above,
To carry us above.
There we shall see His face,
And never, never sin!
There, from the rivers of His grace,
There, from the rivers of His grace,
Drink endless pleasures in,
Drink endless pleasures in.
Yea, and before we rise,
To that immortal state,
The thoughts of such amazing bliss,
The thoughts of such amazing bliss,
Should constant joys create,
Should constant joys create.
The men of grace have found,
Glory begun below.
Celestial fruits on earthly ground
Celestial fruits on earthly ground
From faith and hope may grow,
From faith and hope may grow.
The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.
Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.

Marching with the heroes,
Comrades of the strong,
Lift we hearts and voices
As we march along;
O the joyful music
All in raise!
Theirs the song of triumph,
Ours the song of praise.
Marching with the heroes,
Comrades of the strong,
Lift we hearts and voices
As we march along.
Glory to the heroes,
Who in days of old,
Trod the path of duty,
Faithful, wise and bold;
For the right unflinching,
Strong the weak to save,
Warriors all and freemen,
Fighting for the slave.
So we sing the story
Of the brave and true,
Till among the heroes
We are heroes, too;
Loyal to our Captain
Like the men of yore,
Marching with the heroes,
Onward evermore.

Mark how the Lamb of God's self-offering
our human sinfulness takes on
in the birth-waters of the Jordan
as Jesus is baptized by John.
Hear how the voice from heaven thunders,
 "Lo, this is my beloved Son."
See how in dove-like form
the Spirit descends on God's Anointed One.
From this assurance of God's favor
Jesus goes to the wilderness,
there to endure a time of testing
that readied him to teach and bless.
So we, by water and the Spirit
baptized into Christ's ministry,
are often led to paths of service,
through mazes of adversity.
Grant us, O God, the strength and courage
to live the faith our lips declare;
bless us in our baptismal calling;
Christ's royal priesthood help us share.
Turn us from every false allegiance,
that we may trust in Christ alone;
raise up in us a chosen people
transformed by love to be your own.

Martyr of God, whose strength was steeled
To follow close God’s only Son,
Well didst thou brave thy battlefield,
And well thy heavenly bliss was won!
Now join thy prayers with ours, who pray
That God may pardon us and bless;
For prayer keeps evil’s plague away,
And draws from life its weariness.
Long, long ago, were loosed the chains
That held thy body once in thrall;
For us how many a bond remains!
O Love of God release us all.
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise to Thee, eternal Son;
All praise, O Holy Ghost, to Thee
While never ending ages run.

Christmas was a gift, given many years ago
To an undeserving world, on a night so dark and cold
God became a child, deity within a babe
Man was given hope, man can be saved
And the angels must have marveled at what the Lord had done
God in flesh and blood, Emmanuel, God the Son
Born in a dirty stable, for there was no room at the inn
For a lowly child that became the man that would free the world from sin
The shepherds stood in awe, invited by an angel choir
Singing glory unto God, and telling of the Savior's birth
Could they really understand, the child had brought a better way?
A bridge from God to man, man can be saved
And the child grew and became a man
A cross and nails then captured His hands
Could it be that God had died?
The sun grew dark and nature cried
And the angels must have marveled at what the Lord had done
God in flesh and blood, Emmanuel, God the Son (He is the only Son)
Born in a dirty stable, and on a cross this child would end
But He could not stay, the stone was rolled away, as He freed the world from sin
No He could not stay, the stone was rolled away, as He freed the world from sin

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilled.
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin.
Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, the mighty cross.
Dark is the stain that we cannot hide.
What can we do to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide,
Brighter than snow you may be today.
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe!
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?

Mary came unto the tomb of Jesus,
the stone was moved, the Lord had gone away,
the angels said "Fear Not, I know whom seek ye"
"But He is Risen" this she heard him say.
GONE, THE STONE'S BEEN ROLLED BACK,
GONE, THE TOMBIS EMPTY,
GONE TO SIT AT THE FATHER'S SIDE,
GONE, OVER DEATH TRIUMPHANT,
GONE, SIN IS DEFEATED,
GONE, HE LIVES FOR EVER-MORE
My friend, if you don't know my Risen Savior,
I beg of you, don't wait to late to pray,
don't wait until his bride has been completed
don't wait until you hear him say, "it's too late"

Mary did you know, that your baby boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary did you know, that your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know, that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This Child that you delivered,
Will soon deliver you!
Mary did you know, that your baby boy
Will give sight to the blind man?
Mary did you know, that your baby boy
Would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know, that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod
And when you kiss your little baby,
You've kissed the face of God?
Oh, Mary did you know?
Mary did you know?
The blind will see, the deaf will hear,
The dead will live again,
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
Praises of the Lamb?
Mary did you know, that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know, that your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know, that your baby boy
Was Heaven's perfect Lamb?
And this sleeping Child you're holding
Is the Great I AM

The virgin Mary had a baby boy,
the virgin Mary had a baby boy,
the virgin Mary had a baby boy,
and they say that his name is Jesus.
He come from the glory,
he come from the glorious kingdom.
He come from the glory,
he come from the glorious kingdom.
Oh, yes! believer! Oh, yes! believer!
He come from the glory,
he come from the glorious kingdom.
The angels sang with the baby was born,
the angels sang with the baby was born,
the angels sang with the baby was born,
and they say that his name is Jesus.
The shepherds came where the baby was born,
the shepherds came where the baby was born,
the shepherds came where the baby was born,
and they say that his name is Jesus.
The Wise Men came where the baby was born,
the Wise Men came where the baby was born,
the Wise Men came where the baby was born,
and they say that his name is Jesus.

Mary to her Savior’s tomb
Hasted at the early dawn;
Spice she brought, and sweet perfume,
But the Lord, the Loved, was gone.
For awhile she weeping stood,
Struck with sorrow and surprise;
Shedding tears, a plenteous flood,
For her heart supplied her eyes.
Jesus, Who is always near,
Though too often unperceived
Came, His drooping child to cheer,
And inquired, Why she grieved?
Though at first she knew Him not,
When He called her by her name,
Then her griefs were all forgot,
For she found He was the same.
Grief and sighing quickly fled
When she heard His welcome voice;
Just before she thought Him dead,
Now He bids her heart rejoice:
What a change His Word can make,
Turning darkness into day!
You who weep for Jesus’ sake;
He will wipe your tears away.
He Who came to comfort her,
When she thought her all was lost;
Will for your relief appear,
Though you now are tempest-tossed:
On His Word your burden cast,
On His love your thoughts employ;
Weeping for awhile may last,
But the morning brings the joy.

Mary, weep not, weep no longer,
now thy heart hath gained its goal;
here, in truth, the Gardener standeth,
but the Gardener of thy soul,
who within thy spirit's garden
by his love hath made thee whole.
Now from grief and lamentation
lift thy drooping heart with cheer;
while for love of him thou mournest,
lo, thy Lord regained is here;
fainting for him, thou hast found him;
all unknown, behold him near!
Whence thy sorrow, whence thy weeping,
since with thee true bliss abides?
In thy heart, thou undiscovered,
balm of consolation hides:
holding all, thou canst no longer
lack the cure that health provides.
Nay, no wonder if she knows not
till the Sower's seed be sown,
till from him, the Word eternal,
light within her heart is thrown.
Lo, he calls her; lo, "Rabboni,"
she in turn her Lord doth own.
Faith that washed the feet of Jesus,
fed with dew the Fount of Grace,
win for us a like compassion,
that, with all the ransomed race,
at the glory of his rising
we may see him face to face!
Glory be to God and honor,
who, preferring sacrifice,
far above the rich man's bounty,
sweetness found in Mary's sighs,
who for all, his love foretasting,
spreads the banquet of the skies.

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the holy Bible say
Mary's Boy child, Jesus Christ
Was Born on Christmas day
Hark now hear the Angels sing
A king was born to day
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Mary's Boy child, Jesus Christ
Was Born on Christmas day
While shepherds watched their flock by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song
The music seemed to come from afar
Hark now hear the Angels sing
A king was born to day
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
For a moment the world was aglow
All the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted let ev'ryone know
There is hope for all to find peace
(Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,
Came to Bethlehem that night,
they found no place to bear her child,

Is this the boy I raised
Is this the son I knew
Is this the one I loved
Why can't they love Him too
What has my son ever done to you
Has he caused you some pain
As I recall all He's shown is love
Why can't you show Him the same
This is the boy I raised (this is the boy I raised)
This is the son I knew (this is the son I knew)
This is the one I've loved (this is the one I've loved)
Why can't they love Him too
Oh what can I do, my son
Why can't they see what I know
Is this the way it must be
Is this the way you must go (is this the way you must go)
I'd gladly die in your place
If I could save you some pain
But I can see in your face
My death would not be the same
You are the boy I raised
You are the son I knew
You are the one I've loved
Why can't they love You too

The Master comes! He calls for thee—
Go forth at His almighty word,
Obedient to His last command,
And tell to those who never heard,
Who sit in deepest shades of night,
That Christ has come to give them light.
The Master calls! Arise and go;
How blest His messenger to be!
He, Who hath given thee liberty,
Now bids thee set the captives free;
Proclaim His mighty power to save,
Who for the world His lifeblood gave.
The Master calls! Shall not thy heart
In warm responsive love reply,
“Lord, here am I; send me, send me,
Thy willing slave, to live or die—
An instrument unfit indeed,
Yet Thou wilt give me what I need"?
And if thou canst not go, yet bring
An offering of a willing heart;
Then, though thou tarriest at home,
Thy God shall give thee too thy part;
The messengers of peace upbear
In ceaseless and prevailing prayer.
Short is the time for service true,
For soon shall dawn that glorious day
When, all the harvest gathered in,
Each faithful heart shall hear Him say,
“My child, well done! your toil is o’er—
Enter My joy forevermore."

The Master hath come, and He calls us to follow
The track of the footprints He leaves on our way;
Far over the mountain and through the deep hollow,
The path leads us on to the mansions of day:
The Master hath called us, the children who fear Him,
Who march ’neath Christ’s banner, His own little band;
We love Him and seek Him, we long to be near Him,
And rest in the light of His beautiful land.
The Master hath called us; the road may be dreary
And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;
But God’s Holy Spirit shall comfort the weary;
We follow the Savior and cannot turn back;
The Master hath called us, though doubt and temptation
May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing:
“Press onward, look upward," through much tribulation;
The children of Zion must follow the King.
The Master hath called us, in life’s early morning,
With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:
We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning,
To cast in our lot with the people of God:
The Master hath called us, His sons and His daughters,
We plead for His blessing and trust in His love;
And through the green pastures, beside the still waters,
He’ll lead us at last to His kingdom above.

Master, speak! Thy servant heareth,
Waiting for Thy gracious word,
Longing for Thy voice that cheereth;
Master! let it now be heard.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee:
What hast Thou to say to me?
Speak to me by name, O Master,
Let me know it is to me;
Speak, that I may follow faster,
With a step more firm and free,
Where the Shepherd leads the flock,
In the shadow of the rock.
Master, speak! Though least and lowest,
Let me not unheard depart;
Master, speak! For O, Thou knowest
All the yearning of my heart,
Knowest all its truest need:
Speak! and make me blest indeed.
Master, speak! and make me ready,
When Thy voice is truly heard,
With obedience glad and steady
Still to follow every word.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee:
Master, speak! O, speak to me!

Master, no offering costly and sweet,
May we, like Magdalene, lay at Thy feet;
Yet may love’s incense rise, sweeter than sacrifice,
Dear Lord to Thee, dear Lord to Thee.
Daily our lives would show weakness made strong,
Toilsome and gloomy ways brightened by song;
Some deeds of kindness done, some souls by patience won,
Dear Lord to Thee, dear Lord to Thee.
Some word of hope for hearts burdened with fears,
Some balm of peace for eyes blinded with tears,
Some dews of mercy shed, some wayward footsteps led,
Dear Lord to Thee, dear Lord to Thee.
Thus, in Thy service, Lord, till eventide
Closes the day of life may we abide;
And when earth’s labors cease, bid us depart in peace,
Dear Lord to Thee, dear Lord to Thee.

Master, the tempest is raging!
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o’ershadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh;
Carest Thou not that we perish?
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?
The winds and the waves obey Thy will,
Peace, be still!
Whether the wrath of the storm tossed sea,
Or demons or men, or whatever it be
No waters can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will,
Peace, be still! Peace, be still!
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will,
Peace, peace, be still!
Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled
Oh, waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o’er my sinking soul;
And I perish! I perish! dear Master
Oh, hasten, and take control.
Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth’s sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven’s within my breast;
Linger, O blessed Redeemer!
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore.

Master, we Thy footsteps follow,
We Thy Word obey,
Hear us, Thy dear Name confessing,
While we pray.
Now into Thy death baptized,
We ourselves would be
Dead to all the sin that made
Thy Calvary.
Rising with Thee, make us like Thee,
In Thy love and care,
In Thy zeal, and in Thy labor,
And Thy prayer.
Let the love that knows no failing
Cast out all our fears,
Let Thy pure and faithful Spirit
Fill our years.
Till we hear the trumpets sounding
On the other side,
And forever, in Thy Heaven
We abide.

The Master is come, and calleth for thee,
He stands at the door of thy heart,
No friend so forgiving, so gentle as He,
Oh, say, wilt thou let Him depart?
Patiently waiting, earnestly pleading,
Jesus, thy Savior, knocks at thy heart,
Patiently waiting, earnestly pleading,
Jesus, thy Savior, knocks at thy heart.
The Master has come, with blessings for thee,
Arise, and His message receive;
Thy ransom is purchased, thy pardon is free,
If thou wilt repent and believe.
The Master has come, and calleth thee now,
This moment what joy may be thine;
How tender that smile that illumines His brow,
A pledge of His favor divine.
He waits for thee still, then haste with delight,
Oh, fly to the arms of His love;
Press on to that beautiful mansion of light,
Prepared in His kingdom above.

May God bestow on us His grace,
With blessings rich provide us,
And may the brightness of His face
To life eternal guide us
That we His saving health may know,
His gracious will and pleasure,
And also to the heathen show
Christ’s riches without measure
And unto God convert them.
Thine over all shall be the praise
And thanks of every nation,
And all the world with joy shall raise
The voice of exultation;
For Thou shalt judge the earth, O Lord,
Nor suffer sin to flourish;
Thy people’s pasture is Thy Word
Their souls to feed and nourish,
In righteous paths to keep them.
Oh, let the people praise Thy worth,
In all good works increasing;
The land shall plenteous fruit bring forth,
Thy Word is rich in blessing,
May God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit bless us!
Let all the world praise Him alone,
Let solemn awe possess us,
Now let our hearts say, Amen.

In the warfare that is raging
For the truth and for the right,
When the conflict fierce is raging
With the powers of the night,
God needs people brave and true;
May He then depend on you?
May the Lord depend on you?
Loyalty is but His due;
Say, O spirit brave and true,
That He may depend on you!
See, they come on sable pinions,
Come in strong Satanic might,
Powers come and dark dominions
From the regions of the night.
God requires the brave and true;
May He then depend on you?
From His throne the Father sees us;
Angels help us to prevail;
And our Leader true is Jesus,
And we shall not, cannot fail.
Triumph crowns the brave and true;
May the Lord depend on you?

May the mind of Christ, my Savior,
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and power controlling
All I do and say.
May the Word of God dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His power.
May the peace of God my Father
Rule my life in everything,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.
May the love of Jesus fill me
As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.
May I run the race before me,
Strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus
As I onward go.
May His beauty rest upon me,
As I seek the lost to win,
And may they forget the channel,
Seeing only Him.

May Thy Church our shelter be,
Ark in mercy built by Thee,
Refuge from the storms of life,
From the wearing toil and strife,
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
When temptations round us roll,
Threatening shipwreck to the soul,
Grant us faith and holy fear,
By Thy will our course to steer.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
Through the gloom of sorrow’s night,
Show Thy cheering, guiding light;
Waft us homeward, Lord, we pray,
Nearer Heaven, day by day.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
Bid the storms of passion cease,
Bid the power of love increase,
Bid each tossing doubt be still,
Bid us trust and do Thy will.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
Mark our course, and keep us true,
Till the haven fair we view,
Grant us on that peaceful shore
Home and friends forevermore.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.
Where there is no night or sea,
May we praise and worship Thee,
Glad because we are at rest,
In Thy presence with the blest.
Hear us, we beseech Thee.

Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak, but He is strong
Is your burden heavy as you bear it all alone
Does the road you travel harbor danger yet unknown
Are you growing weary in the struggle of it all
Jesus will help you when on His name you call
He is always there, hearing every prayer faithful and true
Walking by our side, in His love we hide all the day through
When you get discouraged just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus, He's reaching out to you
I keep falling in love with Him over and over and over and over again
I keep falling in love with Him over and over and over and over again
He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by, oh what a love between my Lord
and I
I keep falling in love with Him over and over and over and over again
Tell me the story of Jesus
Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard
Tell how the angels in
Sang as they welcomed His birth
“Glory to God in the highest!
Peace and good tidings to earth"
Tell me the story of Jesus
Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so

Sweet is the song (sweet is the song) I'm singing today (I'm singing today)
I'm redeemed! (I'm redeemed!), I'm redeemed! (I'm redeemed!)
Troubles and sorrow (troubles and sorrow) have vanished away (have vanished
away)
(I have been) I have been redeemed (redeemed)
I'm redeemed (I'm redeemed) by love divine (by love divine)
Oh glory, glory, Christ is mine, Christ is mine (Christ is mine)
All to Him (all to Him) I now resign (I now resign)
(I have been) I have been redeemed (redeemed)
Precious indeed (precious indeed) is my Savior to me (is my Savior to me)
For I'm redeemed! (I'm redeemed!), I'm redeemed! (I'm redeemed!)
Happy in glory (happy in glory) some day I shall be (some day I shall be)
(I have been) I have been redeemed (redeemed)
How I love the great Redeemer
Who is doing so much for me
With what joy I tell the story
Of the love that makes men free
'Til my earthly life is ended
I will send (I will send) songs above (songs above)
Then beside the crystal sea
More and more my soul shall be
Praising Jesus and His love
He is ev’rything to me, to me
He is ev’rything to me
And ev’rything shall always be
I will never cease to raise
A song of gladness in His praise
Here and in the world above
My soul shall sing of saving love
Life and light and joy is He
The precious Friend who died for me
Glory be to Him forever
Endless praises to Christ the Lamb
He has filled my life with sunshine
He has made me what I am
O that ev’ry one would know Him
O that all (O that all) would adore (would adore)
O that all would trust the love
Of the mighty Friend above
And be His forever more
(I have been) I have been redeemed (redeemed)

This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres
This is my Father's world; I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas, His hand the wonders wrought
The sands of time are sinking
The dawn of heaven breaks
The summer morn I've sighed for
The fair, sweet morn awakes
Dark, dark hath been the midnight
But day-spring is at hand
And glory, glory dwelleth In Immanuel's land
This is my Father's world; O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet
Spoken Vocal:
O Christ, He is the fountain
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted
More deep I'll drink above
There, to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand
And glory dwelleth In Immanuel's land
With mercy and with judgment
My web of time He wove
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were brightened by His love
And glory, glory dwelleth In Immanuel's land
This is my Father's world, the battle is not done
Jesus who died shall be satisfied, and earth and heav'n be one
And glory, glory dwelleth In Immanuel's land
Amen

Meet and right it is to sing
In every time and place,
Glory to our heavenly King,
The God of truth and grace:
Join we then with sweet accord,
All in one thanksgiving join,
Holy, holy, holy Lord
Eternal praise be Thine!
Thee, the first-born sons of light,
In choral symphonies,
Praise by day, day without night,
And never, never cease:
Angels and archangels all
Praise the mystic Three in One;
Sing, and stop, and gaze, and fall
O’erwhelmed before Thy throne.
Vying with that happy choir,
Who chant Thy praise above,
We on eagles’ wings aspire,
The wings of faith and love;
Thee they sing with glory crowned,
We extol the slaughtered Lamb;
Lower if our voices sound,
Our subject is the same.
Father God, Thy love we praise,
Which gave Thy Son to die;
Jesus, full of truth and grace,
Alike we glorify;
Spirit, Comforter divine,
Praise by all to Thee be given;
Till we in full join,
And earth is turned to Heaven.

We are marching onward to the heav'nly land,
To meet each other in the morning;
We are pressing forward to the golden strand,
Where joy will crown us in the morning.
In the morning, in the morning,
We will gather with the faithful in the morning;
Where the night of sorrow shall be rolled away,
And joy will crown us in the morning.
We are trav'ling onward from a world of care,
To meet each other in the morning;
Oh, the time is coming, we shall soon be there,
And joy will crown us in the morning.
We are trav'ling onward, and the way grows bright,
We'll meet each other in the morning;
Where our friends are waiting, at the gate of life,
And joy will crown us in the morning.
Where the hills are blooming on the other shore,
We'll meet each other in the morning!
Where the heart's deep longing will be felt no more,
And joy will crown us in the morning.
In the boundless rapture of a Savior's love
We'll meet each other in the morning;
Then we'll sing His glory in the realms above,
And joy will crown us in the morning.

Will you meet me in the Homeland,
Shall we both reach Heav’n at last,
When the training days are ended,
And life’s journeys all are past?
Will you meet me there?
Will you meet me there?
’Tis the Savior bids you come;
Will you meet me there?
Will you meet me there?
He can take us safely home.
Will you meet me in the glory,
Shall we both together stand
’Mid the company of saved ones,
In that blood-bought, happy band?
We are never sure of meeting
Anywhere beneath the sun,
But we look for glad reunion,
When our earthly life is done.
He has promised soon to take me
Where the King shall fill my gaze,
Will your voice with mine be blended
In that perfect hymn of praise?

On the happy, golden shore, where the faithful part no more,
When the storms of life are over, meet me there;
Where the night dissolves away into pure and perfect day,
I am going home to stay—meet me there.
Meet me there, meet me there,
Where the tree of life is blooming, meet me there;
When the storms of life are o’er, on the happy golden shore,
Where the faithful part no more, meet me there.
Here our fondest hopes are vain, dearest links are rent in twain,
But in Heav’n no throb of pain—meet me there;
By the river sparkling bright in the city of delight,
Where our faith is lost in sight, meet me there.
Where the harps of angels ring, and the blest forever sing,
In the palace of the King, meet me there;
Where in sweet communion blend heart with heart and friend with friend,
In a world that ne’er shall end, meet me there.

In a lonely churchyard, many miles away,
Lies your dear old mother, ’neath the cold, cold clay;
Mem’ries oft returning of her tears and sighs,
If you love your mother, meet her in the skies.
Listen to her pleading, “Wand’ring boy, come home,"
Lovingly, entreating, do not longer roam;
Let your manhood waken, heav’nward lift your eyes;
If you love your mother, meet her in the skies.
Now the old home, vacant, has no charms for you;
One dear form is absent, mother, kind and true;
Evermore she dwells where pleasure never dies,
If you love your mother, meet her in the skies.
Now in true repentance to the Savior flee,
He Who pardoned mother, mercy has for thee;
Now He waits to comfort, He will not despise,
If you love your mother, meet her in the skies.

Members of Christ are we;
He is our living Head.
That henceforth we should ever be
By His good Spirit led
In the same narrow path
Our Lord and Savior trod—
The path that leadeth by the cross
To glory and to God.
Children of God are we;
Such grace to us is given,
To kneel and pray in Christ’s own words,
“Father, Which art in Heav’n";
Seeking to do His will
As angels do above,
And walking in obedient ways
Of holy truth and love.
Of Heaven’s kingdom we
Inheritors were made;
Each at the font in Christ’s own robe
Of spotless white arrayed.
Upon our forehead now
Is traced the suffering sign,
That one day on each saintly brow
A glorious crown may shine.
Christ’s little ones are we;
And unto us are given
Angelic guards, who ever see
Our Father’s face in Heav’n.
To walk in folly now
We may not, must not, dare,
Mindful Whose seal is on our brow,
Whose holy Name we bear.

Each cooing dove and sighing bough,
That makes the eve so blessed to me,
Has something far diviner now,
It bears me back to Galilee.
O Galilee, sweet Galilee,
Where Jesus loved so much to be,
O Galilee, blue Galilee,
Come sing thy song again to me.
Each flowery glen and mossy dell,
Where happy birds in song agree,
Through sunny morn the praises tell
Of sights and sounds in Galilee.
And when I read the thrilling lore
Of Him Who walked upon the sea,
I long, oh, how I long once more
To follow Him in Galilee.

Men and children everywhere,
With sweet music fill the air!
Nations, come, your voices raise
To the Lord in hymns of praise!
Join the angel song,
All the worlds to Him belong!
Holy, holy,
To our God all glory be!
Morning, evening, bless His Name,
Skies with crimson clouds aflame,
Rainbow arch, His covenant sign,
Countless stars by night that shine!
Through His far domain,
Love is King where He doth reign!
Storm and flood and ocean’s roar,
Breakers crashing on the shore,
Waterfalls that never sleep,
Towering mountain, canyon deep,
Tell ye forth His might,
Lord of life and truth and right!

Men who walk in folly’s way,
And to evil turn aside,
Find that sorrow will repay
Those who wisdom’s laws have defied;
Down to death’s dark portals led,
They abhor their daily bread.
To Jehovah then they cry
In their trouble and He saves,
Sends compassionate reply
Gives the health their spirit craves,
Rescues them with gracious aid
From the snares their folly led.
Sons of men, awake to praise
God the Lord Who reigns above,
Gracious in His works and ways,
Wondrous in redeeming love;
Let them all thank-offerings bring,
Celebrate His deeds, and sing.

In the temple court on a normal day
Is where a Pharisee and tax collector started to pray (started to pray, started to pray, started to pray)
He couldn't think at all of anybody else
So the Pharisee decided he would pray of himself (nobody else, he'd pray of himself)
He thought, Lord before I thank you now for what I've got
I'd like to thank you just a little bit for who I am not (thank you Lord I'm not like the sinners, all the other sinners, all the other sinners)
I'm not a robber or a thief, evil I could never be
An adulterer is surely anybody but me (surely anybody but me)
You see I fast a lot, and well I've got the strength
And I'm proud to say I give a liberal tenth (I'm so proud to be recognized for what I am not)
And at the back of the temple in a humble spread,
The tax collector bowed
He wouldn't raise his head
He said 
(Have mercy on me) Lord have mercy on me a sinner, a sinner (sinner)
(Cause I wanna be free) I just wanna be free, deliver, deliver
(Sinful dilemma) Got myself in a sinful dilemma, dilemma
(You can set my soul free forever) But you can set my soul free forever
(Have mercy on me) Lord have mercy on me a sinner, a sinner (sinner)
(Cause I wanna be free) I just wanna be free, deliver, deliver
(Sinful dilemma) Got myself in a sinful dilemma, dilemma
(You can set my soul free forever) But you can set my soul free forever
Said I need some mercy
Hey, I'm pleadin', I'm beggin'
Hey, said I need some mercy
I'm a sinner but I wanna be free
Have mercy on me
Please
Have mercy on me, on me
Will you have mercy.

I'm going there (going there)
To heaven some day (going to heaven some day)
I'm going home (going home)
He'll show me the way (showing me, showing the way)
In my heart sometimes I ponder
As down life's road I wander
To a city over yonder
Where peace and love abide
Where my trials are gone forever
And the tears will find me never
You'll see (you'll see) that there'll be (there'll be) a place for me
And I'm going there some day (there some day)
I have started for a city (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
That is free from shame and pity (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
It's a bright eternal city (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
And I am traveling on my way (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
Some day I'll have to leave you (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
Don't you let my parting grieve you (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
You'll see (you'll see) that there'll be (there'll be) a place for me
And I'm going there some day (there some day)
Dear Lord look down upon me (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
And Lord (won't you) have mercy on me (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
I am just a weary pilgrim (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
Lord I am tired and (I am) so forlorn (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
Lord I (I want to) thank you for your blessings (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
And for all that I'm possessing (mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord, mercy Lord)
You'll see (you'll see) that there'll be (there'll be) a place for me
And I'm going there some day (there some day)
Mercy Lord

Merry Christmas
Christ was born let's celebrate
Merry Christmas
God sent love to show the way
Merry Christmas
Shout the news to every land
Merry Christmas
A Savior's born in Bethlehem
Giving the gift of love through Christ His son
Shining a star far to the east
Pointing the way to where Immanuel lay
Guiding them to the Prince of Peace
Heavenly hosts appeared to men that night
Praising the Lord and saying this (peace on earth)
Let there be peace on earth to men tonight
On whom His favor rests
Herod the king heard of the Savior's birth
Claiming, "I must go worship Him"
Calling together wise men to come forth
All in search of the King of Kings
Reaching the place of the newborn baby child
Humble, they fell on bended knee
Offering gifts of incense, myrrh, and gold
To lay at Jesus' feet
Merry Christmas
Bring Him your gift of love and say
Merry Christmas
Bow before our King today
Little did they know (little did they know)
Christ would be King (He'd take care of it)
Giving the greatest gift of love
As He took away their sins (took it away)
Merry Christmas
So when you think of how this all began
A celebration seems just right
Sing hallelujah on this Christmas day
We've been given the gift of life
Given the gift, the gift, the gift of life
Given the gift, the gift, the gift of life
Given the gift, the gift, the gift of life
Given the gift, the gift, the gift of life
Merry Christmas (given the gift, the gift, the gift of life)
(Given the gift, the gift, the gift of life)
Merry Christmas (given the gift, the gift, the gift of life)
(Given the gift, the gift, the gift of life)
Merry Christmas (given the gift, the gift, the gift of life)
(Given the gift, the gift, the gift of life)
Merry Christmas

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light (merry little Christmas)
From now on your troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let the music play
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the Lord allows
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Merry, merry chiming bells,
Clear and sweet their carol swells,
Joyful news their music tells,
Glory in the highest:
Glory be to God on high,
Glory in the highest.
In a manger far away,
Once the infant Savior lay;
We will sing His birth today,
Glory in the highest:
Let the glorious tidings fly,
Angels sing, and earth reply;
Glory be to God on high!
Glory in the highest:

Messiah, Prince of peace!
Where men each other tear,
Where war is learned, they must confess,
Thy kingdom is not there.
Who, prompted by Thy foe,
Delight in human blood,
Apollyon is their king, we know,
And Satan is their god.
But shall he still devour
The souls redeemed by Thee?
Jesus, stir up Thy glorious power
And end the apostasy!
Come, Savior, from above,
O’er all our hearts to reign;
And plant the kingdom of Thy love
In every heart of man.
Then shall we exercise
The hellish art no more,
While Thou our long-lost paradise
Dost with Thyself restore.
Fightings and wars shall cease,
And, in Thy Spirit giv’n,
Pure joy and everlasting peace
Shall turn our earth to Heav’n.

’Mid all the traffic of the ways,
Turmoils without, within,
Make in my heart a quiet place,
And come and dwell therein.
A little shrine of quietness,
All sacred to Thyself,
Where Thou shalt all my soul possess,
And I may find myself.
A little shelter from life’s stress,
Where I may lay me prone,
And bare my soul in loneliness,
And know as I am known.
A little place of mystic grace,
Of self and sin swept bare,
Where I may look upon Thy face,
And talk with Thee in prayer.

'Mid Scenes of Confusion and Creature Complaints
How sweet to my soul is communion with saints!
To find at the banquet of mercy there's room.
And feel in the presence of Jesus at home!
Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
Prepare me, dear Savior, for glory my home.
Sweet bonds that unite all the children of peace,
And thrice blessed Jesus, whose love can not cease;
Though oft from the presence in sadness I roam,
I long to behold thee in glory at home;
Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
Prepare me, dear Savior, for glory my home.
I sigh from this body of sin to be free,
Which hinders my joy and communion with thee;
Though now my temptations like billows may foam,
All, all will be peace when I'm with thee
Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
Prepare me, dear Savior, for glory my home.
While here in the valley of conflict I stay,
O give me submission and strength as my day;
In all my afflictions to thee I would come,
Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
Prepare me, dear Savior, for glory my home.
Whate'er thou deniest, O give me thy grace,
The Spirit's sure witness to wait at thy throne,
Indulge me with patience to wait at thy throne,
And find even now a foretaste of my home;
Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
Prepare me, dear Savior, for glory my home.
I long, dearest Lord, in thy beauties to shine,
No more as an exile in sorrow to pine;
And in thy dear image arise from the tomb,
With glorified millions to praise thee at home;
Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
Prepare me, dear Savior, for glory my home.

Mighty and awesome,
faithful and good
Gracious, compassionate,
righteous and just (repeat)
So slow to anger,
abounding in love
You're such a great and
forgiving God
So slow to anger,
abounding in love
You're such a great and
forgi - ving God (repeat)

Mighty army of the young,
Lift your voice in cheerful song,
Send the welcome word along,
Jesus lives!
Once He died for you and me,
Bore our sins upon the tree,
Now He lives to make us free,
Jesus lives!
Wait not till the shadows lengthen, till you older grow,
Rally now and sing for Jesus, ev’rywhere you go;
Lift your joyful voices high,
Ringing clear thro’ earth and sky,
Let the blessed tidings fly,
Jesus lives!
Voice of youth so glad and free,
Sing your song of victory;
Sing to all on land and sea,
Jesus lives!
Light for you and all mankind,
Sight of all by sin made blind,
Life in Jesus all may find,
Jesus lives!
Jesus lives, O blessed words!
King of kings, and Lord of lords!
Lift the cross and sheathe the swords,
Jesus lives!
See, He breaks the prison wall,
Throws aside the dreadful pall,
Conquers death at once for all,
Jesus lives!

Mighty God, come build Your mighty Church upon Your mighty Word!
In the ears of an astounded world, make all Your Wisdom heard!
Let Your apostolic teaching forge in us a bond of awe,
As Your people come together, seeing more than Moses saw:
Not in cloud, or fiery pillar, come now to make us one,
But in Word made flesh come show Yourself, through Your Eternal Son!
As we praise Your name together and worship all You are,
By the broken bread of Your own flesh, come heal our every scar!
In a life-transforming wonder, enter to show forth Your name.
Come engrave on our new hearts this Love that You proclaim.
Work a miracle of fellowship among us as we pray,
Open up our hearts to meet the needs we lift to You today.
With great gladness and sincerity we praise our God and King,
Seeing in our trials and triumphs His hand in everything.
And whether this world hates us or whether it may smile,
We will trust a sovereign mercy to be working all the while
To augment the glorious choir that sings in realms of endless day
Of amazing and unbounded love that never fades away.

The mighty God, Jehovah, speaks
And calls the earth from sea to sea;
From beauteous Zion God shines forth,
He comes and will not silent be;
Devouring flame before Him goes,
And dark the tempest round Him grows.
He calls aloud to Heaven and earth
That He may justly judge His own:
My chosen saints together bring
Who sacrifice to Me alone;
The heav’ns His righteousness declare,
For God Himself as Judge is there.
Hear, O My people, I will speak,
Against thee I will testify;
Give ear to Me, O Israel,
For God, thy covenant God, am I;
I do not spurn thy sacrifice,
Thy offerings are before My eyes.
I will receive from out thy fold
No offering for My holy shrine;
The cattle on a thousand hills
And all the forest beasts are Mine;
Each mountain bird to Me is known,
Whatever roams the field I own.
Behold, if I should hungry grow,
I would not tell My need to thee,
For all the world itself is Mine,
And all its wealth belongs to Me;
Why should I aught of thee receive,
My thirst or hunger to relieve?
Bring thou to God the gifts of thanks,
And pay thy vows to God Most High;
Call ye upon My holy Name
In days when sore distress is nigh;
Deliverance I will send to thee,
And praises thou shalt give to Me.

Mighty God, while angels bless Thee,
May a mortal sing Thy Name?
Lord of men as well as angels,
Thou art every creature’s theme.
Lord of every land and nation,
Ancient of eternal days.
Sounded through the wide creation
Be Thy just and endless praise.
For the grandeur of Thy nature,
Grand beyond a seraph’s thought;
For the wonders of creation,
Works with skill and kindness wrought.
For Thy providence, that governs,
Through Thine empire’s wide domain,
Wings an angel, guides a sparrow,
Blessed be Thy gentle reign.
For Thy rich, Thy free redemption,
Bright, though veiled in darkness long,
Thought is poor, and poor expression;
Who can sing that wondrous song?
Brightness of the Father’s glory,
Shall Thy praise unuttered lie?
Break, my tongue, such guilty silence!
Sing the Lord Who came to die.
From the highest throne of glory
To the cross of deepest woe,
All to ransom guilty captives;
Flow my praise, forever flow!
Reascend, immortal Savior;
Leave Thy footstool, take Thy throne;
Thence return, and reign forever,
Be the kingdom all Thine own!

Mighty is our God
Mighty is our King
Mighty is our Lord
(He's the) Ruler of ev'rything
(Sing glory)
Glory to our God (Glory to our King)
Glory to our King (Glory to our Lord)
Glory to our Lord
(For He's the) Ruler of ev'rything
His name is higher
Higher than any other name
His pow'r is greater
For He has created everything (oh everything)
Mighty is our God (oh mighty)
Mighty is our King (Mighty is our Lord)
Mighty is our Lord
(For He's the) Ruler of ev'rything
(He's the) Ruler of ev'rything
(For He's the) Ruler of ev'rything

Mighty Lord, extend Thy kingdom,
Be the truth with triumph crowned;
Let the lands that sit in darkness
Hear the glorious Gospel sound,
From our borders
To the world’s remotest bound.
By Thine arm, eternal Father,
Scatter far the shades of night;
Let the great Immanuel’s kingdom
Open like the morning light;
Let all barriers
Yield before Thy heavenly might.
Come in all Thy Spirit’s power;
Come, Thy reign on earth restore;
In Thy strength ride forth and conquer,
Still advancing more and more,
Till all people
Shall Thy holy Name adore.

Mighty Rock, whose tow’ring form
Looks above the frowning storm,
Rock amid the desert waste,
To Thy shadow now I haste.
Unto Thee, unto Thee,
Precious Savior, now I flee;
“Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
Of the springs that from Thee burst,
Let me drink and quench my thirst;
Weary, fainting, toil-oppressed,
In Thy shadow let me rest.
When I near the stream of death,
When I feel its chilly breath,
Rock where all my hopes abide,
In Thy shadow let me hide.

I have a Redeemer Who saves me from sin;
Now He’s abiding forever within,
His life for my ransom so freely He gave—
’Tis Jesus my Savior, mighty to save.
Mighty to save! He’s mighty to save,
Yes! Jesus my Savior is mighty to save!
Sin’s old allurements no longer I crave;
Jesus allures me, mighty to save.
I have a Redeemer to pilot me o’er
Life’s angry billows to Heaven’s fair shore;
I know He will keep me, tho’ wild be the wave—
’Tis Jesus my Savior, mighty to save.
I have a Redeemer, so watchful is He,
Walking beside me, my terrors all flee;
He guards me in danger, and bids me be brave—
’Tis Jesus my Savior, mighty to save.
I have a Redeemer, I know He is mine,
Proving His presence by power divine;
I surely can trust Him to conquer the grave—
This Jesus my Savior, mighty to save.

Joyful news to all mankind,
Jesus is mighty to save;
All who seek shall surely find
Jesus is mighty to save.
Sinners may relinquish wrong,
Faltering hearts may now be strong;
Sound the tidings right along,
Jesus is mighty, is mighty to save.
Jesus is mighty to save,
Jesus is mighty to save;
From the uttermost, to the uttermost,
Mighty to save!
Though as scarlet be the stains,
Jesus is mighty to save;
Though as steel the binding chains,
Jesus is mighty to save.
His the glorious sacrifice;
His the blood which paid the price;
His the love doth now entice;
Jesus is mighty, is mighty to save.
Fearful soul, discard thy fears,
Jesus is mighty to save;
Seeker, haste to dry thy tears,
Jesus is mighty to save.
With assurance seek His face,
Doubt no more His love and grace,
Give Him now His rightful place,
Jesus is mighty, is mighty to save.
Since His blood for thee was shed,
Jesus is mighty to save;
Since He lives Who once was dead,
Jesus is mighty to save.
While in conflict we engage,
When the storms around shall rage,
All our earthly pilgrimage,
Jesus is mighty, is mighty to save.

Mindful of our human frailty
Is the God in Whom we trust;
He Whose years are everlasting,
He remembers we are dust.
Man is like the tender flower,
And his days are like the grass,
Withered where it lately flourished
By the blighting winds that pass.
Changeless is Jehovah’s mercy
Unto those who fear His Name,
From eternity abiding
To eternity the same.
All the faithful to His covenant
Shall behold His righteousness;
He will be their strength and refuge
And their children’s children bless.

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
he hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;
his truth is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.
I have seen him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps
they have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
his day is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.
I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel;
"As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal";
let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,
since God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
he is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet;
our God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
with a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
as he died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;
while God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.
He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,
he is wisdom to the mighty, he is honor to the brave;
so the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong his slave,
our God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.

Thro’ scenes of joy or sorrow,
Jesus still is mine;
Thro’ ev’ry new tomorrow,
He will still be mine.
My Savior faileth never;
O how His glories shine,
I’ll sing it out forever,
He is mine, still mine.
Thro’ earthly tribulation,
Jesus still is mine;
My strength and consolation,
He is mine, still mine.
Tho’ lost, some fleeting treasure,
Jesus still is mine;
With love beyond all measure,
He is mine, still mine.
My Shepherd goes before me,
Jesus still is mine;
Beyond the vale, His glory!
He will still be mine.

I was kneeling by her bedside
And her life was almost gone
She was ready to see Jesus
Just didn't want to go alone
She was looking over Jordan
She could see the other shore
Knowing He would walk beside her
And He would keep her evermore
She had me sing of "Precious Memories"
And the "Old Rugged Cross"
And that when we cross the Jordan
We'll not have to cross alone
Oh how precious to our Savior
When His Saints are gathered home
She's just looking over Jordan
She's just looking toward her home
She's just looking over Jordan
She's just headed for her home

Gather 'round people listen to a song
About a missionary man from old San Juan
He love to sing and tell the story of Jesus
With his boat he sail cross Caribbean seas
Just a little man climbin' cocunut trees
He'd do anything to tell the story of Jesus
He's singin', "La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Do you know my Jesus?
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Will you come to meet Him?"
He's singin', "La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come and find rest in Him
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Everybody love Him"
Everybody love Him now man
Well, he carries his Bible everywhere, everyday
Even sailing across old San Juan Bay
Nothing can stop him when he's tellin' the story of Jesus
Well, he tells the good news all across the land
As he's praisin' the Lord to a samba band
And the people they stop to hear the story of Jesus
He's singin', "La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Do you know my Jesus? (He ask you, "Do you know Jesus, man?")
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Will you come to meet Him?" ("He invites you to His house, man, for a potluck.
Come meet Him")
He's singin', "La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come and find rest in Him ("He like a little man, He could even sleep in a
coconut tree")
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Everybody love Him ("Why, because He first love you")"
Jesus loves the man who travels on his way
To bring the good news and to sing His praise
With his whole heart does the best he can
Keepona' preachin' Missionary Man
He's singin', "La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Do you know my Jesus? (Do you know, do you know, do you know Him?)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Will you come to meet Him?" (Come and find rest in His love)
He's singin', "La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come and find rest in Him (Do you love, do you love, do you love Him)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Everybody love Him (Everybody love Him)"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Do you know my Jesus?"
Oh, Missionary Man
Come Missionary Man
Come and sing your song
Oh, Missionary Man
Oh, won't you come and sing
Oh, won't you come and sing your song, sing your song
All day long, oh Missionary Man

Mistful are our waiting eyes,
As of them who saw Him rise
From that mountain to the skies.
Then the holy angels near
Gave them tidings of good cheer:
“Jesus shall again appear."
And we wait an angel’s cry,
Piercing earthward from the sky:
“Now, behold your Lord is nigh!"
Yet, who shall abide that day,
When the Judge with dread array
Comes for universal sway?
Dreadly shall His summons sweep,
Heard by those who wake or sleep,
On the height or in the deep:
Heard by Life ’mid all its bloom,
Heard by Death in every tomb—
Terrible decree of doom.
For the gathered souls who stand,
Waiting that supreme command,
He shall part on either hand.
To those souls of quick and dead,
“Come," shall be the blessing said,
“Go," shall be the cursing dread.
Lord, dwell in us now, we pray,
That, in the dividing day,
We be not the cast away!
So shall we till Thou appear
Blend, in longing eye and ear,
Holy joy with holy fear!

Mixtures of joy and sorrow I daily do pass through,
Sometimes I'm in the valley--then sinking down with woe;
Sometimes I am exalted--on eagles' wings I fly;
Rising above Mount Pisgah, I almost reach the sky.
Sometimes my hope is little--I almost lay it by;
Sometimes it is sufficent if I were called to die;
Sometimes I am in doubting, and think I have no grace;
Sometimes I am a shouting and Bethel is the place.
Sometimes I shun the Christian, for fear he'll talk to me;
Sometimes he is the neighbor I long most to see;
Sometimes we meet together--in seasons dry and dull;
Sometimes I find a blessing of joy that fills my soul.
Sometimes I read my Bible--its seems a sealed book;
Sometimes I find a blessing whereever I do look.
Sometimes I got to meeting, and wise I'd staid at home;
Sometimes I find my Jesus, and then I'm glad I come.
O how I am thus tossed--thus tossed to and fro!
How are my hopes thus crossed wherever I do go!
O Lord, thou never changes--it is because I stray;
Lord, guide me by Spirit, and keep me in the way.

Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
Living with Jesus, a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment, I’m under His care.
Never a heartache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan;
Never a danger but there on the throne,
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus my Savior, abides with me still.

Here from the world we turn, Jesus to seek;
Here may His loving voice tenderly speak!
Jesus, our dearest Friend, while at Thy feet we bend,
O let Thy smile descend! ’Tis Thee we seek.
Come, holy Comforter, Presence divine,
Now in our longing hearts graciously shine;
O for Thy mighty power! O for a blessed shower,
Filling this hallowed hour with joy divine!
Savior, Thy work revive; here may we see
Those who are dead in sin quickened by Thee;
Come to our hearts tonight, make every burden light;
Cheer Thou our waiting sight; we long for Thee.

Won't buy you love 
Or happiness
Won't buy you love
Or happiness
(Money) Won't buy you love
(Money) Or happiness
(Money) Won't buy you love
(Money) Or happiness 
So many people that I know (they're strugglin')
So many places that I go (the same)
It's just another day
By any kind or way
They have got to get some of that mighty cold cash (gotta get mighty cold cash)
Now there are others who love to live it up
They spend in every way (every single way)
The only problem is
To keep this life of bliss
They have got to chase that dollar or it won't last (chase that dollar, or it won't last) 
Where do your priorities lie? (where do they lie)
Your wealth won't by (won't get you by)
True love's the key to life and happiness
There's better things to do
With what He's given you
Invest your time in God and not the 
Money 
Won't buy you happiness
You'll find that your success
It won't buy you love
Money
Won't buy you happiness
You'll find that your success
It won't buy you love 
Please don't misunderstand me (oh no please don't misunderstand me)
There's so much money can do (for you)
But it's so distracting
The problems attracting
Now when you let your money take ahold of you (let your money take ahold of you)
We spend like there will be no tomorrow (no tomorrow)
It happens everyday (every single day)
Success will only come
Once we have learned to trust
Leave it, let it 'lone, let God take full complete control (leave it, let it 
'lone, let God take full complete control) 
What (Hey) we are dealing with (Hey)
Is lack of faith in Him (Hey)
That he will supply our every need
Just wait on the Lord (Just wait on Him)
And what you're lookin' for
Will be there when you need it, know that 
There's a cancer in the nation, a disease of deprivation
It's the hunger for the power, it's a capitalist sensation
It disguises all the glitter, makes it look as fine as honey
But the way that you can spot it is a greedy taste for money 
Is it really, really all that you're about, is money?
Can you really, really ever do without the money?
If it's gonna be the reason for the strife, the money?
Gotta see that there is more to livin' life than money 
Don't get me wrong it's not the money or the power
Or the things that you acquire that oppose a man's salvation
But when you constantly pursue, it is now controlling you
You are headed for some trouble and temptation
Some people crave it, others use it, in the struggle they abuse it
They believe that with it they can buy their dreams
But they would quickly realize if they open up their eyes
Is that there's more to having money than it seems
It's just a dirty piece of paper, many colors, different labels
Some coins that you can barter and exchange
But if you let it, it can hurt you, it can make your friends desert you
'Cause you're values have been totally rearranged 
Is it really, really all that you're about, is money? (Is it really all that 
you're about?)
Can you really, really ever do without the money?
If it's gonna be the reason for the strife, the money? (Don't let it, don't let 
it be the reason)
Gotta see that there is more to livin' life than money 
(Money, money, money, 5,4,3,2,
Money! 

Your love is more than my mind can fathom
More than I know
Your love is more than the highest heavens
More than forever 
Before creation you knew my name
You formed my life in your hand
You breathed in me and I came to life
You heard my voice when I cried 
You put the touch in my fingertips
You put a song on my lips
You touched my eyes and I see the world
My ears to hear Your words 
Before you knew me, you loved me so
When I had no place to go
You came to me when my way was lost
Your love flowed from a cross 
You put warmth in a heart so cold
Made me a lamb in your fold
Gave me a purpose, a destiny
Lord you set me free 
Sometimes the future seems so unsure
Sometimes my heart is afraid
I draw my comfort from knowing you
Lord you are my friend 
More than my mind can fathom
More than I know
Your love is more than the highest heavens
More than forever
More 

More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love Who died for me.
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love Who died for me.
More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.
More about Jesus; in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.
More about Jesus; on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom’s sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

There’s a message that comes to the soul in its need,
’Tis a wonderful message, and all the world may read.
’Twas spoken for him whosoe’er will give it heed—
“I am come that they might have life, and more abundantly."
More abundantly, more abundantly,
That they might have life more abundantly;
they might have life, and more abundantly.
’Tis a message that tells of an infinite love,
That could bring One to earth from His throne of light above,
To save us from sin, and His wondrous grace to prove—
“I am come that they might have life, and more abundantly."
Tis a message of gladness the world cannot give,
And its fullness of meaning we freely may receive:
’Twas given for him who on Jesus will believe—
“I am come that they might have life, and more abundantly."

Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day
Didst make Thy triumph over death and sin,
And having harrowed hell, didst bring away
Captivity thence captive, us to win.
This joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin,
And grant that we may for whom Thou didest die,
Being with Thy dear blood clean washed from sin,
May live forever in felicity.
And that Thy love we weighing worthily,
May likewise love Thee for the same again;
And for Thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,
With love may one another entertain.
So let us love, dear Love, like as we ought;
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.

More holiness give me, more strivings within.
More patience in suffering, more sorrow for sin.
More faith in my Savior, more sense of His care.
More joy in His service, more purpose in prayer.
More gratitude give me, more trust in the Lord.
More zeal for His glory, more hope in His Word.
More tears for His sorrows, more pain at His grief.
More meekness in trial, more praise for relief.
More purity give me, more strength to o’ercome,
More freedom from earth-stains, more longings for home.
More fit for the kingdom, more useful I’d be,
More blessed and holy, more, Savior, like Thee.

More light shall break from out Thy Word
For pilgrim followers of the gleam,
Till, led by Thy free Spirit, Lord,
We see and share the pilgrim dream.
What mighty hopes are in our care,
What holy dreams of brotherhood;
God of our Fathers, help us dare
Their passion for the common good.
Wild roars the blast, the storm is high;
Above the storm are shining still
The lights by which we live and die;
Our peace is ever in Thy will.
The ancient stars, the ancient faith,
Defend us till our voyage is done;
Across the floods of fear and death
The Mayflower still is sailing on

More like Jesus would I be, let my Savior dwell with me;
Fill my soul with peace and love—make me gentle as a dove;
More like Jesus, while I go, pilgrim in this world below;
Poor in spirit would I be; let my Savior dwell in me.
If He hears the raven’s cry, if His ever watchful eye
Marks the sparrows when they fall, surely He will hear my call:
He will teach me how to live, all my sinful thoughts forgive;
Pure in heart I still would be—let my Savior dwell in me.
More like Jesus when I pray, more like Jesus day by day,
May I rest me by His side, where the tranquil waters glide.
Born of Him through grace renewed, by His love my will subdued,
Rich in faith I still would be—let my Savior dwell in me.

More like the Master I would ever be,
More of His meekness, more humility;
More zeal to labor, more courage to be true,
More consecration for work He bids me do.

More love
More power
More of You in my life.(2x)
I will worship You with all of my heart,
And I will worship You with all of my soul,
And I will worship You with all of my strength,
‘Cause You are my Lord, (echo)
You are my Lord.(echo)

More love to Thee, more love to Thee!

More than a friend, more than a friend
More than a friend, more than a friend
Well, he's more than a friend
More than a friend
Yes, he's more than a friend to me
'Cause he gave up his life
And at oh such a price
And he's more than a friend to me
People keep on searching for the perfect friend
Who they'll trust with their compassion and their confidence
Cause they need someone to love them in the deepest way
Hear what I'm about to say
He was willing to give his life
Ultimate sacrifice
He was God made flesh and put to death for me
Now you know it's easy to see
Ever since I've known him
I am not the same
And I'm proud to say that
I can wear his precious name
'Cause of all the ones who love me
That will ever be
No one cares as much as he
He was willing to count the cost
Suffering for the lost
Not a greater love that I could receive
Now you know I gotta believe
Listen to me
More than a friend
More than a friend (well he's more than a friend)
More than a friend
More than a friend (well he's more than a friend)
More than a friend
More than a friend (well he's more than a friend)
More than a friend
More than a friend

Through the cleansing blood of the dying Lamb,
Through the pow’r of grace and the precious Name,
Through the light that beams from the Morning Star,
More than conquerors, conquerors we are.
More than conquerors, more than conquerors,
Through the cleansing blood of the dying Lamb,
More than conquerors! more than conquerors,
Through the pow’r of grace and the precious Name.
Who shall sever us from the Savior’s love,
Or shall blot our names from Life’s book above?
Neither present things, nor the things to come,
Shall defeat our souls of the heav’nly home.
More than conquerors! There our Captain stands,
While our names are graven upon His hands;
Though the pow’rs of darkness against us frown,
We shall win the fight, and shall wear the crown.

need not trouble for the morrow,
For I am in my Father’s care;
He will go with me as I journey,
For all my need He will prepare.
I know that He provides the lilies,
His eye each falling sparrow sees;
And so my soul will fear no evil,
For I am more to Him than these.
I need not either thirst or hunger;
His grace will never be denied;
He leads me to the living waters;
His daily manna is supplied.
I need not an abiding city,
For “I can tarry but a night";
My heart, my treasure, are in Heaven,
My raiment is a robe of white.
O may my faith increase before Him,
My service here His blessing gain;
Let me seek first my Father’s kingdom,
For all beside must be in vain!

Morn of joy and morn of praise!
Brightest day of all the days,
For the Lord is risen, is risen!
Lo! they come at break of day,
Find the great stone rolled away;
Hark! and hear the angel say,
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Morn of gladness, morn of light!
Fear and gloom are put to flight,
For the Lord is risen, is risen!
Now no more the grave we fear,
For we know “He is not here";
But the angel speaks good cheer,
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.
O, what brightness from the Lord,
Shines within His blessed Word,
For the Lord is risen, is risen!
Telling of the world of light,
Where there is no death nor night,
Where, on Easter morning bright,
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.
Thither, too, O may we rise,
When this earthly body dies,
Where our Lord is risen, is risen!
Strive we, then, in each new day,
All that’s wrong to put away;
So shall we rejoicing say,
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.

Morn of morns, and day of days!
Beauteous were thy newborn rays:
Brighter yet from death’s dark prison
Christ, the Light of lights, is risen.
He commanded, and His Word
Death and the dread chaos heard;
Oh, shall we, more deaf than they,
In the chains of darkness stay?
Nature yet in shadow lies;
Let the sons of light arise,
And present the morning rays
With sweet canticles of praise.
While the dead world sleeps around,
Let the sacred temples sound
Law, and prophet, and blest psalm
Lit with holy light so calm.
Unto hearts in slumber weak
Let the heavenly trumpet speak;
And a newer walk express
Their new life to righteousness.
Grant us this, and with us be,
O Thou Fount of charity,
Thou Who dost the Spirit give,
Bidding the dead letter live.
Glory to the Father, Son,
And to Thee, O Holy One,
By Whose quickening breath divine
Our dull spirits turn and shine.

Morn's roseate hues have decked the sky;
The Lord has risen with victory:
Let earth be glad, and raise the cry,
Alleluia!
The Prince of Life with death has striv'n,
To cleanse the earth His blood has giv'n;
Has rent the veil, and opened Heav'n:
Alleluia!
And He, the wheat-corn, sown in earth,
Has giv'n a glorious harvest-birth,
Rejoice, and sing with holy mirth:
Alleluia!
And he, dear Lord, that with Thee dies,
And fleshly passions crucifies,
In body, like to Thine, shall rise:
Alleluia!
O grant us then, with Thee to die,
To spurn earth's fleeting vanity,
And love the things above the sky:
Alleluia!
Oh, praise the Father, and the Son,
Who has for us the triumph won,
And holy Ghost葉he Three in One:
Alleluia!

Now that the daystar glimmers bright
We suppliantly pray
That He, the uncreated Light,
May guide us on our way.
No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,
Nor thoughts that idly rove,
But simple truth be on our tongue,
And in our hearts be love.
And while the hours in order flow,
O Christ, securely fence
Our gates, beleaguered by the foe,
The gate of every sense.
And grant that to Thine honor, Lord,
Our daily toil may tend;
That we begin it at Thy Word,
And in Thy favor end.
To God the Father glory be,
And to His only Son,
And to the Spirit, One and Three,
While endless ages run.

Morning breaks upon the tomb;
Jesus scatters all its gloom.
Day of triumph through the skies;
See the glorious Savior rise.
Ye who are of death afraid
Triumph in the scattered shade.
Drive your anxious cares away;
See the place where Jesus lay.
Christians, dry your flowing tears
Chase your unbelieving fears;
Look on His deserted grave,
Doubt no more His power to save.

Morning has broken 
Like the first morning,
Black bird has spoken 
Like the first bird.
Praise the singing! 
Praise for the morning!
Praise for them springing 
Fresh from the Word! 
Sweet the rain's new fall 
Sunlit from heaven,
Like the first dewfall 
On the first grass.
Praise for the sweetness 
Of the wet garden,
Sprung in completeness 
Where His feet pass.
Mine is the sunlight! 
Mine is the morning.
Born of the one light 
Eden saw play!
Praise with elation, 
Praise ev'ry morning,
God's recreation 
Of the newday!

Thankful for the morning light,
Shining over earth and sea;
Thankful for the gift of sight
O Father, Lord, to Thee.
To Thee with all the heart I pray,
Now at the dawning of the day;
I know Thou hast me in Thy care,
And Thou wilt hear my prayer.
Thankful for the power to hear;
Thankful for the power to speak;
Lord, to Thee I bend my ear,
Thy holy face I seek,
To Thee my earliest thoughts are giv’n,
Like incense, may they rise to Heav’n;
And from Thee thence a blessing bear,
In answer to my prayer.
Thanks I give for strength and health,
Making all my pulses leap;
Greater boon than boundless wealth
Is waking out of sleep.
content and glad for each new day,
O father, Lord, to Thee I pray;
I pray to Heav’n for Thou art there;
And Thou art everywhere.
Greatest boon is heart of love;
May at length this heart be mine;
Lord, Thou sendest from above
Thy love and truth divine.
And they shall purge the willing soul
Of earthly ills, and make it whole;
For Thou didst come those ills to bear,
And canst not spurn my prayer.

The morning purples all the sky,
The air with praises rings,
Defeated hell stands sullen by,
The world exulting sings.
Glory to God! our glad lips cry;
All praise and worship be
On earth, in heaven, to God most high,
For Christ’s great victory,
For Christ’s great victory.
While He, the King all strong to save,
Rends the dark doors away,
And through the breaches of the grave,
Strides forth into the day.
Death’s captive, in his gloomy prison,
Fast fettered He has lain,
But He has mastered death, is risen,
And death now wears the chain.
The shining angels cry, “Away
With grief; no spices bring;
Not tears, but songs, this joyful day,
Should greet the rising King!"
That Thou our Paschal Lamb may’st be,
And endless joy begin.
Jesus, Deliverer, set us free
From the dread death of sin.

Morning red, morning red,
Now the shadows all are fled;
Now the Sabbath’s cloudless glory,
Tells anew the wondrous story,
Christ is risen from the dead.
All around, all around,
Solemn silence reigned profound;
When, with blaze and sudden thunder,
Angels burst the tomb asunder,
And the Savior was unbound.
Forth He came! Forth He came!
Robed in white, celestial flame!
Mary, at the empty prison,
Knew not her Redeemer risen
Till He called her by her name.
Morning red! Morning red!
Christ is risen from the dead!
Still He walketh in the garden,
Speaking words of love and pardon.
Though the crown is on His head.

Mortals, awake, with angels join,
And chant the solemn lay,
Joy, love, and gratitude combine,
To hail the auspicious day,
To hail the auspicious day.
In Heav’n the rapturous song began,
And sweet seraphic fire
Through all the shining legions ran,
And strung and tuned the lyre,
And strung and tuned the lyre.
Swift through the vast expanse it flew,
And loud the echo rolled,
The theme, the song, the joy, was new—
’Twas more than Heav’n could hold,
’Twas more than Heav’n could hold.
Down through the portals of the sky
The impetuous torrent ran;
And angels flew, with eager joy,
To bear the news to man,
To bear the news to man.
Hark! the cherubic armies shout,
And glory leads the song:
Good will and peace are heard throughout
The harmonious heav’nly throng,
The harmonious heav’nly throng.
With joy the we repeat,
“Glory to God on high!"
Good will and peace are now complete,
Jesus was born to die,
Jesus was born to die.
Hail, Prince of Life, forever hail!
Redeemer, Brother, Friend!
Though earth, and time, and life shall fail
Thy praise shall never end,
Thy praise shall never end.

Moses was a man of God (Moses, Moses)
Moses was a man of God (Moses, Moses)
He's walkin's side by side and in His will abide (Moses, Moses)
Moses was a man of God (Moses, Moses, Moses) 
Pharaoh's heart was hard against the Lord
He slaughtered Israel's baby boys
One was saved, saved from the heathen sword
Faith just couldn't be destroyed 
By God's design Moses lived his life
An the palace of the king (of the king)
It was a holy sign, he's the royal line
He is a servant of the King of Kings (servant of the King oh Savior) 
When Moses realized he was an Israelite
And found out Yahweh had a plan
He heard his people's cry, he surely knew their plight
He had to lead them to the promise land (to the land that He had promised His 
children) 
Through the Lord's inisitence, Moses showed resistance (Moses was afraid)
I guess he was afraid to go (you really know he didn't want to go)
But then his mind was made and no one could dissuade (he really made up his 
mind)
He had a power faithful God to show 
Man of God, his faith fires are burning
Man of God, has love ever yearning 
People wandered in the wilderness of sin
Their faith in God was really a mess (really was a mess)
But Moses's faith held true, he really pulled them through
A faithful man the word confessed 
It's true that in the end he did not enter in (did not, did not enter in)
He left the earth from Mt.Nebo 
A great example though of godly selfless love
And yes the Lord did love him so (He loved him, He loved him, He love him so)
Moses was a man of God (Moses, Moses, Moses)
Moses was a man of God (Moses, Moses, Moses) 

Most ancient of all mysteries,
before thy throne we lie;
have mercy now, most merciful, 
most holy Trinity.
When heaven and earth were yet unmade,
when time was yet unknown,
thou in thy bliss and majesty
didst live and love alone.
Thou wast not born; there was no fount
from which thy being flowed;
there is no end which thou canst reach:
but thou art simply God.
How wonderful creation is,
the work which thou didst bless!
And O what then must thou belike,
eternal Loveliness!
Most ancient of all mysteries,
low at thy throne we lie;
have mercy now, most merciful, 
most holy Trinity.

Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day
didst make thy triumph over death and sin,
and having harrowed hell, didst bring away
captivity thence captive, us to win:
this joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin,
and grant that we for whom thou diddest die,
being with thy dear Blood clean washed from sin,
may live for ever in felicity:
and that thy love we weighing worthily,
may likewise love thee for the same again;
and for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,
with love may one another entertain;
so let us love, dear Love, as we ought;
love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.
So let us love, dear Love, as we ought;
love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.

Most holy Lord and God of Heaven,
Who to the glowing sky hast given
The fires that in the east are born
With gradual splendors of the morn;
Who, on the fourth day, didst reveal
The sun’s enkindled flaming wheel,
Didst set the moon her ordered ways,
And stars their ever winding maze;
That each in its appointed way
Might separate night from day,
And of the seasons through the year
The well remembered signs declare;
Illuminate our hearts within,
And cleanse our minds from stain of sin;
Unburdened of our guilty load
May we unfettered serve our God.
O Father, that we ask be done,
Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.

Most perfect is the law of God,
Restoring those that stray;
His testimony is most sure,
Proclaiming wisdom’s way.
O how I love Thy law!
O how I love Thy law!
It is my meditation all the day.
O how I love Thy law!
O how I love Thy law!
It is my meditation all the day.
The precepts of the Lord are right;
With joy they fill the heart;
The Lord’s commandments all are pure,
And clearest light impart.
The fear of God is undefiled
And ever shall endure;
The statutes of the Lord are truth
And righteousness most pure.
They warn from ways of wickedness
Displeasing to the Lord,
And in the keeping of His Word
There is a great reward.

Mary, hear my fervent prayer.
Take me 'neath thy care;
O Mother loved, be my life, my stay,
Guide and love me, save and protect me,
'Till the dawn of eternal day
Mary, hear my fervent prayer,
Take me 'neath thy care;
O mother loved, be my life, my stay.
O Mother loved, watch over me,
So helpless, tossed on life's rough sea;
Kindly shed from heaven above
A Mother's sweet fond smile of love.
O Mother loved, watch over me,
From sin and danger keep me free;
When temptation's waves angry flow,
Thyself to me a mother show.
O Mother loved, watch over me,
When life is bright and fair to see;
Who so need thy clear guiding ray
As those that walk the flow'ry way.

Sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child 
Sometimes I wish I could fly,
Like a bird up in the sky 
Sometimes I wish I could fly,
Like a bird in the sky
Little closer to home 
Motherless children
Have a real hard time 
Motherless children
Have a such a real hard time
So long so long so long 
Sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child 
Sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child
So far away 
Sometimes I feel
Like freedom is near 
Sometimes I feel
Like freedom is near
But we're so far away 
Sometimes I feel
Like it's close at hand 
Sometimes I feel
Like the freedom is near
But we're so far from home 
Sometimes, sometimes, |
Sometimes
So far, so far, so far, 
So far Mama from you, so far 

I love to sing and I love to pray
I worship the Lord most every day
I go to the temple and I just want to stay
To hide from the hustle of the world and its ways
I love to live on a mountain top
And be fellowshipping with the Lord
Love to stand on a mountain top
Because I love to feel my spirit soar
But I must come down from that mountain top
To the people in the valley below
They'll never know that they can go
To the mountain of the Lord
They can go to the mountain yeah.
Praising the Father is a good thing to do
I worship the trinity in spirit and truth
But if we worship all of the time
There would be no one to lead the blind
Well I am not saying that worship is wrong
Worship is more than just singing a song
It's all that you say and everything that do
It's letting His spirit live in you
They can go to the mountain of the Lord
They can go yeah
They can go (they can go to the mountain)
They can go yeah
They can go (go to the mountain)
They can go, they can go to the mountain (fade)

Mourn for the thousands slain,
The youthful and the strong;
Mourn for the wine cup’s fearful reign,
And the deluded throng.
Mourn for the ruined soul—
Eternal life and light,
Lost by the fiery, maddening bowl,
And turned to hopeless night.
Mourn for the lost; but call,
Call to the strong, the free;
Rouse them to shun that dreadful fall,
And to the refuge flee.
Mourn for the lost; but pray,
Pray to our God above,
To break the fell destroyer’s sway,
And show His saving love.

Let the whole wide world be taken,
In the name of Christ our King;
Let the powers of sin be shaken,
And our shouts of victory ring;
Jesus calls, why should we tarry?
Let our loyal hearts respond,
And the fight of faith we’ll carry
To the regions still beyond.
Move forward into battle!
Let this our watchword be;
With Christ, our mighty Captain,
We’ll gain the victory;
He leads us to the battle,
The King Whom we adore;
We’ll fight till He shall conquer all,
And reign from shore to shore.
Onward with the Gospel story,
Let the Word of Life prevail
Over evils grim and hoary;
Never shall our Leader fail;
He it is Who goes before us,
’Tis His banner floats on high;
Lift again the joyful ,
Hail the triumph drawing nigh.
Take the armor of salvation,
Battling on the fields afar;
Giant ills, in every nation,
Fall before the Morning Star;
“Go ye," hear the Master saying,
With His ever conquering sword;
Help us, Lord, Thy Word obeying,
Faith shall gain a rich reward.

Well you can lean on each other
You've got faith in the Lord, the Lord, the Lord 
Hey all of you standing next to the pew
Come and let's have us a sit
We're praising the Lord, the one we adore
We might not be able to quit
We're teaching and sharing, we're laughing and caring
The brothers and sisters are near
So move over Satan, you're the one that we're hatin'
There ain't no room for you here 
Move over, move over
Satan ain't no room for you here (you here)
Move over, move over
Satan you get right out of here
You ain't got a chance, with the saints you can't dance
In the name of Jehovah for you it's all over
Move over, move over, move over, move over 
The boys in the 'hood are doing some good
Spreading His Word all around
We're doing some singing, his Word we're bringing
Though a sweet a cappella sound
Kicking and screaming, we're dissin' the demon
We're really singing him down
So, Satan goodbye, we're telling you why
The boys are back in town 
Well you can lean on each other
You've got faith in the Lord, the Lord, the Lord
Move over 

I've, I've got something to tell that old
Low down, back slidin', joy robbin' demonic disgrace
I'm gonna tell Him to move on outta my face
Move Satan, move on out of my way
Move Satan, move on out of my way
I said get ye behind me Satan, move on out of my way
Move on out of my way (move, move, move) so I can pray
Old man Joel, he was a prayin' man (look now, hallelujah, look now, hallelujah)
He became afflicted, oppressed by Satan's hand (look now, hallelujah, look now, 
hallelujah)
He tried Joel, destroyed his children, too (look now, hallelujah, look now, 
hallelujah)
If you have faith in Him, he'll make a way for you (look now, hallelujah, look 
now, hallelujah)
Now when you're discouraged, when your friends are through
When you're in trouble, don't know what to do
Call on Jesus, anytime, anywhere
He will bear your burden, He will be right there
Move Satan, move on out of my way
Move Satan, move on out of my way
I said get ye behind me Satan, move on out of my way
Move on out of my way (move, move, move)
Nobody can stop me, you better keep movin' (move on out of my way, move on out 
of my way))
I'm gonna make you get on out of my face (move on out of my way)
You know you better get on out of my way (move on out of my way)
I'm talking to you, so that I can pray

I love to think about a paradise (I love to think about a paradise)
Somewhere beyond the blue (Somewhere beyond the blue)
A mansion waiting in the distant skies (A mansion waiting in the distant skies)
Maybe next door to you (Maybe next door to you)
We'll go parading through the distant stars (We'll go parading through the 
distant stars)
Right down the Milky Way (Right down the Milky Way)
The planets Jupiter, Neptune, and Mars (The planets Jupiter and Neptune and 
Mars)
Won't even be halfway (Won't even be halfway)
Oh yes I'm moving, moving, moving, moving
Moving up to gloryland
Oh yes I'm moving, moving, moving, moving
Holding to His nail-scarred hands
Don't know when I'm leaving but I'm ready to go
When I get to heaven I'll be welcome I know
Oh yes I'm moving, moving, moving, moving
Moving up to gloryland
I made my reservation long ago (I made my reservation long ago)
The day I gave up sin (The day I gave up sin)
And when my mansions ready this I know (And when my mansions ready this I know)
I'm gonna move right in (I'm gonna move right in)
I have a vision of a happy place (I have a vision of a happy place)
Where friends and loved ones meet (Where friends and loved ones meet)
Right on the corner of God's avenue (Right on the corner of God's avenue)
And hallelujah street (And hallelujah street)

The evergreen branches are waving around us,
And sweetly our carols in harmony ring,
While here we are gathered to welcome with rapture
The birth of our Savior, Redeemer, and King.
Hark! the music of the angels
Floating onward still we hear;
Blessed music, sweetest 
Ever sung to mortal ear.
How graciously favored the shepherds of Judah,
Who guarded their flocks on that wonderful morn,
When legions descended, proclaiming the tidings
That Jesus, the promised Redeemer, was born.
How humble His birthplace, how lowly His cradle,
O tender compassion, O infinite love!
The Son of the Highest our nature assuming
That we might inherit the mansions above.
The sweet chiming bells with our carols are blending,
A glad, merry Christmas they joyfully ring.
While here we are gathered to welcome with rapture
The birth of our Savior, Redeemer, and King.

Music I love—­but ne’er a strain
Could kindle raptures so divine,
So grief assuage, so conquer pain,
And rouse this pensive heart of mine;
As that we hear on Christmas morn,
Upon the wintry breezes borne.
Though darkness still her empire keep,
And hours must pass, ere morning break;
From troubled dreams, or slumbers deep,
That music kindly bids us wake:
It calls us, with an angel’s voice,
To wake, and worship, and rejoice.
To greet with joy the glorious morn,
Which angels welcomed long ago,
When our redeeming Lord was born,
To bring the light of Heaven below;
The powers of darkness to dispel,
And rescue Earth from death and hell.
While listening to that sacred strain,
My raptured spirit soars on high;
I seem to hear those songs again
Resounding through the open sky,
That kindled such divine delight,
In those who watched their flocks by night.
With them, I celebrate His birth;
Glory to God, in highest Heaven,
Good will to men, and peace on Earth,
To us a Savior King is given;
Our God is come to claim His own,
And Satan’s power is overthrown!
A sinless God, for sinful men,
Descends to suffer and to bleed;
Hell must renounce its empire then;
The price is paid, the world is freed,
And Satan’s self must now confess,
That Christ has earned a right to bless.
Now holy peace may smile from Heaven,
And heavenly truth from earth shall spring:
The captive’s galling bonds are riven,
For our Redeemer is our King;
And He that gave His blood for men
Will lead us home to God again.

Must friends and kindred droop and die?
And helpers be withdrawn?
While sorrow with a weeping eye
Counts up our comforts gone?
Be thou our comfort, mighty God!
Our helper and our friend;
Nor leave us in this dang'rous road
Till all our trails end.
O, may our feet pursue the way
Our pious fathers led!
With love and holy zeal obey
The counsels of the dead.
Let us be weaned from all below,
Let hope our grief expel,
While death invites our soul to go
Where our best kindred dwell.

“Must I go, and empty handed,"
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?
“Must I go, and empty handed?"
Must I meet my Savior so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him,
Must I empty handed go?
Not at death I shrink or falter,
For my Savior saves me now;
But to meet Him empty handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.
O the years in sinning wasted,
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Savior,
To His will I’d gladly bow.
O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,
Up and work while yet ’tis day;
Ere the night of death o’ertake thee,
Strived for souls while still you may.

Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for everyone,
And there’s a cross for me.
How happy are the saints above,
Who once went sorrowing here!
But now they taste unmingled love,
And joy without a tear.
The consecrated cross I’ll bear
Till death shall set me free;
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there’s a crown for me.
Upon the crystal pavement down
At Jesus’ pierced feet,
Joyful I’ll cast my golden crown
And His dear Name repeat.
O precious cross! O glorious crown!
O resurrection day!
When Christ the Lord from Heav’n comes down
And bears my soul away.

I am far frae my hame, an’ I’m weary aftenwhiles,
For the langed for hame bringin’, an’ my Father’s welcome smiles;
An’ I’ll ne’er be fu’ content, until mine een do see
The gowden gates o’ Heav’n an’ my ain countrie.
The earth is fleck’d wi’ flowers, mony tinted, fresh an’ gay
The birdies warble blithely, for my Faither made them sae:
But these sights an’ these soun’s will as naething be to me,
When I hear the angels singin’ in my ain countrie.
I’ve His gude word o’ promise that some gladsome day, the King
To His ain royal palace his banished hame will bring;
Wi’een an’ wi’ hert rinnin’ owre, we shall see
The King in His beauty, in oor ain countrie.
Sae little noo I ken, o’ yon blessed, bonnie place
I only ken it’s Hame, whaur we shall see His face,
It wad surely be eneuch for ever mair to be
In the glory o’ His presence, in oor ain countrie.
He is faithfu’ that hath promised, an He’ll surely come again,
He’ll keep His tryst wi’ me, at what oor I dinnna ken;
But He bids me still to wait, an’ ready aye to be,
To gang at ony moment to my ain countrie.

Though the angry surges roll
On my tempest driven soul,
I am peaceful, for I know,
Wildly though the winds may blow,
I’ve an anchor safe and sure,
That can evermore endure.
And it holds, my anchor holds:
Blow your wildest, then, O gale,
On my bark so small and frail;
By His grace I shall not fail,
For my anchor holds, my anchor holds.
Mighty tides about me sweep,
Perils lurk within the deep,
Angry clouds o’ershade the sky,
And the tempest rises high;
Still I stand the tempest’s shock,
For my anchor grips the rock.
I can feel the anchor fast
As I meet each sudden blast,
And the cable, though unseen,
Bears the heavy strain between;
Through the storm I safely ride,
Till the turning of the tide.
Troubles almost ’whelm the soul;
Griefs like billows o’er me roll;
Tempters seek to lure astray;
Storms obscure the light of day:
But in Christ I can be bold,
I’ve an anchor that shall hold.

My blessed Savior, is Thy Love
So great, so full, so free?
Behold, I give my love, my heart,
My life, my all to Thee.
I love Thee for the glorious worth
In Thy great self I see:
I love Thee for that shameful cross
Thou hast endured for me.
No man of greater love can boast
Than for his friend to die:
But for Thy enemies Thou wast slain:
What love with Thine can vie!
O Lord, I’ll cherish in my soul
The memory of Thy love:
And Thy dear Name shall still to me
A priceless treasure prove.

My country, ’tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the pilgrims’ pride,
From every mountainside,
Let freedom ring!
My native country, thee,
Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love;
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above.
Let music swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees,
Sweet freedom’s song;
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence break,
The sound prolong.
Our fathers’ God, to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright
With freedom’s holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King.

My days are gliding swiftly by;
And I, a pilgrim stranger,
Would not detain them as they fly,
Those hours of toil and labor.
For, oh! we stand on Jordan’s strand;
Our friends are passing over;
And, just before, the shining shore
We may almost discover.
We’ll gird our loins, my brethren dear,
Our distant home discerning:
Our waiting Lord has left us word,
Let ev’ry lamp be burning.
Should coming days be cold and dark,
We need not cease our singing:
That perfect rest naught can molest,
Where golden harps are ringing.
Let sorrow’s rudest tempest blow,
Each cord on earth to sever:
Our King says, “Come," and there’s our home,
Forever, oh! forever.

My dear Redeemer and my Lord,
I read my duty in thy word;
But in thy life the law appears,
Drawn out in living characters.
Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal,
Such def'rence to thy Father's will,
Such love, and meekness so divine,
I would transcribe, and make them mine.
Cold mountains and the midnight air
Witness the fervor of thy prayer;
The desert thy temptations knew,
Thy conflict and thy vict'ry too.
Be thou my pattern; make me bear
More of thy gracious image here;
Then God, the Judge, shall own my name,
Among the foll'wers of the Lamb.

My dearest, lovely, native land,
Where peace and pleasure grow,
Where joy with fairest, softest hand,
Wipes off the tears of woe—
Thy Sabbaths, laws, and happy shores,
And names, I love them well,
And looking o’er those richest stores,
How can I say, Farewell!
O sacred home, how sweet thou art,
And all thy scenes how dear!
Thou dost with chords entwine my heart,
And seem’st to say, “Stay here!"
Thou always didst an angel prove,
My youthful fears to quell,
Thou still art clad with smiles of love,
And can I say, Farewell!
My parents, brothers, sisters, friends
My warm affection know,
And love from each my path attends,
And can I from them go?
The thoughts of days that now are past,
No pen or tongue can tell;
Though to my heart they cling so fast,
Yet I must say, Farewell!
No sighs of grief my bosom heave,
No tears of anguish roll:
My friends, my all, I gladly leave,
For Jesus cheers my soul.
Ye winds, then waft me far away,
The tale of love to tell;
To country, home, and friends I say,
Farewell, O! yes, Farewell!

My faith has found a resting place,
Not in device or creed;
I trust the ever living One,
His wounds for me shall plead.
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea,
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.
Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
He’ll never cast me out.
My heart is leaning on the Word,
The living Word of God,
Salvation by my Savior’s Name,
Salvation through His blood.
My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.

My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary, Savior divine!
Now hear me while I pray, take all my guilt away,
O let me from this day be wholly Thine!
May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire!
As Thou hast died for me, O may my love to Thee,
Pure warm, and changeless be, a living fire!
While life’s dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread, be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day, wipe sorrow’s tears away,
Nor let me ever stray from Thee aside.
When ends life’s transient dream,
When death’s cold sullen stream over me roll;
Blest Savior, then in love, fear and distrust remove;
O bear me safe above, a ransomed soul!

I thought I had
To see and feel
To prove that what I loved
Was really real
But passion turned to ashes
Things I held to dust 
I found reality in simple trust
()
My faith still holds onto the Christ of Calvary
Oh blessed Rock of Ages cleft for me
I gladly place my trust in things I cannot see
My faith still holds onto the Christ of Calvary
And oh what joy
To walk this way
I’ve followed nail pierced footprints all the way
And though the end of where I’m bound
I may not see
I choose to place my trust in Calvary

My faith, it is an oaken staff,
The traveler’s well loved aid;
My faith, it is a weapon stout,
The soldier’s trusty blade,
I’ll travel on, and still be stirred,
By silent thought or social word;
By all my perils undeterred,
A soldier pilgrim staid.
I have a Guide, and in His steps
When travelers have trod,
Whether beneath was flinty rock
Or yielding grassy sod,
They cared not, with force unspent,
Unmoved by pain, they onward went,
Unstayed by pleasures, still they bent
Their zealous course to God.
My faith, it is an oaken staff,
O let me on it lean!
My faith, it is a trusty sword,
May falsehood find it keen!
Thy Spirit, Lord, to me impart,
O make me what Thou ever art,
Of patient and courageous heart,
As all true saints have been.

My faith temptation shall not move,
For Jesus knows it all,
And holds me with His arm of love—
He will not let me fall.
He will not let me fall,
He will not let me fall,
He is my Strength, my Hope, my All,
He will not let me fall.
When grief is more than I can bear—
To weak am I to call—
If I but lift my heart in prayer,
He will not let me fall.
Sometimes I falter, filled with fear,
I cannot see at all,
His voice I never fail to hear—
“I will not let thee fall."

My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.
I’m a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I’m a child of the King.
My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
That we may be His when He comes by and by.
I once was an outcast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.
A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They’re building a palace for me over there;
Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.

I know my heav'nly Father knows
The storms that would my way oppose;
But He can drive the clouds away,
And turn the darkness into day.
I know my heav'nly Father knows
The balm I need to soothe my woes;
And with His touch of love divine
He heals this wounded heart of mine.
I know my heav'nly Father knows
How frail I am to meet my foes;
But He my cause will e弾r defend,
Uphold and keep me to the end.
I know my heav'nly Father knows
The hour my journey here will close;
And may that hour, O faithful Guide,
Find me safe sheltered by Thy side.

My Father, for another night
Of quiet sleep and rest,
For all the joy of morning light,
Thy holy Name be blest.
Now with the newborn day I give
Myself anew to Thee,
That as Thou willest I may live,
And what Thou willest be.
Whate’er I do, things great or small,
Whate’er I speak or frame,
Thy glory may I seek in all,
Do all in Jesus’ Name.
My Father, for His sake, I pray
Thy child accept and bless;
And lead me by Thy grace today
In paths of righteousness.

My Father, hear my prayer
Before I go to rest;
It is Thy trustful child
That cometh to be blest.
Forgive me all my sin,
And let me sleep this night
In safety and in peace
Until the morning light.
Lord, help me every day
To love Thee more and more,
And try to do Thy will
Much better than before.
Now look upon me, Lord,
Ere I lie down to rest;
It is Thy trustful child
That cometh to be blest.

Sailing down behind the sun
Waiting for my prince to come
Praying for the healing rain
To restore my soul again
Just a poor man on the run
How did I get here?
What have I done?
When will all my hopes arise?
How will I know him?
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes) My father's eyes (yeah)
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes) My father's eyes (yeah)
Then the light begins to shine (shine)
I hear those ancient lullabies
And as I watched this seedling grow
Feel my heart start to overflow
Where do I find the words to say?
How do I teach him?
What do we play?
Bit by bit, I've realized
That's when I need them
That's when I need my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes) My father's eyes (yeah) (that's when I need them)
(That's when I need my father's eyes) I look into my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes) My father's eyes (yeah)
When the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears
I'm like a bridge that was washed away
My foundations were made of clay
And as my soul slides down to die
How could I lose him?
What did I try?
Bit by bit, I've realized
That He was here with me
I looked into my Father's eyes
I look into my Father's eyes
I look into my Father's eyes

I have a future all sublime,
Beyond the realms of space and time,
Where my Redeemer I shall see,
And sorrow nevermore shall be.
A precious heritage is mine;
’Tis kept above by love divine;
And while I tarry here below,
He gives me what is best, I know.
O, God be praised, He planned for me;
From anxious care I’m spared and free;
He bids me cast on Him my care—
What then remains for me to bear?
Sweet peace within my soul doth dwell;
With joy I sing: “Now all is well,"
He leads me safely by His hand
Until I reach the Glory Land.
O precious Savior, teach Thou me
To live my life more true to Thee
The little while I yet must roam
Before I reach my heav’nly home

His hand alone can lift us higher than we deserve
His heart alone can love us like no other love
He carries me and gives me everything
(My God) He helps me to see
My God, my God, my God is living
My God, my God, my God, He's able
My God, my God, my God, you know my God (is God) is God
His arms alone can reach to my every need
His strength alone can rescue me
He watches over me and hears my every need
(My God) He sets me free
My God, my God, my God is living
My God, my God, my God is able to do so much more than we can imagine
By His power in me (and by His power in me)
By His power in me
My God, my God, my God is living
My God, my God, my God is able
My God, my God, my God you know my God is (is my God), is living (my God), is 
able (my God)
My God is God

My God, accept my heart this day,
And make it always Thine,
That I from Thee no more may stray,
No more from Thee decline.
Before the cross of Him Who died,
Behold, I prostrate fall;
Let every sin be crucified,
Let Christ be all in all.
Anoint me with Thy heavenly grace,
Adopt me for Thine own,
That I may see Thy glorious face,
And worship at Thy throne.
May the dear blood once shed for me
My blest atonement prove
That I from first to last may be
The purchase of Thy love!
Let every thought, and work, and word,
To Thee be ever given;
Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,
And death the gate of Heaven.

My God and Father! while I stray
Far from my home in life’s rough way,
Oh! teach me from my heart to say,
“Thy will be done!"
Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
Let me “be still," and murmur not,
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
“Thy will be done!"
What though in lonely grief I sigh,
For friends beloved, no longer nigh,
Submissive still would I reply,
“Thy will be done!"
If Thou shouldst call me to resign
What most I prize, it ne’er was mine;
I only yield Thee what was Thine;
“Thy will be done!"
Should pining sickness waste away,
My life in premature decay,
My Father! still I strive to say,
“Thy will be done!"
If but my fainting heart be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit for its guest,
My God! to Thee I leave the rest--
“Thy will be done!"
Renew my will from day to day,
Blend it with Thine, and take away
All now that makes it hard to say,
“Thy will be done!"
Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before,
I’ll sing upon a happier shore,
“Thy will be done!"

My God and I go in the field together
We walk and talk as good friends should and do
We clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter
My God and I walk through the meadow’s hue
We clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter
My God and I walk through the meadow’s hue
He tells me of the years that went before me
When heavenly plans were made for me to be
When all was but a dream of dim reflection
To come to life, earth's verdant glory see
When all was but a dream of dim reflection
To come to life, earth's verdant glory see
My God and I will go for aye together
We'll walk and talk just as good friends do
This earth will pass, and with it common trifles
But God and I will go unendingly
This earth will pass, and with it common trifles
But God and I will go unendingly
Spoken Vocal:
I will lift mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help.My help cometh 
from the Lord.Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my 
life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

My God, and is Thy table spread,
And does Thy cup with love o’erflow?
Thither be all Thy children led,
And let them all its sweetness know.
Hail, sacred feast, which Jesus makes,
Rich banquet of His flesh and blood!
Thrice happy he who here partakes
That sacred stream, that heav’nly food!
Why are its bounties all in vain
Before unwilling hearts displayed?
Was not for the Victim slain?
Are we forbid the children’s bread?
O let Thy table honored be,
And furnished well with joyful guests;
And may each soul salvation see,
That here its sacred pledges tastes!
Let crowds approach, with hearts prepared;
With warm desire let all attend;
Nor, when we leave our Father’s board,
The pleasures or the profit end.

My God, consider my distress,
Let mercy plead my cause;
Though I have sinned against Thy grace,
I can’t forget Thy laws.
Forbid, forbid the sharp reproach
Which I so justly fear;
Uphold my life, uphold my hopes,
Nor let my shame appear.
Be Thou a surety, Lord, for me,
Nor let the proud oppress;
But make Thy waiting servant see
The shinings of Thy face.
My eyes with expectation fail,
My heart within me cries,
“When will the Lord His truth fulfill,
And make my comforts rise?"
Look down upon my sorrows, Lord,
And show Thy grace the same
As Thou art ever wont t’afford
To those that love Thy Name.

My God, how endless is Thy love!
Thy gifts are every evening new;
And morning mercies from above
Gently distill like early dew.
Thou spread’st the curtains of the night,
Great Guardian of my sleeping hours;
Thy sovereign Word restores the light,
And quickens all my drowsy powers.
I yield my powers to Thy command,
To Thee I consecrate my days;
Perpetual blessings from Thine hand
Demand perpetual songs of praise.

My God, how many are my fears!
How fast my foes increase!
Conspiring my eternal death,
They break my present peace.
The lying tempter would persuade
There’s no relief in Heav’n;
And all my swelling sins appear
Too big to be forgiv’n.
But Thou, my glory and my strength,
Shalt on the tempter tread,
Shalt silence all my threatening guilt,
And raise my drooping head.
I cried, and from His holy hill
He bowed a listening ear;
I called my Father, and my God,
And He subdued my fear.
He shed soft slumbers on mine eyes,
In spite of all my foes;
I woke, and wondered at the grace
That guarded my repose.
What though the hosts of death and hell
All armed against me stood,
Terrors no more shall shake my soul;
My refuge is my God.
Arise, O Lord, fulfill Thy grace,
While I Thy glory sing;
My God has broke the serpent’s teeth,
And death has lost his sting.
Salvation to the Lord belongs;
His arm alone can save;
Blessings attend Thy people here,
And reach beyond the grave.

My God! how perfect are Thy ways!
But mine polluted are;
Sin twines itself about my praise,
And slides into my prayer.
When I would speak what Thou hast done
To save me from my sin;
I cannot make Thy mercies known
But self-applause creeps in.
Divine desire, that holy flame
Thy grace creates in me;
Alas! impatience is its name,
When it returns to Thee.
This heart, a fountain of vile thoughts,
How does it overflow?
While self upon the surface floats
Still bubbling from below.
Let others in the gaudy dress
Of fancied merit shine;
The Lord shall be my righteousness
The Lord for ever mine.

My God, how wonderful Thou art,
Thy majesty, how bright;
How beautiful Thy mercy seat
In depths of burning light!
How dread are Thy eternal years,
O everlasting Lord,
By prostrate spirits day and night
Incessantly adored!
How wonderful, how beautiful,
The sight of Thee must be;
Thy endless wisdom, boundless power,
And glorious purity!
O how I fear Thee, living God,
With deep and tender fear;
And worship Thee with trembling hope,
And penitential tears!
Yet, I may love Thee, too, O Lord,
Almighty as Thou art;
For Thou hast stooped to ask of me
The love of my poor heart!
No earthly father loves like Thee,
No mother, e’er so mild,
Bears and forbears as Thou hast done,
With me, Thy sinful child.
Father of Jesus, love’s Reward!
What rapture it will be
Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,
And gaze, and gaze on Thee!

My God, I am thine;
What a comfort divine,
What a blessing to know that my Jesus is mine!
In the heavenly Lamb
Thrice happy I am,
And my heart it doth dance at the sound of his name.
True pleasures abound
In the rapturous sound;
And whoever hath found it hath paradise found.
My Jesus to know,
As rejoicing I go
To my life everlasting, 'tis heaven below.
Yet onward I haste
To the heavenly feast:
That, that is the fullness; but this is the taste;
And this I shall prove,
Till with joy I remove
To the heaven of heavens in Jesus's love.

My God! I know, I feel Thee mine,
And will not quit my claim,
Till all I have is lost in Thine,
And all renewed I am.
I hold Thee with a trembling hand,
But will not let Thee go,
Till steadfastly by faith I stand,
And all Thy goodness know.
When shall I see the welcome hour,
That plants my God in me!
Spirit of health, and life, and power,
And perfect liberty!
Jesus, Thine all victorious love
Shed in my heart abroad;
Then shall my feet no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God.
Love only can the conquest win,
The strength of sin subdue,
(My own unconquerable sin)
And form my soul anew.
Love can bow down the stubborn neck,
The stone to flesh convert,
Soften, and melt, and pierce, and break
An adamantine heart.
O that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow,
Burn up the dross of base desire,
And make the mountains flow!
O that it now from heaven might fall,
And all my sins consume!
Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,
Spirit of burning, come!
Refining fire, go through my heart,
Illuminate my soul;
Scatter Thy life through every part,
And sanctify the whole.
No longer then my heart shall mourn,
While, purified by grace,
I only for His glory burn,
And always see His face.
My steadfast soul, from falling free,
Shall then no longer move;
But Christ be all the world to me,
And all my heart be love.

My God, I love Thee; not because
I hope for heaven thereby,
Nor yet because who love Thee not
May eternally die.
Thou, O my Jesus, Thou didst me
Upon the cross embrace;
For me didst bear the nails and spear,
And manifold disgrace.
And griefs and torments numberless,
And sweat of agony;
E’en death itself; and all for man
Who was Thine enemy.
Then why, O blessed Jesus Christ
Should I not love Thee well?
Not for the hope of winning heaven,
Nor of escaping hell.
Not with the hope of gaining aught,
Nor seeking a reward,
But as Thyself hast loved me,
O everlasting Lord!
E’en so I love Thee, and will love,
And in Thy praise will sing,
Solely because Thou art my God,
And my eternal King.

My God, I thank Thee, Who hast made
The earth so bright,
So full of splendor and of joy,
Beauty and light;
So many glorious things are here,
Noble and right.
I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made
Joy to abound;
So many gentle thoughts and deeds
Circling us round,
That in the darkest spot of earth
Some love is found.
I thank Thee more that all our joy
Is touched with pain,
That shadows fall on brightest hours,
That thorns remain;
So that earth’s bliss may be our guide,
And not our chain.
For thou who knowest, Lord, how soon
Our weak heart clings,
Hast given us joys, tender and true,
Yet all with wings;
So that we see gleaming on high
Diviner things.
I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept
The best in store;
We have enough, yet not too much
To long for more:
A yearning for a deeper peace
Not known before.
I thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls
Though amply blessed,
Can never find, although they seek
A perfect rest;
Nor ever shall, until they lean
On Jesus’ breast.

My God, in Whom are all the springs
Of boundless love, and grace unknown,
Hide me beneath Thy spreading wings,
Till the dark cloud is overblown.
Up to the heav’ns I send my cry,
The Lord will my desires perform;
He sends His angel from the sky,
And saves me from the threat’ning storm.
Be Thou exalted, O my God,
Above the heav’ns, where angels dwell;
Thy power on earth be known abroad,
And land to land Thy wonders tell.
My heart is fixed; my song shall raise
Immortal honors to Thy Name;
Awake, my tongue, to sound His praise,
My tongue, the glory of my frame.
High o’er the earth His mercy reigns,
And reaches to the utmost sky;
His truth to endless years remains,
When lower worlds dissolve and die.

If you dwell beneath the shelter
Of the Lord your God Most High,
You will rest within the shadow of Almighty El Shaddai.
He’ll deliver you from all your foes
As you let loose the cry, “My God, in Whom I trust!"
He’s my Refuge and my Fortress,
My Salvation and my Stronghold,
He’s my Rock and my Deliverer,
My God, in Whom I trust!
He will cover you with feathers,
Give you refuge ’neath his wings.
You will have no fear of terror by night
Or what the daylight brings.
His own faithfulness will be your shield because your spirit sings,
“My God, in Whom I trust!"
Though a thousand at your left may fall,
Ten thousand at your right,
The disaster won’t come near your tent,
But only pass your sight.
If you make the Lord your dwelling place,
He’ll save you from your plight, this God, in whom you trust!
He’ll command his angel hosts on high
To guard you in your way.
They will lift you up in mighty hands,
So you’ll not trip or stray.
You will trample down the lion and the serpent while you say,
“My God, in Whom I trust!"
It’s because you love the Lord your God
That he protects your frame.
He has promised to deliver all who call upon his name.
He will show you his salvation,
For your word is e’er the same,
“My God, in Whom I trust!"

My God, is any hour so sweet
From blush of morn to evening star,
As that which calls me to Thy feet—
The hour of prayer?
Blest is that tranquil hour of morn,
And blest that hour of solemn eve,
When, on the wings of prayer upborne,
The world I leave.
Then is my strength by Thee renewed;
Then are my sins by Thee forgiv’n;
Then dost Thou cheer my solitude
With hopes of Heav’n.
No words can tell what sweet relief
There for my every want I find,
What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
What peace of mind.
Hushed is each doubt, gone ev’ry fear;
My spirit seems in Heav’n to stay;
And e’en the penitential tear
Is wiped away.
Lord, till I reach yon blissful shore,
No privilege so dear shall be
As thus my inmost soul to pour
In prayer to Thee.

My soul is on fire
With a flame burnin' bright till the day that I die
You've taken me higher
From the flat of my back to the stars in the sky 
You're my justifier
You've established my ways and direct me each day
You're my sanctifier
And I'm holy for You everything that I do 
In my heart, I'll always be with You
For my heart will never forsake You
With my heart, I'll always be lovin' You
From my heart, they never can take You away 
My mind is inspired
You have opened my ears, given sight to my eyes
My arms open wider
You have given me love, to give grace, to be kind 
You're my justifier
You've established my ways and direct me each day
You're my sanctifier
And I'm holy for You everything that I do 
I will be with you (I will be with you)
Never forsake you (Never again will I forsake you)
I'll will be loving you (I will be loving you)
Never can take You away 

My God, my Father, dost thou call
thy long-lost wandering child to thee?
And canst thou, wilt thou pardon all?
I come, I come; Lord, save thou me.
O Jesus, art thou passing by
with all thy goodness, grace and power?
And dost thou hear my broken cry?
I come, I come, in mercy's hour.
O Holy Spirit, is it thou,
my tenderest Friend refused too long?
And art thou pleading, striving now?
I come, I come: make weakness strong.
Yes, Lord, I come: thy heart of love
is moving, kindling, drawing mine.
I cast me at thy feet to prove
the bliss, the heaven of being thine.

My God, my Father, make me strong,
When tasks of life seem hard and long,
To greet them with this triumph song,
Thy will be done.
Draw from my timid eyes the veil,
To show, where earthly forces fail,
Thy power and love must still prevail,
Thy will be done.
With confident and humble mind,
Freedom in service I would find,
Praying through every toil assigned,
Thy will be done.
Things deemed impossible I dare;
Thine is the call and Thine the care;
Thy wisdom shall the way prepare;
Thy will be done.
Heaven’s music chimes the glad days in;
Hope soars beyond death, pain and sin;
Faith shouts in triumph, “Love must win";
Thy will be done.

My God, my Father, while I stray
far from my home, on life's rough way,
O teach me from my heart to say,
Thy will be done!
Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
let me be still and murmur not,
or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
Thy will be done!
What though in lonely grief I sigh
for friends beloved, no longer nigh,
submissive still would I reply,
Thy will be done!
If Thou shoulds't call me to resign
what most I prize, it ne'er was mine:
I only yield thee what is thine;
thy will be done! 
Let but my fainting heart be blest
with thy sweet Spirit for its guest,
my God, to thee I leave the rest;
thy will be done!
Renew my will from day to day;
blend it with thine, and take away
all that now makes it hard to say,
Thy will be done!
Then, when on earth I breathe no more
the prayer oft mixed with tears before,
I'll sing upon a happier shore,
Thy will be done!

My God, my God, I cry to Thee;
O why hast Thou forsaken me?
Afar from me, Thou dost not heed,
Though day and night for help I plead.
But Thou art holy in Thy ways,
Enthroned upon Thy people’s praise;
Our fathers put their trust in Thee,
Believed, and Thou didst set them free.
They cried, and, trusting in Thy Name,
Were saved, and were not put to shame;
But in the dust mine honor lies,
While all reproach and all despise.
My words a cause for scorn they make,
The lip they curl, the head they shake,
And, mocking, bid me trust the Lord
Till He salvation shall afford.
My trust on Thee I learned to rest
When I was on my mother’s breast;
From birth Thou art my God alone,
Thy care my life has ever known.
O let Thy strength and presence cheer,
For trouble and distress are near;
Be Thou not far away from Me,
I have no source of help but Thee.
Unnumbered foes would do me wrong,
They press about me, fierce and strong,
Like beasts of prey, their rage they vent,
My courage fails, my strength is spent.
Down unto death Thou leadest me,
Consumed by thirst and agony;
With cruel hate and anger fierce
My helpless hands and feet they pierce.
While on my wasted form they stare,
The garments torn from me they share,
My shame and sorrow heeding not,
And for my robe they cast the lot.
O Lord, afar no longer stay;
O Thou my Helper, haste, I pray;
From death and evil set me free;
I live, for Thou didst answer me.
I live and will declare Thy fame
Where brethren gather in Thy Name;
Where all Thy faithful people meet,
I will Thy worthy praise repeat.

The Lord is my strength, and my fortress, and my deliverer
My shield and the horn of my salvation,
My stronghold and my refuge (repeat)
My God, my Rock,
My God, my Rock
In You I take refuge,
In You will I trust
You are my strength, and my fortress and my deliverer
My shield and the horn of my salvation,
my stronghold and my refuge
The Lord is my light and my salvation.Who shall I fear?
The Lord is the stronghold of my life,
of whom shall I be afraid ? (repeat)
My God, my Rock,
My God, my Rock
In You I take refuge,
In You will I trust
You are my light and my salvation.who shall I fear?
You are the stronghold of my life,
of whom shall I be afraid?
You are the stronghold of my life,
of whom shall I be afraid?
Praise 

My God, accept my heart this day,
And make it always Thine,
That I from Thee no more may stray,
No more from Thee decline.
Before the cross of Him Who died,
Behold, I prostrate fall;
Let every sin be crucified,
Let Christ be all in all.
Anoint me with Thy heavenly grace,
Adopt me for Thine own,
That I may see Thy glorious face,
And worship at Thy throne.
May the dear blood once shed for me
My blest atonement prove
That I from first to last may be
The purchase of Thy love!
Let every thought, and work, and word,
To Thee be ever given;
Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,
And death the gate of Heaven.

My God, my King, Thy praise I sing,
My heart is all Thine own;
My highest powers, my choicest hours,
I yield to Thee alone.
My voice awake, thy part to take;
My soul, the concert join;
Till all around shall catch the sound,
And mix their hymns with mine.
But man is weak Thy praise to speak;
Your God, ye angels, sing;
’Tis yours to see, more near than we,
The glories of our King.
His truth and grace fill time and space;
As large His honors be
Till all that live their homage give
And praise my God with me.

My God, my King, Thy various praise
Shall fill the remnant of my days;
Thy grace employ my humble tongue
Till death and glory raise the song.
The wings of every hour shall bear
Some thankful tribute to Thine ear;
And every setting sun shall see
New works of duty done for Thee.
Thy truth and justice I’ll proclaim;
Thy bounty flows an endless stream;
Thy mercy swift, Thine anger slow,
But dreadful to the stubborn foe.
Thy works with sovereign glory shine,
And speak Thy majesty divine;
Let us upon all shores proclaim
[originally, Let Britain round her shores proclaim]
The sound and honor of Thy Name.
Let distant times and nations raise
The long succession of Thy praise,
And unborn ages make my song
The joy and labor of their tongue.
But who can speak Thy wondrous deeds?
Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds?
Vast and unsearchable Thy ways,
Vast and immortal be Thy praise!

My God, my portion, and my love,
My everlasting all!
I’ve none but Thee in Heav’n above,
Or on this earthly ball.
What empty things are all the skies,
And this inferior clod!
There’s nothing here deserves my joys,
There’s nothing like my God.
In vain the bright, the burning sun
Scatters his feeble light;
’Tis Thy sweet beams create my noon;
If Thou withdraw, ’tis night.
And whilst upon my restless bed,
Amongst the shades I roll,
If my Redeemer shows His head,
’Tis morning with my soul.
To Thee we owe our wealth, and friends,
And health, and safe abode:
Thanks to Thy Name for meaner things,
But they are not my God.
How vain a toy is glitt’ring wealth,
If once compared to Thee!
Or what’s my safety, or my health,
Or all my friends to me?
Were I possessor of the earth,
And called the stars my own,
Without Thy graces and Thyself
I were a wretch undone.
Let others stretch their arms like seas
And grasp in all the shore,
Grant me the visits of Thy face,
And I desire no more.

My God, permit my tongue
This joy, to call Thee mine;
And let my early cries prevail
To taste Thy love divine.
My thirsty, fainting soul
Thy mercy doth implore;
Not travelers in desert lands
Can pant for water more.
Within Thy churches, Lord,
I long to find my place;
Thy power and glory to behold,
And feel Thy quick’ning grace.
For life without Thy love
No relish can afford;
No joy can be compared to this,
To serve and please the Lord.
To Thee I’ll lift my hands,
And praise Thee while I live;
Not the rich dainties of a feast
Such food or pleasure give.
In wakeful hours at night
I call my God to mind;
I think how wise Thy counsels are,
And all Thy dealings kind.
Since thou hast been my help,
To Thee my spirit flies,
And on Thy watchful providence
My cheerful hope relies.
The shadow of Thy wings
My soul in safety keeps;
I follow where my Father leads,
And He supports my steps.

My God, the Spring of all my joys,
The Life of my delights,
The Glory of my brightest days,
And Comfort of my nights!
In darkest shades, if He appear,
My dawning is begun,
He is my soul’s bright morning star,
And He my rising sun.
The opening heav’ns around me shine,
With beams of sacred bliss,
While Jesus shows His heart is mine,
And whispers, I am His.
My soul would leave this heavy clay,
At that transporting word,
Run up with joy the shining way,
T’embrace my dearest Lord.
Fearless of hell and ghastly death,
I’d break through every foe;
The wings of love and arms of faith
Would bear me conqueror through.

My God! my God! and can it be
That I should sin so lightly now,
And think no more of evil thoughts
Than of the wind that waves the bough?
I sin, and Heav’n and earth go round,
As if no dreadful deed were done;
As if Thy blood had never flowed
To hinder sin, or to atone.
I walk the earth with lightsome step,
Smile at the sunshine, breathe the air,
Do my own will, not ever heed
Gethsemane and Thy long prayer.
Shall it be always thus, O Lord?
Wilt Thou not work this hour in me
The grace of Thy Passion merited,
Hatred of self, and love of Thee!
O by the pains of Thy pure love,
Grant me the gift of holy fear;
And by Thy woes and bloody sweat
Wash Thou my guilty conscience clear!
Ever when tempted, make me see,
Beneath the olives’ moon pierced shade,
My God, alone, outstretched, and bruised,
And bleeding, on the earth He made;
And make me feel it was my sin,
As though no other sins there were,
That was to Him Who bears the world
A load that He could scarcely bear.

My gracious Lord, I own Thy right
To every service I can pay,
And call it my supreme delight
To hear Thy dictates, and obey.
What is my being but for Thee,
Its sure support, its noblest end?
’Tis my delight Thy face to see,
And serve the cause of such a Friend.
I would not sigh for worldly joy,
Or to increase my worldly good;
Nor future days nor powers employ
To spread a sounding name abroad.
’Tis to my Savior I would live,
To Him Who for my ransom died;
Nor could all worldly honor give
Such bliss as crowns me at His side.
His work my hoary age shall bless,
When youthful vigor is no more;
And my last hour of life confess
His dying love, His saving power.

My Gracious Redeemer I Love,
His praises aloud I'll proclaim,
And join with the armies above,
To shout His adorable name;
To gaze on His glories divine
Shall be my eternal employ,
And feel them incessantly shine,
My boundless, ineffable joy.
He freely redeemed with His blood
My soul from the confines of hell,
To live on the smiles of my God,
And in His sweet presence to dwell;
To shine with the angels of light,
With saints and with seraphs to sing;
To view with eternal delight
My Jesus, my Savior, my King.
O when shall my spirit exchange
This cell of corruptible clay
For mansions celestial, and range
Through realms of ineffable day?
Oh, when wilt thou bid me ascend,
To join in thy praises above,
To gaze on thee, world without end,
And feast on thy ravishing love?
Nor sorrow, nor sickness, nor pain,
Nor sin, nor temptation, nor fear,
Shall ever molest me again 
Perfection of glory reigns there 
This soul and this body shall shine
In robes of salvation and praise,
And banquet on pleasures divine,
Where God His full beauty displays.

My grieving soul revive, O Lord,
According to Thy Word;
To Thee my ways I have declared
And Thou my prayer hast heard.
Teach me to know Thy holy way
And think upon Thy deeds;
In grief I ask for promised grace
According to my need.
Keep me from falsehood, let Thy law
With me in grace abide;
The way of faithfulness I choose,
Thy precepts are my guide.
I cleave unto Thy truth, O Lord,
From shame deliver me;
In glad obedience I will live
Through strength bestowed by Thee.

My soul is on fire
With a flame burnin' bright till the day that I die
You've taken me higher
From the flat of my back to the stars in the sky

My heart and voice I raise,
To spread Messiah's praise;
Messiah's praise let all repeat:
The universal Lord,
By whose almighty word
Creation rose in form complete.
A servant's form he wore,
And in his body bore
Our dreadful curse on Calvary:
He like a victim stood,
And poured his sacred blood,
To set the guilty captives free.
But soon the Victor rose
Triumphant o'er his foes,
And led the vanquished host in chains:
He threw their empire down,
His foes compelled to own
O'er all the great Messiah reigns.
With mercy's mildest grace,
He governs all our race
In wisdom, righteousness, and love:
Who to Messiah fly
Shall find redemption nigh,
And all his great salvation prove.
Hail, Saviour, Prince of Peace!
Thy kingdom shall increase,
Till all the world thy glory see,
And righteousness abound
As the great deep profound,
And fill the earth with purity.

My heart doth overflow, a goodly theme is mine;
My eager tongue with joyful song doth praise the King divine.
Supremely fair Thou art, Thy lips with grace o’erflow;
His richest blessing evermore doth God on Thee bestow.
Now gird Thee with Thy sword, O strong and mighty One;
In splendid majesty arrayed, more glorious than the sun.
Triumphantly ride forth for meekness, truth and right;
Thine arm shall gain the victory in wondrous deeds of might.
Thy strength shall overcome all those that hate the King,
And under Thy dominion strong the nations Thou shalt bring.
Thy royal throne, O God, forevermore shall stand;
Eternal truth and justice wield the scepter in Thy hand.
Since Thou art sinless found, the Lord, Thy God, confessed,
Anointeth Thee with perfect joy, Thou art supremely blessed.
Thy garments breathe of myrrh and spices sweet and rare;
Glad strains of heav’nly music ring throughout Thy palace fair.
Amid Thy glorious train kings’ daughters waiting stand,
And fairest gems bedeck Thy bride, the queen at Thy right hand.
O royal bride, give heed, and to my words attend;
For Christ, the King, forsake the world and every former friend.

My heart has come to the place of rest,
Leaving it all with Jesus;
The fear of death doth no more molest,
I'm leaving it all with Jesus.
Leaving it all with Jesus,
Leaving it all with Jesus;
My peace today, as on yesterday,
Is leaving it all with Jesus.
I've brought the guilt of my weary soul,
Leaving it all with Jesus;
I've brought not part of it, but the whole,
I'm leaving it all with Jesus.
I'm walking safe in a path unknown,
Leaving it all with Jesus;
I find the path with His blessings strown,
I'm leaving it all with Jesus.
O wounded soul, here is heav'nly balm,
Leaving it all with Jesus;
Then change thy moan to a joyous psalm,
In leaving it all with Jesus.

My heart is fixed, O God, my heart
Is fixed to triumph in Thy grace:
Awake, my lute, and bear a part
My glory is to sing Thy praise,
Till all Thy nature I partake,
And bright in all thine image wake.
Thee will I praise among thine own;
Thee will I to the world extol,
And make Thy truth and goodness known:
Thy goodness, Lord, is over all;
Thy truth and grace the heavens transcend;
Thy faithful mercies never end.
Be Thou exalted, Lord, above
The highest name in earth or heaven;
Let angels sing Thy glorious love,
And bless the Name to sinners given;
All earth and heaven their King proclaim!
Bow every knee to Jesus’ Name!

My heart is fixed, O God,
A grateful song I raise;
Awake, O harp, in joyful strains;
Awake, my soul, to praise.
Among the nations, Lord,
To Thee my song shall rise;
Thy truth is great above the heav’ns,
Thy mercies reach the skies.
Above the heav’ns, O God,
And over all the earth,
Let men exalt Thy glorious Name
And tell Thy matchless worth.
Stretch forth Thy mighty hand
In answer to our prayer,
And let Thine own beloved ones
Thy great salvation share.
The holy God has said,
“All lands shall own My sway;
My people shall My glory share,
The heathen shall obey."
O who will lead our hosts
To triumph o’er the foe,
If Thou shalt cast us off, O God,
Nor with our armies go?
The help of man is vain,
Be Thou our Helper, Lord;
Through Thee we shall do valiantly
If Thou Thine aid afford.

My heart is full of Christ, and longs
Its glorious matter to declare!
Of Him I make my loftier song,
I cannot from His praise forbear;
My ready tongue makes haste to sing
The glories of my heavenly King.
Fairer than all the earth-born race,
Perfect in comeliness Thou art;
Replenished are Thy lips with grace,
And full of love Thy tender heart:
God ever blest! we bow the knee,
And own all fullness dwells in Thee.
Gird on Thy thigh the Spirit’s sword,
And take to Thee Thy power divine;
Stir up Thy strength, almighty Lord,
All power and majesty are Thine:
Assert Thy worship and renown;
O all redeeming God, come down!
Come, and maintain Thy righteous cause,
And let Thy glorious toil succeed;
Dispread the victory of Thy cross,
Ride on, and prosper in Thy deed;
Through earth triumphantly ride on,
And reign in every heart alone.

My heart is resting, O my God—
I will give thanks and sing;
My heart is at the secret source
Of every precious thing.
Now the frail vessel Thou hast made
No hand but Thine shall fill—
For the waters of the Earth have failed,
And I am thirsty still.
I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
And here all day they rise—
I seek the treasure of Thy love,
And close at hand it lies.
And a new song is in my mouth
To long loved music set—
Glory to Thee for all the grace
I have not tasted yet.
Glory to Thee for strength withheld,
For want and weakness known—
And the fear that sends me to Thy breast
For what is most my own.
I have a heritage of joy
That yet I must not see;
But the hand that bled to make it mine
Is keeping it for me.
There is a certainty of love
That sets my heart at rest—
A calm assurance for today
That to be poor is best—
A prayer reposing on His truth
Who hath made all things mine,
That draws my captive will to Him,
And makes it one with Thine.
I will give thanks for suffering now,
For want and toil and loss—
For the death that sin makes hard and slow,
Upon my Savior’s cross—
Thanks for the little spring of love
That gives me strength to say,
If they will leave me part in Him,
Let all things pass away.
Sometimes I long for promised bliss,
But it will not come too late—
And the songs of patient spirits rise
From the place wherein I wait;
While in the faith that makes no haste
My soul has time to see
A kneeling host of Thy redeemed,
In fellowship with me.
There is a multitude around
Responsive to my prayer;
I hear the voice of my desire
Resounding everywhere.
But the earnest of eternal joy,
In every prayer I trace;
I see the glory of the Lord:
On every chastened face.
How oft, in still communion known,
Those spirits have been sent
To share the travail of my soul,
Or show me what it meant!
And I long to do some work of love
No spoiling hand could touch,
For the poor and suffering of Thy flock
Who comfort me so much.
But the yearning thought is mingled now
With the thankful song I sing;
For Thy people know the secret source
Of every precious thing.
The heart that ministers for Thee
In Thy own work will rest;
And the subject spirit of a child
Can serve Thy children best.
Mine be the reverent, listening love,
That waits all day on Thee,
With the service of a watchful heart
Which no one else can see—
The faith that, in a hidden way
No other eye may know,
Finds all its daily work prepared,
And loves to have it so.
My heart is resting, O my God,
My heart is in Thy care—
I hear the voice of joy and health
Resounding everywhere.
“Thou art my portion," saith my soul,
Ten thousand voices say,
And the music of their glad Amen,
Will never die away.

My heart is yearning ever
To reach a place of rest.
Jerusalem, my happy home,
In thee my heart shall never
By sin or grief be pressed.
My heart is yearning ever
To reach that city bright.
Within its radiant portals
None ever sheds a tear;
God’s city bright gives all delight,
No grief nor wail or mortals
Is where the Lamb is near;
Within its radiant portals
None ever sheds a tear.
Their blessed Lord and Savior
Doth rule and govern them
In peace and joy, without alloy,
For sin can enter never
The new Jerusalem;
Their blessed Lord and Savior
Doth rule and govern them.
Behold the goal in glory,
Now shining from afar.
O city of the God of love,
Where no more earthly worry
My happiness shall mar!
Behold the goal in glory,
Now shining from afar.

My heart rejoices in Thy Name,
My God, my help, my trust;
Thou hast preserved my face from shame,
Mine honor from the dust.
“My life is spent with grief," I cried,
“My years consumed in groans,
My strength decays, mine eyes are dried,
And sorrow wastes my bones."
Among mine enemies my name
Was a mere proverb grown,
While to my neighbors I became
Forgotten and unknown.
Slander and fear on every side
Seized and beset me round
I to the throne of grace applied,
And speedy rescue found.
How great deliverance Thou hast wrought
Before the sons of men!
The lying lips to silence brought,
And made their boastings vain!
Thy children from the strife of tongues
Shall Thy pavilion hide;
Guard them from infamy and wrongs,
And crush the sons of pride.
Within Thy secret presence, Lord,
Let me forever dwell;
No fenced city, walled and barred,
Secures a saint so well.
And even I shall conquer
In Jesus’ Name and might;
Tho’ weak and faint, still as a saint
I’ll in the haven anchor,
Sweet haven of delight.
Yea, even I shall conquer
In Jesus’ Name and might.

My heart, that was heavy and sad,
Was made to rejoice and be glad,
And peace without measure I had,
When the Comforter came.
Peace, sweet peace,
Peace when the Comforter came!
My heart that was heavy and sad,
Was made to rejoice and be glad,
And peace without measure I had,
When the Comforter came.
To sin and to evil inclined,
With darkness pervading my mind,
No rest I could anywhere find,
Till the Comforter came.
The voice of thanksgiving I raised,
The Lord, my Redeemer, I praised;
I was at His mercy amazed,
When the Comforter came.

My heart was distressed 'neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah!
He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling while here I remain,
But stand by His grace until the crown I gain.
He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise;
By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, I'm happy and free.
I'll praise my Redeemer, Who has rescued me.
I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.

My heart was glad to hear the welcome sound,
The call to seek Jehovah’s house of prayer;
Our feet are standing here on holy ground,
Within thy gates, thou city grand and fair.
God’s people to Jerusalem repair
To hear his Word and worship Him with praise;
The throne of justice stands eternal there,
Messiah’s throne through endless length of days.
Let earnest prayer be made for Zion’s peace;
Thy sons who hold thee dear shall prosper well;
May blessing in thy palaces increase
And peace within thy walls forever dwell.
For all my brethren and companions’ sakes
My prayer shall be, Let peace in thee abide;
Since God the Lord in thee His dwelling makes,
To thee my love shall never be denied.

When lost among the wild, dark mountains,
Far, far from Thee,
I heard Thy gentle voice, my Savior,
Calling in love to me.
Safe, within Thy arms of mercy,
Never more to roam;
O, let me rest in peace forever,
Safe in my heart’s dear home.
When lost among the wild, dark mountains,
Sad was my cry,
Till softly came the words so tender,
“Fear not, for here am I."
O teach me to adore and praise Thee,
Savior divine;
Now I have made a full surrender,
All that I am is Thine.
Wherever Thou wilt lead, I’ll follow
Close, close to Thee;
One prayer alone my soul is breathing:
Savior, abide with me.

My heav'nly home is bright and fair,
Nor pain nor death can enter there;
Its glitt池ing towers the sun outshine,
That heav'nly mansion shall be mine.
I'm going home, I'm going home,
I'm going home to die no more,
To die no more, to die no more,
I'm going home to die no more.
My Father's home is built on high,
Far, far above the starry sky;
When from this earthly prison free,
That heav'nly mansion mine shall be.
Let others seek a home below,
Which flames devour, or waves o弾rflow;
Be mine a happier lot to own
A heav'nly mansion near the throne.

Praise God, I live in Beulah land,
My house will all the storms withstand;
It is not built on sinking sand,
My home is on the Rock.
My home is on the Rock,
The Everlasting Rock;
I do not fear when storms are near,
My home is on the Rock.
When come life’s trials thick and fast,
When clouds are o’er my pathway cast,
Secure, I can withstand the blast,
My home is on the Rock.
When troubles come that would appall,
When other buildings round me fall,
I rest in Christ, my all in all,
My home is on the Rock.
And when my time has come to die,
I’ll have a mansion in the sky;
But still I’ll sing as ages fly,
My home is on the Rock.

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus’ Name.
On Christ the solid Rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand;
All other ground is sinking sand.
When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.
His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood.
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my Hope and Stay.
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh may I then in Him be found.
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

My hope is in the Lord 
Who gave Him-self for me
And paid the price 
Of all my sin at Cal-va-ry.
For me He died;
For me He lives,
And everlasting life
And light He free-ly gives.
No merit of my own
His anger to suppress
My only hope is found
In Jesus' righteousness
(
And now for me He stands
Before the Father's throne
He shows His wounded hands
And names me as His own
(
His grace has planned it all
'Tis mine but to believe
And recognize His work of love
And Christ receive

My hope, my all, my Savior Thou,
To Thee, lo, now my soul I bow!
I feel the bliss Thy wounds impart,
I find Thee, Savior, in my heart.
Be Thou my strength, be Thou my way;
Protect me through my life’s short day:
In all my acts may wisdom guide,
And keep me, Savior, near Thy side.
Correct, reprove and comfort me,
As I have need my Savior be;
And if I would from Thee depart,
Then clasp me, Savior, to Thy heart.
In fierce temptation’s darkest hour,
Save me from sin and Satan’s power;
Tear every idol from Thy throne,
And reign, my Savior, reign alone.
My suffering time shall soon be o’er;
Then shall I sigh and weep no more;
My ransomed soul shall soar away,
To sing Thy praise in endless day.

My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Oh, may Thy will be mine!
Into Thy hand of love I would my all resign;
Through sorrow, or through joy, conduct me as Thine own,
And help me still to say, my Lord, Thy will be done!
My Jesus, as Thou wilt! If needy here and poor,
Give me Thy people’s bread, their portion rich and sure.
The manna of Thy Word Let my soul feed upon;
And if all else should fail, my Lord, thy will be done.
My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Though seen through many a tear,
Let not my star of hope grow dim or disappear;
Since Thou on earth hast wept, and sorrowed oft alone,
If I must weep with Thee, my Lord, Thy will be done!
My Jesus, as Thou wilt! All shall be well for me;
Each changing future scene I gladly trust with Thee:
Straight to my home above I travel calmly on,
And sing, in life or death, my Lord, Thy will be done!

My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
I love Thee because Thou has first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree.
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I’ll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.

My Jesus, I would ne’er forget,
That hour I spent with Thee;
When there I saw Thy bloody sweat
In dark Gethsemane.
I’ll ne’er forget, I’ll ne’er forget,
I’ll ne’er forgetful be,
When there I saw Thy bloody sweat
In dark Gethsemane.
’Twas in that olive grove I felt
That Thou hadst died for me;
Alas, how great I saw my guilt
While in Gethsemane.
I thought of how Thy heart did throb,
While “all" Thine own did flee,
And left Thee with the cruel mob,
In sad Gethsemane.
’Twas there I felt my grief and shame
In oft forsaking Thee,
How precious was Thy very Name
In dear Gethsemane.
Should e’er our love to Thee grow cold,
And we forgetful be,
We’ll call to mind Thy love untold
While in Gethsemane.

My latest sun is sinking fast,
My race is nearly run;
My strongest trials now are past,
My triumph is begun.
O come, angel band,
Come and around me stand;
O bear me away on your snowy wings
To my eternal home;
O bear me away on your snowy wings
To my eternal home.
I know I’m near the holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dear,
For I hear the waves on Jordan’s banks,
The crossing must be near.
I’ve almost reached my heav’nly home,
My spirit loudly sings;
Thy holy ones, behold, they come!
I hear the noise of wings.
O bear my longing heart to Him,
Who bled and died for me;
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin,
And gives me victory.

My life, dear Lord, I give to Thee
In humble faith and loyalty,
To be Thine own in what is planned,
And heed with joy Thy love’s command.
Show me the trails that turn and climb
Through lonely deeps to heights sublime,
Yet never lose their touch with life,
Its endless round of peace and strife.
I pray for tasks that ease the load
On other hearts along the road;
And love forgiving, patient, tried,
To quicken faith and hope beside.
Gird me with light whose rays and heat
Shall blaze a path to Thy blest seat,
That halting steps, no more afraid,
May reach the goals for which they’ve prayed.
O grant me grace to serve with Thee
In love unfailing, pure, and free;
Guide me in trails which few have trod,
Whose winding ways lead home to God.

My life flows on in endless song;
Above earth’s lamentation
I hear the sweet though far off hymn
That hails a new creation:
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear the music ringing;
It finds an echo in my soul—
How can I keep from singing?
What though my joys and comforts die?
The Lord my Savior liveth;
What though the darkness gather round!
Songs in the night He giveth:
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge clinging;
Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth,
How can I keep from singing?
I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;
I see the blue above it;
And day by day this pathway smoothes
Since first I learned to love it:
The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,
A fountain ever springing:
All things are mine since I am His—
How can I keep from singing?

My life, my love I give to Thee,
Thou Lamb of God Who died for me;
O may I ever faithful be,
My Savior and my God!
I’ll live for Him Who died for me,
How happy then my life shall be!
I’ll live for Him Who died for me,
My Savior and my God!
I now believe Thou dost receive,
For Thou hast died that I might live;
And now henceforth I trust in Thee,
My Savior and my God!
O Thou Who died on Calvary,
To save my soul and make me free,
I’ll consecrate my life to Thee,
My Savior and my God!

My light and my salvation, O Lord, whom shall I fear?
You are my life’s great stronghold when evil men come near.
Though enemies attack me, my heart will never fear.
Though war break out against me, I’m confident you’re near.
One thing I ask and seek, Lord: to dwell with you always,
To gaze upon your beauty and seek you all my days.
For in the day of trouble, you’ll hide me, keep me safe.
My head will be exalted; I’ll sing and shout your praise.
Hear now my voice and answer; be merciful I pray.
Your face, Lord, I seek daily; do not turn me away.
For you have been my helper; do not reject me, God.
Though family may forsake me, I know that you will not.
Teach me your way, my Savior; in straight paths may I walk.
Don’t let my foes oppress me with false and vicious talk.
Of this I still am certain: I’ll see God’s goodness yet.
Wait for the Lord Jehovah; be strong, take heart, and wait

I have a Friend so precious,
So very dear to me,
He loves me with a tender love,
He loves me faithfully;
I could not live apart from Him,
I love to feel Him nigh;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.
Sometimes I’m faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak;
And as He bids me lean on Him,
His help I’ll gladly seek;
He leads me in the path of light,
Beneath a sunny sky;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.
He knows how much I love Him,
He knows I love Him well;
But with what love He loveth me,
My tongue can never tell;
It is an everlasting love
In ever rich supply;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.
I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys,
I tell Him all that pleases me,
I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
Hs tells me what to try;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.
He knows how I am longing
Some weary soul to win,
And so He bids me go and speak
A loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.

Up from the grave He arose
My Lord arose
My Jesus walked on water and He walked on solid ground (walked on ground)
He healed the lame, He made them walk, He's working even now
He sent the Holy Spirit and He comforts me each day
He intercedes for me each time I pray
My Lord arose (rose)
Up from the grave to conquer death
My Lord arose (rose)
Up on the third day filled with breath
He died (He died), He rose (He rose), I'm going to meet Him and Heaven knows
The tomb is empty 'cause my Lord arose
My Jesus knows when I am happy, knows when I am sad (when I am sad)
He knows when I am burdened and each trouble that I've had
He knows when I'm discouraged, even when I'm feeling low
Don't have to tell Him 'cause my Jesus knows
He gave up everything on earth to save me from my sin (from my sin)
He said He's coming back so He can take me home with Him
I never have to doubt a single thing my Savior said
He rose again and is no longer dead
He arose a victor from the dark domain
And He lives forever with His saints to reign
He arose (He arose), He arose (He arose)
Hallelujah Christ arose
(Christ arose)
The tomb is empty 'cause my Lord arose
Christ arose

My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
With joy my being thrills.
Out of the ivory palaces,
Into a world of woe,
Only His great eternal love
Made my Savior go.
His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with teardrops start.
His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch.
In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heav’nly home,
To dwell forevermore.

My Lord, I do not ask to stand
As king or prince of high degree;
I only pray that hand in hand
A child and I may come to Thee.
To teach a tender voice to pray,
Two childish eyes Thy face to see—
Two feet to guide in Thy straight way;
This fervently I ask of Thee.
O grant Thy patience to impart
Thy holy law, Thy words of truth;
Give, Lord, Thy grace, that my whole heart
May overflow with love for youth.
As step by step we tread the way,
Trusting, and confident, and free
A child and I shall, day by day,
Find sweet companionship with Thee.

My Lord, my Life, my Love,
to thee, to thee I call;
I cannot live if thou remove:
thou art my joy, my all.
My only sun to cheer
the darkness where I dwell;
the best and only true delight
my song hath found to tell.
To thee in very heaven
the angels owe their bliss;
to thee the saints, whom thou hast called
where perfect pleasure is.
And how shall man, thy child,
without thee happy be,
who hath no comfort nor desire
in all the world but thee?
Return my Love, my Life,
thy grace hath won my heart;
if thou forgive, if thou return,
I will no more depart.

My Lord, you wore no royal crown;
you did not wield the powers of state,
nor did you need a scholar's gown
or priestly robe, to make you great.
You never used a killer's sword
to end an unjust tyranny;
your only weapon was your word,
for truth alone could set us free.
You did not live a world away
in hermit's cell or desert cave,
but felt our pain and shared each day
with those you came to seek and save.
You made no mean or cunning move,
chose no unworthy compromise,
but carved a track of burning love
through tangles of deceit and lies.
You came unequaled, undeserved,
to be what we were meant to be;
to serve, instead of being served,
to pay for our perversity.
So when I stumble, set me right;
command my life as you require;
let all your gifts be my delight
and you, my Lord, my one desire.

My Lord, how full of sweet content;
I pass my years of banishment!
Where’er I dwell, I dwell with Thee,
In Heaven, in earth, or on the sea.
To me remains nor place nor time;
My country is in every clime;
I can be calm and free from care
On any shore, since God is there.
While place we seek, or place we shun
The soul finds happiness in none;
But with a God to guide our way,
’Tis equal joy, to go or stay.
Could I be cast where Thou are not,
That were indeed a dreadful lot:
But regions none remote I call,
Secure of finding God in all.

My Lord, I did not choose You,
For that could never be;
My heart would still refuse You,
Had You not chosen me.
You took the sin that stained me,
You cleansed me, made me new;
Of old You have ordained me,
That I should live in You.
Unless Your grace had called me
And taught my op’ning mind,
The world would have enthralled me,
To heav’nly glories blind.
My heart knows none above You;
For Your rich grace I thirst;
I know that if I love You,
You must have loved me first.

My Lord, my Love, was crucified,
He all the pains did bear;
But in the sweetness of His rest
He makes His servants share.
How sweetly rest Thy saints above
Which in Thy bosom lie;
The Church below doth rest in hope
Of that felicity.
Thou, Lord, Who daily feed’st Thy sheep,
Mak’st them a weekly feast;
Thy flocks meet in their several folds
Upon this day of rest.
Welcome and dear unto my soul
Are these sweet feasts of love;
But what a Sabbath shall I keep
When I shall rest above!
I bless Thy wise and wondrous love,
Which binds us to be free;
Which makes us leave our earthly snares,
That we may come to Thee.
I come, I wait, I hear, I pray,
Thy footsteps, Lord, I trace;
I sing to think this is the way
Unto my Savior’s face.

My Lord, my Master, at Thy feet adoring,
I see Thee bowed beneath Thy load of woe;
For me, a sinner, is Thy life blood pouring;
For Thee, my Savior, scarce my tears will flow.
Thine own disciple to the Jews has sold Thee,
With friendship’s kiss and loyal word he came;
How oft of faithful love my lips have told Thee,
While Thou hast seen my falsehood and my shame.
With taunts and scoffs they mock what seems Thy weakness,
With blows and outrage adding pain to pain;
Thou art unmoved and steadfast in Thy meekness;
When I am wronged how quickly I complain!
My Lord, my Savior, when I see Thee wearing
Upon Thy bleeding brow the crown of thorn,
Shall I for pleasure live, or shrink from bearing
Whate’er my lot may be of pain or scorn?
O Victim of Thy love, O pangs most healing,
O saving death, O wounds that I adore,
O shame most glorious! Christ, before Thee kneeling,
I pray Thee keep me Thine for evermore.

My Lord, my Truth, my Way,
[originally, Jesus, my Truth, my Way]
My sure, unerring light,
On Thee my feeble steps I stay,
Which Thou wilt guide aright.
My Wisdom and my Guide,
My Counsellor Thou art;
O never let me leave Thy side,
Or from Thy paths depart!
I lift my eyes to Thee,
Thou gracious, bleeding Lamb,
That I may now enlightened be,
And never put to shame.
Never will I remove
Out of Thy hands my cause;
But rest in Thy redeeming love,
And hang upon Thy cross.
Teach me the happy art
In all things to depend
On Thee; O never, Lord, depart,
But love me to the end!
Still stir me up to strive
With Thee in strength divine;
And every moment, Lord, revive
This fainting soul of mine.
Persist to save my soul
Throughout the fiery hour,
Till I am every whit made whole,
And show forth all thy power.
Through fire and water bring
Into the wealthy place;
And teach me the new song to sing,
When perfected in grace.
O make me all like Thee,
Before I hence remove!
Settle, confirm, and stablish me,
And build me up in love.
Let me Thy witness live,
When sin is all destroyed;
And then my spotless soul receive,
And take me home to God.

My Lord, what a morning!
My Lord, what a morning!
O my Lord, what a morning!
When the stars begin to fall.
You’ll hear a sinner mourn,
To wake the nations underground,
Looking to my God’s right hand,
When the stars begin to fall.
You’ll hear a sinner pray,
To wake the nations underground,
Looking to my God’s right hand,
When the stars begin to fall.
You’ll hear a Christian shout,
To wake the nations underground,
Looking to my God’s right hand,
When the stars begin to fall.
You’ll hear a Christian sing,
To wake the nations underground,
Looking to my God’s right hand,
When the stars begin to fall.

(It's burning inside) Hey, and it's all because of You
(My love's alive) It must be destiny
(My love won't die) 

My Maker and my King,
To Thee my all I owe;
Thy sovereign bounty is the spring
Whence all my blessings flow;
Thy sovereign bounty is the spring
Whence all my blessings flow.
The creature of Thy hand,
On Thee alone I live;
My God, Thy benefits demand
More praise than I can give.
My God, Thy benefits demand
More praise than I can give.
Lord, what can I impart
When all is Thine before?
Thy love demands a thankful heart;
The gift, alas! how poor.
Thy love demands a thankful heart;
The gift, alas! how poor.
O! let Thy grace inspire
My soul with strength divine;
Let every word and each desire
And all my days be Thine.
Let every word and each desire
And all my days be Thine.

My Master was a worker,
With daily work to do,
And he who would be like Him
Must be a worker, too.
Then welcome honest labor,
And honest labor’s fare,
For where there is a worker,
The Master’s man is there.
My Master was a comrade,
A trusty friend and true,
And he who would be like Him,
Must be a comrade, too.
In happy hour of singing,
In silent hours of care,
Where goes a loyal comrade,
The Master’s man is there.
My Master was a helper,
The woes of life He knew,
And he who would be like Him
Must be a helper, too.
The burden will grow lighter,
If each will take a share,
And where there is a helper,
The Master’s man is there.
Then, brothers brave and manly,
Together let us be,
For He, who is our Master,
The Man of men was He.
The men who would be like Him
Are wanted everywhere,
And where they love each other
The Master’s men are there.

My Maker, be Thou nigh
The light of life to give
And guide me with Thine eye
While here on earth I live.
To Thee my heart I tender
And all my powers surrender;
Make it my one endeavor
To love and serve Thee ever.
Upon Thy promise I rely;
My Maker, be Thou nigh.
My Savior, wash me clean
With Thy most precious blood,
That takes away all sin
And seals my peace with God.
My soul in peace abideth
When in Thy wounds it hideth.
There I find full salvation
And freedom from damnation.
Without Thee lost, defiled by sin,
My Savior, wash me clean.
My Comforter, give power
That I may stand secure
When in temptation’s hour
The world and sin allure.
The Son to me revealing,
Inspire my thought and feeling,
His Word of grace to ponder,
Nor let me from Him wander.
On me Thy gifts and graces shower:
My Comforter, give power!
O Holy Trinity!
To Whom I all things owe,
Thine image graciously
Within my heart bestow.
Choose me, though weak and lowly,
To be Thy temple holy
Where praise shall rise unending
For grace so condescending.
O heav’nly bliss, Thine own to be,
O Holy Trinity!

This book is all that’s left me now!
Tears will unbidden start!
With falt’ring lip and throbbing brow
I press it to my heart.
For many generations passed,
Here is our fam’ly tree!
My mother’s hands this Bible clasped,
She dying gave it me.
Ah, well do I remember those
Whose names these records bear!
Who round the hearthstone used to close,
After the evening prayer;
And speak of what this volume said,
In tones my heart would thrill:
Though they are with the silent dead,
Here are they living still.
My father read this holy book
To brothers, sisters dear!
How calm was my poor mother’s look,
Who leaned God’s Word to hear!
Her angel face! I see it yet!
What thronging mem’ries come!
Again that little group is met
Within these halls of home!
Thou truest friend man ever knew!
Thy constancy I’ve tried!
When all were false I found Thee true,
My Counselor and Guide.
The mines of earth no treasures give,
From me this book could buy,
For teaching me the way to live,
It taught me how to die.

There’s a dear and precious Book,
Though it’s worn and faded now,
Which recalls those happy days of long ago,
When I stood at mother’s knee,
With her hand upon my brow,
And I heard her voice in gentle tones and low.
Blessed Book, precious Book,
On thy dear old tear stained leaves I love to look;
Thou art sweeter day by day, as I walk the narrow way
That leads at last to that bright home above.
As she read the stories o’er
Of those mighty men of old,
Of Joseph and of Daniel and their trials,
Of little David bold,
Who became a king at last,
Of Satan and his many wicked wiles.
Then she read of Jesus’ love,
As He blessed the children dear,
How He suffered, bled and died upon the tree;
Of His heavy load of care,
Then she dried my flowing tears
With her kisses as she said it was for me.
Well, those days are past and gone,
But their memory lingers still
And the dear old Book each day has been my guide;
And I seek to do His will,
As my mother taught me then,
And ever in my heart His Words abide.

I never can forget the day
I heard my mother kindly say,
“You’re leaving now my tender care;
Remember, child, your mother’s prayer."
Whene’er I think of her so dear,
I feel her angel spirit near;
A voice comes floating on the air,
Reminding me of Mother’s prayer.
I never can forget the voice
That always made my heart rejoice;
Though I have wandered God knows where,
Still I remember Mother’s prayer.
Though years have gone, I can’t forget
Those words of love—I hear them yet;
I see her by the old arm chair,
My mother dear, in humble prayer.
I never can forget the hour
I felt the Savior’s cleansing pow’r.
My sin and guilt be canceled there,
’Twas there He answered Mother’s prayer.
O praise the Lord for saving grace!
We’ll meet up yonder face to face;
The home above together share,
In answer to my mother’s prayer.

’Twas in the days of careless youth, when life was fair and bright,
And ne’er a tear, and scarce a fear o’ercast my day and night,
As, in the quiet eventide, I passed her kneeling there,
That just one word, my name, I heard my name in mother’s prayer.
I thought but little of it then, tho’ rev’rence touched my heart,
To her whose love sought from above for me the better part;
But when life’s sterner battles came with many a subtle snare,
Oft that one word, in thought I heard my name in mother’s prayer.
I wandered on, and heeded not, God’s oft repeated call
To turn from sin, to live for Him, and trust to Him my all;
But when at last, convinced of sin, I sank in deep despair,
My hope awoke, when mem’ry spoke my name in mother’s prayer.
That pleading heart, that soul so tried, has gone into her rest,
But still with me for aye shall be the mem’ry of her trust.
And when I cross the Jordan’s tide, and meet her over there,
We’ll praise the Lord, Who blessed that word, my name in mother’s prayer.

My only hope is You (My only hope is You)
Jesus My only hope is You (Yes my hope is You Lord)
From early in the morning to late at night
My only hope is You
(And my only peace) My only peace is You (My only peace is You)
Jesus My only peace is You (Yes my peace is You Lord)
From early in the morning to late at night
My only peace is You
(And my only joy) My only joy is You (My only joy is You)
Jesus My only joy is You (Yes my joy is You Lord)
From early in the morning to late at night
My only joy is You
(Yes all that I need) All that I need is You (All that I need is You)
Jesus all that I need is You (All I need is You Lord)
From early in the morning to late at night
All that I need is You
(And my only hope) My only hope is You (My only hope is You)
Jesus My only hope is You (Yes my hope is You Lord)
From early in the morning to late at night
My only hope is You
From early in the morning to late at night
My only hope is You

O theme with love and mercy fraught,
Salvation full and free,
That Christ upon the cross has wrought
For me, for me:
This shall be my only plea,
This shall be my only plea,
That Christ was crucified for me,
For me, for me.
When dreadful sin my soul assails,
And death shall compass me,
That Christ o’er sin and death prevails
For me, for me:
And when before the throne I stand,
And judgment set shall be,
That Christ fulfilled the law’s command
For me, for me:

My opening eyes with rapture see
The dawn of this returning day;
My thoughts, O God, ascend to Thee,
While thus my early vows I pay.
I yield my heart to Thee alone,
Nor would receive another guest:
Eternal King, erect Thy throne,
And reign sole monarch in my breast.
O bid this trifling world retire,
And drive each carnal thought away;
Nor let me feel one vain desire,
One sinful thought, through all the day.
Then, to Thy courts when I repair,
My soul shall rise on joyful wing,
The wonders of Thy love declare,
And join the strains which angels sing.

My own dear land, where’er my footsteps wander,
Ever to thee my heart still turns again;
To thee my love grows ever fonder, fonder,
Till in its might it is akin to pain.
Ever to thee I’m bound in love and duty;
No dearer land to me in all the earth;
By all sweet ties of home and love and beauty,
To thee I cleave, dear land that gave me birth.
Yet I look on, beyond earth’s habitation,
To where a home of rarer vision gleams,
Fairer than earth’s most wonderful creation
Bathed in the light of Heav’n’s own morning beams.
There we shall meet, from every clime and nation,
There we shall meet in answer to the call,
There we shall meet in joyous consecration,
Sons of one Father, brothers one and all.

My people, give ear, attend to My Word,
In parables new deep truths shall be heard;
The wonderful story our fathers made known
To children succeeding by us must be shown.
Instructing our sons we gladly record
The praises, the works, the might of the Lord,
For He hath commanded that what He hath done
Be passed in tradition from father to son.
Let children thus learn from history’s light
To hope in our God and walk in His sight,
The God of their fathers to fear and obey,
And ne’er like their fathers to turn from His way.
The story be told, to warn and restrain,
Of hearts that were hard, rebellious, and vain,
Of soldiers who faltered when battle was near,
Who kept not God’s cov’nant nor walked in His fear.
God’s wonderful works to them He had shown,
His marvelous deeds their fathers had known;
He made for their pathway the waters divide,
His glorious pillar of cloud was their guide.
He gave them to drink, relieving their thirst,
And forth from the rock caused water to burst;
Yet faithless they tempted their God, and they said,
Can He Who gave water supply us with bread?
Jehovah was wroth because they forgot
To hope in their God, and trusted Him not;
Yet gracious, He opened the doors of the sky
And rained down the manna in richest supply.
With bread from on high their need He supplied,
And more did He do when thankless they sighed;
The strong winds commanding from south and from east
He sent them abundance of quail for their feast.
Though well they were filled, their folly they chose;
Till God in His wrath o’erwhelmed them with woes;
He slew of their strongest and smote their young men,
But still unbelieving they sinned even then.
Because of their sin He smote with His rod,
And then they returned and sought for their God;
Their Rock and Redeemer was God the Most high,
Yet false were their praises, their promise a lie.
Not right with their God in heart and in will,
They faithlessly broke His covenant still;
But He, in compassion, reluctant to slay,
Forgave them and oft turned His anger away.
His pity was great, though often they sinned,
For they were but flesh, a swift passing wind;
Yet though His compassion and grace they beheld,
They tempted and grieved Him and often rebelled.
They limited God, the Most Holy One,
And hindered the work His grace had begun;
The hand that was mighty to save they forgot,
The day of redemption remembering not.
Ungrateful and blind, no longer they thought
Of wonders and signs and mighty deeds wrought,
Of how all the rivers of Egypt ran red,
And plagues in God’s anger were heaped on their head.
They thought not of how, their freedom to gain,
In Egypt’s abodes the first born were slain,
And how all God’s people were led forth like sheep,
The flock He delighted in safety to keep.
Unharmed through the sea, where perished their foe,
He caused them with ease and safety to go;
His holy land gaining, in peace they were brought
To dwell in the mountain the Lord’s hand had bought.
He gave them the land, a heritage fair;
The nations that dwelt in wickedness there
He drove out before them with great overthrow
And gave to His people the tents of the foe.
Again they rebelled and tempted the Lord,
Unfaithful, they turned to idols abhorred,
And God in His anger withdrew from them then,
No longer delighting to dwell among men.
He gave them to death in battle, although
His glory and strength were scorned by the foe;
Their young men were fallen, their maidens unwed,
Their priest slain in battle, none wept for the dead.
Then mercy awoke, the Lord in His might
Returned, and the foes were scattered in flight;
Again to His people His favor He showed
And chose in Mount Zion to fix His abode.
His servant He called, a shepherd of sheep,
From tending his flock, the people to keep;
So David their shepherd with wisdom and might
Protected and fed them and led them aright.

Lord (Lord), please listen to me and answer me
I'm poor and helpless
Protect me, I'll worship you
And save me, Your servant who trusts you
Hear my prayer (hear my prayer), O Lord
And listen when I cry for mercy
I give my life (give my life) to you
And let all your happiness surround me
I call (I call) to you in times of trials (in times of trials)
Please listen and answer my plea
Lord (Lord), there's no God like you
I'll honor you, all nations will worship
Love and faithfulness
Give me your strength and show me your goodness
Teach me what you want me to do
I'll live by your truth completely
Unite my heart to fear your name
Open my life that I might see
I call to you in times of trials
Please listen and answer my plea

Was it so very long ago you came to live on earth?
When will I ever comprehend the value of the Savior's birth?
A man with rough, but gentle hands, a carpenter by trade
I want so much to understand the sacrifice the Father gave
And in the silence I can hear a voice that calls to me
Sometimes it comes in loud and clear, sometimes I'm just not listening
The rains have come, the winds have blown, and stronger for the storm I stand
Amazing grace (amazing grace), I've come to know (I've come to know) while 
clinging tightly to your hand
Lord, help me hear that voice inside, the message coming through
Please take my heart and amplify the love I have for you
Please take my heart and amplify the love I have for you

In a day that is not far,
At the blazing judgment bar,
Even now the awful summons I can hear;
I must meet the mighty God,
I must face His holy Word,
I must stand before the judgment bar.
Oh, my record will be there,
Be its pages dark or fair,
When I stand before the judgment bar.
When the books shall open be,
In that morning by and by,
Oh, my record, oh, my record will be there.
I must meet each broken vow,
That I hold so lightly now,
Every heartache I have caused, each sigh, each tear;
Things that time cannot erase,
I must meet them face to face,
When I stand before the judgment bar.
Every secret lust and thought
There shall be to judgment brought,
When the Lord in all His glory shall appear;
All the deeds of darkest night
Shall come out to greet the light,
When I stand before the judgment bar.
I must meet my cankered gold,
For whose greed my life was sold,
It shall mock me in the judgment’s lurid glare;
Saying we have sold for naught,
All the Savior’s blood has bought,
You must stand before the judgment bar.
Let me turn and seek the Lord,
Let me trust His holy Word,
Let me bow and call upon Him while He’s near;
Then when I my record face,
He will answer in my place
When I stand before the judgment bar.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood, He purchased me.
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.
I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.
I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I’ll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin, and death, and hell.
I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His heav’nly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God with Him to be.

For I know my redeemer lives,
and in the end he will stand on the earth.
For I know my redeemer lives,
and in the end he will reign on the earth.
Though my flesh it be destroyed,
yet with my eyes I will see God.
For I know that my redeemer lives,
and I will stand with him on that day.
For I know that my redeemer lives
and I will stand with him on that day.
How my heart it yearns within me,
for the day when Jesus returns.
How my heart it yearns within me,
for the day when Jesus shall reign.

My refuge is the God of love;
Why do my foes insult and cry,
“Fly like a timorous, trembling dove,
To distant woods or mountains fly?"
If government be all destroyed,
That firm foundation of our peace,
And violence make justice void,
Where shall the righteous seek redress?
The Lord in Heav’n has fixed His throne,
His eye surveys the world below:
To Him all mortal things are known,
His eyelids search our spirits through.
If He afflicts His saints so far,
To prove their love and try their grace,
What may the bold transgressors fear?
His very soul abhors their ways.
On impious wretches He shall rain
Tempests of brimstone, fire and death;
Such as He kindled on the plain
Of Sodom, with His angry breath.
The righteous Lord loves righteous souls,
Whose thoughts and actions are sincere;
And with a gracious eye beholds
The men that His own image bear.

Deep and deeper fell the shadows,
Nearer seemed the golden strand,
And my trusting heart was waiting,
Passive in my Savior’s hands;
O how brightly o’er my spirit
Came a radiance from afar,
Like the blush of early morning,
Like the rising of a star.
I was waiting, calmly waiting,
Not a fear was in my breast;
I had trusted my Redeemer,
And in Him was now my rest.
Nearer seemed the shining portals,
But the Master said to me,
?There are sheaves that must be garnered
Ere the reaping dawns for thee;
Yet I know that thou wert weary,
And I bade thy heart repose
By a healing stream that murmurs
Where the Rose of Sharon grows.?
In the silent hours of midnight,
When my waking thoughts take wings,
O the tranquil peace He gives me,
And the hallowed songs He brings!
He has crowned me with His blessing,
And I now by faith can say,
I am going forth with vigor,
Still rejoicing on my way.

My righteous God, Who oft of old
Hast saved from troubles manifold,
Give answer when I call to Thee,
Be gracious now and hear my plea.
How long, O men, will ye defame
How long My glory turn to shame,
How long will ye vain follies prize,
How long pursue deceit and lies?
But know, the Lord has set apart
The man of godly life and heart
To be His favored one for aye;
Jehovah hears me when I pray.
In reverence wait, from sin depart,
In meditation calm your heart;
Hold fast the right, be true and just,
And in Jehovah put your trust.
O who will show us any good,
Exclaims the faithless multitude;
But lift on us, O Lord, we pray,
The brightness of Thy face this day.
More joy from Thee has filled my heart
Than great abundance could impart;
I lay me down to peaceful sleep,
For Thou, O Lord, dost safely keep.

My rock (my rock), my shield (my shield), my Jesus (my Jesus) is real (He's 
real)
I can feel Him (I can feel Him) deep within (deep within) my soul
One day (one day) He saved my soul (He saved my soul), and He made (and He made 
me) me free and whole (free and whole)
My Lord (my Lord), He's real (He's real), I can feel Him in my soul
One night (one night), I repented (I repented), I fell down on bended knees (I 
fell down on my bended knees)
Cried Lord (I cried Lord), have mercy (have mercy), won't you save my soul from 
sin
I'm walking (I'm walking), not alone (not alone), 'cause I'm headed straight for 
home (I'm headed straight for home)
My Lord (my Lord), He's real (He's real), I can feel Him in my soul
Come to Jesus (come to Jesus), repent (repent), get your feet on solid rock (get 
your feet on solid rock)
He's the one (He's the one) who can help you (who can help you), He will hear 
you when you cry
It's Jesus (it's Jesus), my Savior (my Savior), He's a friend and faithful God 
(He's my friend and faithful God)
My Lord (my Lord), He's real (He's real), He will lead you to the other side
My Lord (my Lord), He's real (He's real), I can feel Him in my soul

When my life work is ended, and I cross the swelling tide,
When the bright and glorious morning I shall see;
I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side,
And His smile will be the first to welcome me.
I shall know Him, I shall know Him,
And redeemed by His side I shall stand,
I shall know Him, I shall know Him,
By the print of the nails in His hand.
Oh, the soul thrilling rapture when I view His blessed face,
And the luster of His kindly beaming eye;
How my full heart will praise Him for the mercy, love and grace,
That prepare for me a mansion in the sky.
Oh, the dear ones in glory, how they beckon me to come,
And our parting at the river I recall;
To the sweet vales of Eden they will sing my welcome home;
But I long to meet my Savior first of all.
Through the gates to the city in a robe of spotless white,
He will lead me where no tears will ever fall;
In the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight;
But I long to meet my Savior first of all.

behold Thy life

My Savior, my almighty Friend,
When I begin Thy praise,
Where will the growing numbers end,
The numbers of Thy grace?
Thou art my everlasting trust,
Thy goodness I adore;
And since I knew Thy graces first,
I speak Thy glories more.
My feet shall travel all the length
Of the celestial road,
And march with courage in Thy strength,
To see my Father God.
When I am filled with sore distress
For some surprising sin,
I’ll plead Thy perfect righteousness,
And mention none but Thine.
How will my lips rejoice to tell
The victories of my King!
My soul, redeemed from sin and hell,
Shall Thy salvation bring.
My tongue shall all the day proclaim
My Savior and my God;
His death has brought my foes to shame,
And drowned them in His blood.
Awake, awake, my tuneful powers;
With this delightful song
I’ll entertain the darkest hours
Nor think the season long.

My Savior, on the word of truth
In earnest hope I live;
I ask for all the precious things
Thy boundless love can give.
I look for many a lesser light
About my path to shine;
But chiefly long to walk with Thee,
And only trust in Thine.
In holy expectation held,
Thy strength my heart shall stay,
For Thy right hand will never let
My trust be cast away.
Yea, Thou hast kept me near Thy feet,
In many a deadly strife,
By the stronghold of hope in Thee,
The hope of endless life.
Thou knowest that I am not blest
As Thou wouldst have me be,
Till all the peace and joy of faith
Possess my soul in Thee
And still I seek ’mid many fears,
With yearnings unexpressed,
The comforts of Thy strengthening love,
Thy soothing, settling rest.
It is not as Thou wilt with me,
Till, humbled in the dust;
I know no place in all my heart
Wherein to put my trust.
Until I find, O Lord, in Thee,
The Lowly and the Meek,
That fullness which Thy own redeemed
Go nowhere else to seek.
Then, O my Savior, on my soul,
Cast down, but not dismayed,
Still be Thy chastening, healing hand
In tender, mercy laid.
And while I wait for all Thy joys,
My yearning heart to fill,
Teach me to walk and work with Thee,
And at Thy feet sit still.

My Savior sinners doth receive
Who find no rest and no salvation,
To whom no man can comfort give,
So great their guilt and condemnation;
For whom the world is all too small,
Their sins both them and God appall;
With whom the Law itself hath broken,
On whom its judgment hath been spoken—
To them the Gospel hope doth give:
My Savior sinners doth receive.
My Savior sinners doth receive.
A love more deep than mother-love,
With which His heart was overflowing,
Drew Him on earth from Heav’n above,
On sinners boundless grace bestowing,
He in their stead a curse became,
He bore the cross with all its shame;
Brought full atonement by His suffering,
Gave up His life for them an offering.
This comfort doth the Gospel give:
My Savior sinners doth receive.
My Savior sinners doth receive.
His loving bosom still remains
A haven for the heavy laden;
Christ frees them from their guilty stains,
Their burdened hearts doth ease and gladden.
He casts into th’unfathomed sea
The load of their iniquity;
He gives assurance by His Spirit
That they are saved through His own merit.
Yea, they shall live who this believe:
My Savior sinners doth receive.
My Savior sinners doth receive.
Say not: “My sins are far too great,
His mercy I have scorned and slighted,
Now my repentance is too late;
I came not when His love invited."
O trembling sinner, have no fear;
In penitence to Christ draw near.
Come now, though conscience still is chiding;
Accept His mercy, e’er abiding.
Come; blest are they who this believe:
My Savior sinners doth receive.
My Savior sinners doth receive.
Oh, draw us ever unto Thee,
Thou Friend of sinners, gracious Savior;
Help us that we may fervently
Desire Thy pardon, peace and favor.
When guilty conscience doth reprove,
Reveal to us Thy heart of love.
May we, our wretchedness beholding,
See then Thy pardoning grace unfolding
And say: “To God all glory be:
My Savior, Christ, receiveth me.
My Savior, Christ, receiveth me."

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner, condemned, unclean.
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!
For me it was in the garden
He prayed: "Not My will, but Thine."
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!
In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!
He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
’Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
O how marvelous! O how wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!

My Savior’s praises I will sing,
And all His love express;
Whose mercies each returning day
Proclaim His faithfulness.
“Every day will I bless Thee!
Every day will I bless Thee!
And I will praise, will praise Thy Name
For ever and ever!"
Redeemed by His almighty power,
My Savior and my King;
My confidence in Him I place,
To Him my soul would cling.
On Thee alone, my Savior, God,
My steadfast hopes depend;
And to Thy holy will my soul
Submissively would bend.
O grant Thy Holy Spirit’s grace,
And aid my feeble powers,
That gladly I may follow Thee
Thro’ all my future hours.

My sheep hear My voice, and the path that I take,
They follow wherever I go;
My sheep know My voice and come at my call,
But a stranger’s voice do they not know.
My sheep know My voice, and day by day
They abide in the fold and go not astray,
They love Me because I have made them my choice,
And they follow My call for My sheep know My voice.
My sheep know My voice, and the pastures of green,
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know My voice and the cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.
My sheep know My voice, and the valley of death
Through which I shall lead them some day;
But no danger nor harm can touch one of them,
For I will be with them alway.

Jesus is my Shepherd, nothing shall I need;
In the green, sweet pastures He doth ever lead,
And beside the waters, crystal, pure, and still,
Yea, to overflowing He my cup doth fill.
Jesus is my Shepherd, He supplies my needs,
In the shining pathway, tenderly He leads;
He protects and shelters in His peaceful fold,
From the many dangers, from the storm and cold.
He doth always lead me in the narrow way,
And my soul restoreth if I go astray;
Though through death’s dark valley I must shortly go,
In His blessed presence I will fear no foe.
He will ever bless me, all my needs supply;
Yea, with richest favors He will satisfy;
In a shining mansion, fitted up for me,
I will live with Jesus through eternity.

My Shepherd fills my every need:
For my soul’s good, He came to bleed.
In pastures green, He makes me lie,
I rest content beneath His eye.
With Him I walk by waters still,
And drink the peace of His sweet will.
My tiring spirit He restores:
His wine of grace from Calv’ry pours.
In righteous paths He leads me on
From wrath’s dark night to mercy’s dawn.
With promise faithful as His name,
He swears His love, always the same.
Death’s mighty shadows cast their pall,
But Jesus vanquishes them all,
No ill can touch, nor evil harm
The treasure kept by God’s own arm.
His rod and staff drive out all fear.
His righteous robes dry every tear.
Before my foes, this bread He breaks,
And of His flesh, my soul partakes.
I smell His oil upon my head
Whose death shall raise me from the dead.
My cup o’er flows with Calv’ry’s wine:
This blood of God makes heaven mine.
Goodness and mercy follow me;
Through all the days my life shall be,
And in God’s house, His praise to tell,
My ransomed soul will ever dwell.

My Shepherd is the Lamb,
The living Lord Who died;
With all things good I ever am
By Him supplied.
He richly feeds my soul
With blessings from above,
And leads me where the rivers roll
Of endless love.
My soul He doth restore
Whene’er I go astray;
He makes my cup of joy run o’er
From day to day;
His love, so full, so free,
Anoints my head with oil;
Mercy and goodness follow me,
Fruit of His toil.
When faith and hope shall cease,
And love abide alone,
Then shall I see Him face to face,
And know as known.
Still shall I lift my voice,
His praise my song shall be;
And I will in His love rejoice
Who died for me.

My Shepherd is the living Lord;
Now shall my wants be well supplied;
His providence and holy Word
Become my safety and my guide.
In pastures where salvation grows
He makes me feed, He makes me rest;
There living water gently flows,
And all the food’s divinely blest.
My wandering feet His ways mistake,
But He restores my soul to peace,
And leads me, for His mercy’s sake,
In the fair paths of righteousness.
Though I walk through the gloomy vale
Where death and all its terrors are,
My heart and hope shall never fail,
For God my Shepherd’s with me there.
Amidst the darkness and the deeps,
Thou art my comfort, Thou my stay;
Thy staff supports my feeble steps,
Thy rod directs my doubtful way.
The sons of earth, and sons of hell,
Gaze at Thy goodness, and repine
To see my table spread so well
With living bread and cheerful wine.
How I rejoice when on my head
Thy Spirit condescends to rest!
’Tis a divine anointing, shed
Like oil of gladness at a feast.
Surely the mercies of the Lord
Attend His household all their days;
There will I dwell to hear His Word,
To seek His face, and sing His praise.

My Shepherd is the Lord my God;
What can I want beside?
He leads me where green pastures are,
And where cool waters hide.
He will refresh my soul again,
When I am faint and sore,
And guide my step for His Name’s sake,
In right paths evermore.
Though I should walk the vale of death,
I should not know a fear.
Thy rod and staff they comfort me:
Thou, Lord, art ever near.
A table Thou hast spread for me
In presence of my foes;
Thou dost anoint my head with oil,
My cup, Lord, overflows.
Thy goodness and Thy mercy, Lord,
Will surely follow me,
And in Thy house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be.
Jehovah is His Name;
in pastures fresh he makes me feed,
beside the living stream.
He brings my wandering spirit back
when I forsake his ways,
and leads me, for his mercy's sake,
in paths of truth and grace.
When I walk through the shades of death
his presence is my stay;
one word of his supporting grace
drives all my fears away.
His hand, in sight of all my foes,
doth still my table spread;
my cup with blessings overflows,
his oil anoints my head.
The sure provisions of my God
attend me all my days;
O may thy house be my abode,
and all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest,
while others go and come;
no more a stranger, nor a guest,
but like a child at home.

Seems I've been waitin' forever for ships to come in
And I've been searchin' for treasure at the rainbows end

Woh oh

My sins have taken such a hold on me,
I am not able to look up to Thee;
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
But Thou hast taken all my sins away,
And I in Thee dare now look up and pray:
Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.
Of nights unhallowed, and of sinful days,
Of careless thoughts and words and works and way,
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
And in the life which doth within me live,
And the forgiveness which can all forgive,
Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.
Of selfishness which makes the soul unjust,
Envy and strife and every sinful lust,
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
And in the blood, which doth my pardon plead,
The truth and love, which for me intercede,
Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.
Of sins that as a cloud have hid Thy face,
Of Thy care slighted, and thy grieved grace,
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
In Love, that puts sin’s envious veil aside,
Rending the veil of flesh which for me died,
Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.
For sin I mourn, the sin that gave Thee pain;
Thine was the burden, mine alone the stain;
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
Christ is my joy; and out of all distress
He doth deliver with His righteousness:
Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.

My sins laid open to the rod,
The back which from the law was free;
And the eternal Son of God
Received the stripes once due to me.
No beam was in His eye, nor mote,
Nor laid to Him was any blame;
And yet His cheeks for me were smote—
The cheeks that never blushed for shame.
I pierced those sacred hands and feet
That never touched or walked in sin;
I broke the heart that only beat
The souls of sinful men to win.
That sponge of vinegar and gall
Was placed by me upon His tongue;
And when derision mocked His call,
I stood that mocking crowd among.
And yet His blood was shed for me,
To be of sin the double cure;
And balm there flows from Calvary’s tree
That heals my guilt and makes me pure.

My sins, my sins, my Savior!
They take such hold on me,
I am not able to look up,
Save only, Christ, on Thee;
In Thee is all forgiveness,
In Thee abundant grace,
My shadow and my sunshine
The brightness of Thy face.
My sins, my sins, my Savior!
Their guilt I never knew
Till with Thee in the desert
I near Thy passion drew;
Till with Thee in the garden
I heard Thy pleading prayer,
And saw the sweat-drops bloody
That told Thy sorrow there.
Therefore my songs, my Savior,
E’en in this time of woe,
Shall tell of all Thy goodness
To suff’ring man below;
Thy goodness and Thy favor,
Whose presence from above
Rejoice those hearts, my Savior,
That live in Thee and love.

My son, know thou the Lord,
Thy father’s God obey;
Seek His protecting care by night,
His guardian hand by day.
Call, while He may be found;
Seek Him while He is near;
Serve Him with all thy heart and mind,
And worship Him with fear.
If Thou wilt seek his face,
His ear will hear Thy cry;
Then shalt Thou find His mercy sure,
His grace forever nigh.
But if thou leave thy God,
Nor choose the path to heaven,
Then shalt thou perish in thy sins,
And never be forgiven.

My song forever shall record
The tender mercies of the Lord;
Thy faithfulness will I proclaim,
And every age shall know Thy Name.
I sing of mercies that endure,
Forever builded firm and sure,
Of faithfulness that never dies,
Established changeless in the skies.
Behold God’s truth and grace displayed,
For He has faithful cov’nant made,
And He has sworn that David’s Son
Shall ever sit upon his throne.
“For him My mercy shall endure,
My cov’nant made with him is sure;
His throne and race I will maintain
Forever, while the heav’ns remain."
The heavens shall join in glad accord
To praise Thy wondrous works, O Lord;
Thy faithfulness shall praise command
Where holy ones assembled stand.
Who in the heavenly dwellings fair
Can with the Lord Himself compare?
Or who among the mighty shares
The likeness that Jehovah bears?
With fear and reverence at His feet
God’s holy ones in council meet;
Yea, more than all about His throne
Must He be feared, and He alone.
O Thou Jehovah, God of hosts,
What mighty one Thy likeness boasts?
In all Thy works and vast designs
Thy faithfulness forever shines.
The swelling sea obeys Thy will,
Its angry waves Thy voice can still;
Thy mighty enemies are slain,
Thy foes resist Thy power in vain.
The heavens and earth, by right divine,
The world and all therein, are Thine;
The whole creation’s wondrous frame
Proclaims its Maker’s glorious Name.
Blest be the Lord forevermore,
Whose promise stands from days of yore,
His Word is faithful now as then;
Blest be His Name.Amen, Amen.

When out on life’s ocean, the waves dashing high,
While waters are troubled, and no help is nigh,
I’ll sing Ebenezer and watch for the light,
“And call to remembrance my song in the night."
“My song in the night, my song in the night;
I call to remembrance my song in the night."
God’s promise is sure, and we’re safe in His care,
He’ll help all His children their burdens to bear;
To Him let us look to be kept in the right,
“And call to remembrance our song in the night."
The blood of the Savior will cleanse every one;
O sinner, He’ll save you if only you’ll come;
Accept of His mercy, your way will be bright,
Then sing with the saved ones your “song in the night."
The home over there will be soon our abode,
Tho’ straight is the way oftentimes rough the road;
But Jesus our Guide is the Way and the Light,
I call to remembrance my song in the night.

My song is love unknown,
My Savior’s love to me;
Love to the loveless shown,
That they might lovely be.
O who am I, that for my sake
My Lord should take, frail flesh and die?
He came from His blest throne
Salvation to bestow;
But men made strange, and none
The longed for Christ would know:
But O! my Friend, my Friend indeed,
Who at my need His life did spend.
Sometimes they strew His way,
And His sweet praises sing;
Resounding all the day
Hosannas to their King:
Then “Crucify!" is all their breath,
And for His death they thirst and cry.
Why, what hath my Lord done?
What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run,
He gave the blind their sight,
Sweet injuries! Yet they at these
Themselves displease, and ’gainst Him rise.
They rise and needs will have
My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they saved,
The Prince of life they slay,
Yet cheerful He to suffering goes,
That He His foes from thence might free.
In life, no house, no home
My Lord on earth might have;
In death no friendly tomb
But what a stranger gave.
What may I say? Heav’n was His home;
But mine the tomb wherein He lay.
Here might I stay and sing,
No story so divine;
Never was love, dear King!
Never was grief like Thine.
This is my Friend, in Whose sweet praise
I all my days could gladly spend.

My song shall be of Jesus;
His mercy crowns my days,
He fills my cup with blessings,
And tunes my heart to praise;
My song shall be of Jesus,
The precious Lamb of God;
Who gave Himself my ransom,
And bought me with His blood.
My song shall be of Jesus;
When, sitting at His feet,
I call to mind His goodness,
In meditation sweet;
My song shall be of Jesus,
Whatever ill betide;
I’ll sing the grace that saves me,
And keeps me at His side.
My song shall be of Jesus,
While pressing on my way
To reach the blissful region
Of pure and perfect day.
And when my soul shall enter
The gate of Eden fair,
A song of praise to Jesus
I’ll sing forever there.

My song shall bless the Lord of all,
My praise shall climb to His abode;
Thee, Savior, by that name I call,
The great Supreme, the mighty God.
Without beginning, or decline,
Object of faith, and not of sense;
Eternal ages saw Him shine,
He shines eternal ages hence.
As much, when in the manger laid,
Almighty Ruler of the sky;
As when the six days’ works He made,
Filled all the morning-stars with joy.
Of all the crowns Jehovah bears,
Salvation is His dearest claim;
That gracious sound well-pleased He hears,
And owns Emmanuel for His name.
A cheerful confidence I feel,
My well-placed hopes with joy I see;
My bosom glows with heav’nly zeal
To worship Him Who died for me.
As man, He pities my complaint,
His pow’r and truth are all divine;
He will not fail, He cannot faint,
Salvation’s sure, and must be mine.

My sorrows like a flood
Impatient of restraint
Into thy bosom, O my God,
Pour out a long complaint
This impious heart of mine
Could once defy the Lord,
Rush with violence on to sin
In presence of thy word
How often have I stood
A rebel to the skies
And yet, and yet, O matchless grace,
Thy thunder lies!
O'ercome by matchless love,
Here at thy cross I lie,
And throw my flesh, my soul, my all,
And weep, and love, and cry.
"Rise," says the Savior, "Rise,
Behold my wounded veins;
Here flows a sacred crimson flood,
To wash away thy stains."
See, Justice satisfied!
Behold God's smiling face!
Let joyful cherubs clap their wings,
And sound aloud his grace.

My soul before Thee prostrate lies;
To Thee, her Source, my spirit flies;
My wants I mourn, my chains I see;
O let Thy presence set me free.
Jesus, vouchsafe my heart and will
With Thy meek lowliness to fill;
No more her power let nature boast,
But in Thy will may mine be lost.
Already springing hope I feel,
God will destroy the power of hell,
And, from a land of wars and pain,
Lead me where peace and safety reign.
One only care my soul shall know,
Father, all Thy commands to do;
And feel, what endless years shall prove,
That Thou, my Lord, my God, art love.

My soul complete in Jesus stands!
It fears no more the law’s demands;
The smile of God is sweet within,
Where all before was guilt and sin.
My soul at rest in Jesus lives:
Accepts the peace His pardon gives;
Receives the grace His death secured,
And pleads the anguish He endured.
My soul its every foe defies,
And cries—’tis God that justifies!
Who charges God’s elect with sin?
Shall Christ, Who died their peace to win?
A song of praise my soul shall sing
To our eternal, glorious King!
Shall worship humbly at His feet,
In Whom alone it stands complete.

My soul for Thy salvation faints,
But still I hope in Thee;
I long to see Thy promised help,
When Thou shalt comfort me.
Thy statutes I do not forget,
Though wasting grief I know;
Thy servant’s days are few, O Lord:
When wilt Thou judge my foe?
The proud, disdainful of Thy law,
Entrap me wrongfully;
O Thou, Whose law is just and true,
Help and deliver me.
Almost consumed, yet from Thy law
I have not turned away;
In lovingkindness give me strength,
That I may still obey.

My soul, how lovely is the place
To which thy God resorts!
’Tis heav’n to see His smiling face,
Though in His earthly courts.
There the great Monarch of the skies
His saving power displays,
And light breaks in upon our eyes
With kind and quick’ning rays.
With His rich gifts the heav’nly Dove
Descends and fills the place,
While Christ reveals His wondrous love,
And sheds abroad His grace.
There, mighty God, Thy words declare
The secrets of Thy will;
And still we seek Thy mercy there,
And sing Thy praises still.
My heart and flesh cry out for Thee,
While far from Thine abode;
When shall I tread Thy courts, and see
My Savior and my God?
The sparrow builds herself a nest,
And suffers no remove;
O make me, like the sparrows, blest,
To dwell but where I love.
To sit one day beneath Thine eye,
And hear Thy gracious voice,
Exceeds a whole eternity
Employed in carnal joys.
Lord, at Thy threshold I would wait
While Jesus is within,
Rather than fill a throne of state,
Or live in tents of sin.
Could I command the spacious land,
And the more boundless sea,
For one blest hour at Thy right hand
I’d give them both away.

My soul in sad exile was out on life’s sea,
So burdened with sin and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice, saying,
“Make Me your choice";
And I entered the “Haven of Rest"!
I’ve anchored my soul in the “Haven of Rest,"
I’ll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep over wild, stormy, deep,
In Jesus I’m safe evermore.
I yielded myself to His tender embrace,
In faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul;
The “Haven of Rest" is my Lord.
The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus, Who’ll save whosoever will have
A home in the “Haven of Rest."
How precious the thought that we all may recline,
Like John, the beloved so blest,
On Jesus’ strong arm, where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the “Haven of Rest."
O come to the Savior, He patiently waits
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul in the “Haven of Rest,"
And say, “My Beloved is mine."

My soul in silence waits for God,
My Savior He has proved;
He only is my Rock and Tower;
I never shall be moved.
My honor is secure with God,
My Savior He is known;
My Refuge and my Rock of strength
Are found in God alone.
My enemies my ruin seek,
They plot with fraud and guile;
Deceitful, they pretend to bless,
But inwardly revile.
My soul in silence waits for God,
He is my help approved;
He only only is my Rock and Tower,
And I shall not be moved.
On Him, ye people, evermore
Rely with confidence;
Before Him pour ye out your heart,
For God is our defense.
For surely men are helpers vain,
The high and the abased;
Yea, lighter than a breath are they
When in the balance placed.
Trust not in harsh oppression’s power
Nor in unrighteous gain;
If wealth increase, yet on your gold
Ye set your hearts in vain.
For God has spoken o’er and o’er,
And unto me has shown,
That saving power and lasting strength
Belong to Him alone.
Yea, lovingkindness evermore
Belongs to Thee, O Lord;
And Thou according to his work
Dost every man reward.

Jesus found me when afar I wandered,
Brought me pardon from the throne above,
Gave me peace that passeth understanding,
Joy unspeakable and full of love.
Praise the Lord! My soul is filled with glory!
Praise the Lord! I love to tell the story
Of His grace that justifies me freely,
And I’m shouting, “Glory!" till I get home.
Thro’ His Word He taught me full salvation—
How His blood could cleanse and sanctify.
Then by faith I plunged into the fountain;
Now I’m looking for that home on high.
Praise the Lord! My soul is filled with glory!
Praise the Lord! I love to tell the story
Of His grace that justifies me wholly,
And I’m shouting, “Glory!" till I get home.
Trials many will beset my pathway,
And temptations I shall surely meet;
But my Savior promised grace to help me
Till I lay my trophies at His feet.
Praise the Lord! My soul is filled with glory!
Praise the Lord! I love to tell the story
Of His grace that keeps and gives me vict’ry,
And I’m shouting, “Glory!" till I get home.

My soul is sad and much dismayed;
See, Lord, what legions of my foes,
With fierce Apollyon at their head,
My heav’nly pilgrimage oppose!
See, from the over-burning lake
How like a smoky cloud they rise!
With horrid blasts my soul they shake,
With storms of blasphemies and lies.
Their fiery arrows reach the mark,
My throbbing heart with anguish tear;
Each lights upon a kindred spark,
And finds abundant fuel there.
I hate the thought that wrongs the Lord;
O, I would drive it from my breast,
With Thy own sharp two-edged sword,
Far as the east is from the west!
Come then, and chase the cruel host,
Heal the deep wounds I have received!
Nor let the pow’rs of darkness boast
That I am foiled, and Thou art grieved!

All this world, its wealth and honor,
Cannot sate the human breast;
But when filled with God, our Father,
Every want is fully blest.
My soul is satisfied,
My soul is satisfied;
I am complete in Jesus love,
And my soul is satisfied.
All my soul can wish forever
I do find in Christ replete;
Every blessing and the Giver
In my peaceful bosom meet.
Is thy life bereft of comfort?
And thy heart a cheerless spot?
Say not Christ is in thy desert—
For we can believe it not.
Can a bird drink up the ocean,
Thirsting still from shore to shore;
Or the God of all creation
Leave thy heart yet craving more? 
Would my soul could more encompass
Heaven’s glory, willed to me;
Oh, the love of God so precious,
’Tis a deep and shoreless sea.

My soul is so happy in Jesus,
For He is so precious to me;
His voice it is music to hear it,
His face it is Heaven to see.
I am happy in Him,
I am happy in Him;
My soul with delight
He fills day and night
For I am happy in Him.
He sought me so long ere I knew Him,
When wand’ring afar from the fold;
Safe home in His arms He hath bro’t me,
To where there are pleasures untold.
His love and His mercy surround me,
His grace like a river doth flow;
His Spirit, to guide and to comfort,
Is with me wherever I go.
They say I shall some day be like Him,
My cross and my burden lay down;
Till then I will ever be faithful,
In gathering gems for His crown.

My soul, now bless thy Maker!
Let all within me bless His name
Who maketh thee partaker
Of mercies more than thou dar'st claim.
Forget Him not whose meekness
Still bears with all thy sin,
Who healeth all thy weakness,
Renews thy life within;
Whose grace and care are endless
And saved thee through the past;
Who leaves no sufferer friendless,
But rights the wronged at last.
He shows to man His treasure
Of judgment, truth, and righteousness,
His love beyond all measure,
His yearning pity o'er distress,
Nor treats us as we merit,
But lays His anger by,
The humble, contrite spirit
Finds His compassion nigh;
And high as heaven above us,
As break from close of day,
So far, since He doth love us,
He puts our sins away.
For as a tender father
Hath pity on his children here,
He in His arms will gather
All who are His in childlike fear.
He knows how frail our powers
Who but from dust are made;
We flourish like the fowers,
And even so we fade;
The wind but o'er them passes,
And all their bloom is o'er,
We wither like the grasses,
Our place knows us no more.
God's grace alone endureth,
And children's children yet shall prove
How He with strength assureth
The hearts of all that seek His love.
In heaven is fixed His dwelling,
His rule is over all;
Angels, in might excelling,
Bright hosts, before Him fall.
Praise Him, who ever reigneth,
All ye who hear His Word,
Nor our poor hymns disdaineth
My soul, oh, bless the Lord! 

My soul once had its plenteous years,
And throve, with peace and comfort filled,
Like the fat kine and ripened ears,
Which Pharaoh in his dream beheld.
With pleasing frames and grace received,
With means and ordinances fed;
How happy for a while I lived,
And little feared the want of bread.
But famine came and left no sign
Of all the plenty I had seen;
Like the dry ears and half-starved kine,
I then looked withered, faint and lean.
To Joseph the Egyptians went,
To Jesus I made known my case;
He, when my little stock was spent,
Opened His magazine of grace.
For He the time of dearth foresaw,
And made provision long before;
That famished souls, like me, might draw
Supplies from His unbounded store.
Now on His bounty I depend,
And live from fear of dearth secure,
Maintained by such a mighty Friend,
I cannot want till He is poor.
O sinners, hear His gracious call!
His mercy’s door stands open wide,
He has enough to feed you all,
And none who come shall be denied.

My soul today is thirsting for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest Heaven to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, in Jesus’ Name I plead;
O send the gracious current to satisfy my need.
Like a mighty sea, like a mighty sea,
Comes the love of Jesus sweeping over me;
The waves of glory roll, the shouts I can’t control;
Comes the love Jesus sweeping o’er my soul.
I see the clouds arising, the mercy clouds of love,
That come to bring refreshing down from the throne above,
The earnest of the shower, just now to us is giv’n,
And now we wait, expecting the floods of grace from Heav’n.
The show’rs of grace are falling, the tide is rolling in,
The floodtide of salvation, with power to cleanse from sin;
It’s surging through my being and takes my sin away,
It keeps me shouting glory! through all the happy day.
It’s coming, yes, it’s coming, it’s coming down this hour,
A torrent of salvation in saving, cleansing power:
I hear the billows surging, I see them mount and roll;
O glory, hallelujah! they’re sweeping through my soul.

My soul with expectation doth
Depend on God indeed;
My strength and my salvation do
From Him alone proceed.
He only my Salvation is,
And my strong Rock is He;
He only is my sure Defense;
I shall not moved be.
In God my glory placed is,
And my salvation sure;
In God the Rock is of my strength;
My Refuge most secure.
Ye people, place your confidence
In Him continually;
Before Him pour ye out your heart;
God is our Refuge high.

My soul with patience waits
for thee, the living Lord:
my hopes are on thy promise built,
thy never-failing word.
My longing eyes look out
for thy enlivening ray,
more duly than the morning watch
to spy the dawning day.
Let Israel trust in God;
no bounds his mercy knows;
the plenteous source and spring from whence
eternal succor flows.

My soul with rapture waits for thee,
Beautiful vale of rest;
My home beyond the rolling sea,
Beautiful vale of rest;
I long to sing thy pleasures o’er,
The glories of thy tranquil shore,
Where pain and sorrow come no more—
Happy vale of rest.
Beautiful vale of rest,
Beautiful vale of rest,
My soul with rapture longs for thee,
O! lovely vale of rest.
Thy radiant fields and glowing skies,
Beautiful vale of rest;
Too pure and bright for mortal eyes,
Beautiful vale of rest;
Beside the living stream that flows,
The weary heart shall find repose—
Thy pearly gates shall never close,
Happy vale of rest.
The joys of earth, how soon they fade!
Beautiful vale of rest;
Like morning dew or evening shade,
Beautiful vale of rest;
Yet, when we reach thy golden strand,
Our gentle Savior’s promised land,
We’ll sing with all the angel band,
Happy vale of rest.
O! who would dwell forever here,
Beautiful vale of rest;
With joy, unfading joy so near,
Beautiful vale of rest;
O! may I live that I may wear
A starry crown forever there,
And breathe thy sweet and balmy air,
Happy vale of rest.

Oh Lord, my heart is not proud nor my eye lifted up
I don't involve myself in things too great or difficult
Like a weaned child at its mother's breast
My soul with You finds comfort and rest
My soul with You finds comfort and rest
Oh Lord, I hunger and thirst, feel so weary and worn
Tired from traveling many miles battered by the storms
As a baby lamb longs for pastures green
Close to my Shepherd I want to be
Close to my Shepherd I want to be
(
Praise 

My soul, be on thy guard;
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.
O watch, and fight, and pray;
The battle ne’er give o’er;
Renew it boldly every day,
And help divine implore.
Never think the victory won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
The work of faith will not be done,
Till thou obtain the crown.
Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He’ll take thee, at thy parting breath,
To His divine abode.

My soul, bless the Lord! the Lord is most great,
With glory arrayed, majestic His state;
The light is His garment, the skies are his shade,
And over the waters His courts has He laid.
He rides on the clouds, the wings of the storm,
The lightning and wind His mission perform;
The earth He has founded her station to keep,
And wrapped as a vesture about her the deep.
O’er mountain and plain the dark waters raged;
His voice they obeyed, the floods were assuaged;
Uplifting the mountains He ordered a bound,
Forbidding the waters to cover the ground.
He causes the springs of water to flow
In streams ’mid the hills and valleys below;
Beside them with singing the birds greet the day,
And there the beasts gather their thirst to allay.
He waters the hills with rain from the skies,
And plentiful grass and herbs He supplies,
Supplying the cattle, and blessing man’s toil
With bread in abundance, with wine and with oil.
The trees which the Lord has planted are fed,
And over the earth their branches are spread;
They keep in their shelter the birds of the air,
The life of each creature the Lord makes His care.
Thy Spirit, O Lord, makes life to abound,
The earth is renewed, and fruitful the ground;
To God ascribe glory and wisdom and might,
Let God in His creatures forever delight.
Rejoicing in God, my thought shall be sweet,
While sinners depart in ruin complete;
My soul, bless Jehovah, His Name be adored,
Come, praise Him, ye people, and worship the Lord.

My soul, inspired with sacred love,
The Lord thy God delight to praise;
His gifts I will for Him improve,
To Him devote my happy days;
To Him my thanks and praises give,
And only for His glory live.
Long as my God shall lend me breath,
My every pulse shall beat for Him;
And when my voice is lost in death,
My spirit shall resume the theme.
The gracious theme, for ever new,
Through all eternity pursue.
Soon as the breath of man expires,
Again he to his earth shall turn;
Where then are all his vain desires,
His love and hate, esteem and scorn?
All, all at that last gasp are o’er,
He falls to rise on earth no more.
He, then, is blest, and only he,
Whose hope is in the Lord his God,
Who can to Him for succor flee,
That spread the earth and Heaven abroad;
That still the universe sustains,
And Lord of His creation reigns.
True to His everlasting Word,
He loves the injured to redress:
Poor helpless souls the bounteous Lord
Relieves, and fills with plenteousness:
He sets the mournful prisoners free,
He bids the blind their Savior see.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, reigns,
Supreme in mercy as in power,
The endless theme of heavenly strains,
When time and death shall be no more:
And all eternity shall prove
Too short to utter all His love.

My soul, now praise thy Maker!
Let all within me bless His Name
Who maketh thee partaker
Of mercies more than thou dar’st claim.
Forget Him not Whose meekness
Still bears with all thy sin,
Who healeth all thy weakness,
Renews thy life within.
Whose grace and care are endless
And saved thee thro’ the past;
Who leaves no suff’rer friendless,
But rights the wronged at last.
He shows to man His treasure
Of judgment, truth, and righteousness,
His love beyond all measure,
His yearning pity o’er distress,
Nor treats us as we merit,
But lays His anger by.
The humble, contrite spirit
Finds His compassion nigh;
And high as Heav’n above us,
As break from close of day,
So far, since He doth love us,
He puts our sins away.
For as a tender father
Hath pity on his children here,
He in His arms will gather
All who are His in childlike fear.
He knows how frail our powers
Who but from dust are made;
We flourish like the flowers,
And even so we fade;
The wind but o’er them passes,
And all their bloom is o’er—
We wither like the grasses,
Our place knows us no more.
God’s grace alone endureth,
And children’s children yet shall prove
How He with strength assureth
The hearts of all that seek His love.
In Heav’n is fixed His dwelling,
His rule is over all;
Angels, in might excelling,
Bright hosts, before Him fall.
Praise Him Who ever reigneth,
All ye who hear His Word,
Nor our poor hymns disdaineth—
My soul, O praise the Lord!

My soul, Whose mercies are so great;
Whose anger is so slow to rise,
So ready to abate.
God will not always chide;
And when His strokes are felt,
His strokes are fewer than our crimes,
And lighter than our guilt.
High as the heav’ns are raised,
Above the ground we tread,
So far the riches of His grace
Our highest thoughts exceed.
His power subdues our sins;
And His forgiving love
Far as the east is from the west,
Doth all our guilt remove.
The pity of the Lord,
To those that fear His Name,
Is such as tender parents feel;
He knows our feeble frame.
Our days as are the grass,
Or like the morning flower;
If one sharp blast sweep o’er the field
It withers in an hour.
But Thy compassions, Lord,
To endless years endure;
And children’s children ever find
Thy words of promise sure.

My soul, there is a country,
Afar beyond the stars,
Where stands a winged sentry,
All skillful in the wars.
There, above noise and danger,
Sweet Peace sits crowned with smiles,
And One born in a manger
Commands the beauteous files.
He is thy gracious Friend
And (O my soul, awake!)
Did in pure love descend,
To die here for thy sake.
If thou canst get but thither,
There grows the flower of peace,
The rose that cannot wither,
Thy fortress, and thy ease.
Leave, then, thy foolish ranges;
For none can thee secure
But One, Who never changes,
Thy God, thy Life, thy Cure.

My soul’s best Friend, what joy and blessing
My spirit ever finds in Thee!
From gloomy depths of doubt distressing
Into Thine arms for rest I flee.
There will the night of sorrow vanish
When from my heart Thy love doth banish.
All anguish and all pain and fear.
Yea, here on earth begins my heaven;
Who would not joyful be when given
A loving Savior always near!
For though the evil world revile me
And prove herself my bitter foe
Or by her smile seek to beguile me,
I trust her not; her wiles I know.
In Thee alone my soul rejoices,
Thy praise alone it gladly voices,
For Thou art true when friendships flee.
The world may hate but cannot fell me;
Would mighty waves of trial quell me
I anchor in Thy loyalty.
Thro’ deserts of the cross Thou leadest;
I follow, leaning on Thy hand.
From out the cloud Thy child Thou feedest
And givest water from the sand.
I trust Thy ways, howe’er distressing;
For I know my path will end in blessing;
Enough that Thou wilt be my Stay.
For whom to honor Thou intendest
Oft into sorrow’s vale Thou sendest;
The night must e’er precede the day.
My soul’s best Friend, how well contented
Am I, reposing on Thy breast;
By sin no more am I tormented
Since Thou dost grant me peace and rest.
Oh, may the grace that Thou has given
For me a foretaste be of Heaven,
Where I shall bask in joys divine!
Away, vain world, with fleeting pleasures;
In Christ I have abiding treasures.
O, comfort sweet, my Friend is mine!

My span of life will soon be done,
The passing moments say;
As lengthening shadows o’er the mead
Proclaim the close of day.
O that my heart might dwell aloof
From all created things,
And learn that wisdom from above
Whence true contentment springs!
Courage, my soul! thy bitter cross,
In every trial here,
Shall bear thee to thy heaven above,
But shall not enter there.
Courage, my soul, on God rely;
Deliverance soon will come;
A thousand ways has Providence
To bring believers home.

My spirit longs for Thee,
Within my troubled breast,
Though I unworthy be
Of so divine a Guest.
Of so divine a Guest
Unworthy though I be,
Yet has my heart no rest
Unless it come from Thee.
Unless it come from thee,
In vain I look around;
In all that I can see
No rest is to be found.
No rest is to be found
But in Thy blessed love;
O let my wish be crowned
And send it from above.

My steadfast heart, O God,
Will sound Thy praise abroad
With tuneful string;
The dawn shall hear my song,
Thy praise I will prolong,
And where Thy people throng
Thanksgiving bring.
Thy truth and tender love
Are high as Heav’n above;
Thy help we crave.
Be Thou exalted high
Above the lofty sky;
Lest Thy beloved die,
O hear and save.
God’s Word shall surely stand;
His Name through every land
Shall be adored;
Lord, who shall lead our host?
Thine aid we covet most,
In Thee is all our boast,
Strong in the Lord.

My stubborn will at last hath yielded;
I would be Thine, and Thine alone;
And this the prayer my lips are bringing,
Lord, let in me Thy will be done.
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer;
Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee.
I’m tired of sin, footsore and weary,
The darksome path hath dreary grown,
But now a light has ris’n to cheer me;
I find in Thee my Star, my Sun.
Thy precious will, O conqu’ring Savior,
Doth now embrace and compass me;
All discords hushed, my peace a river,
My soul, a prisoned bird, set free.
Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever,
My wayward feet no more to roam;
What pow’r from Thee my soul can sever?
The center of God’s will my home.

I have given up all to my Savior so dear,
And His praises I ever will sing;
And though all of this world should forsake me while here,
To my Savior I ever will cling.
He leads me each day in the heavenly way,
So onward and upward I’ll climb;
In the straight, narrow way, I’m determined to stay,
Till I leave this old dark world behind.
I’ve received such great light, and its beams are so bright,
That the past of my life’s way seems dim;
I will walk in this light by day and by night,
Still closer I’ll cling unto Him.
Some think I’ve done wrong by leaving the throng,
Who abide in sectarian strife;
But I’ve only come back where God’s people belong,
From Babel I fled for my life.
I have a good home in the fold of my Lord,
Where His sanctified children all dwell;
I am glad that I heard the truth from His word,
And now with my soul all is well.
Someday when my life and its labors are o’er,
And my sheaves at His feet I lay down,
I will meet all the saints on that beautiful shore,
And receive a bright, glittering crown.

My times are in Thy hand;
My God, I wish them there;
My life, my friends, my soul I leave
Entirely to Thy care.
My times are in Thy hand;
Whatever they may be;
Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.
My times are in Thy hand;
Why should I doubt or fear?
My Father’s hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.
My times are in Thy hand,
Jesus, the crucified!
Those hands my cruel sins had pierced
Are now my guard and guide.
My times are in Thy hand,
I’ll always trust in Thee;
And, after death, at Thy right hand
I shall forever be.

My times of sorrow and of joy,
Great God, are in Thy hand.
My choicest comforts come from Thee,
And go at Thy command.
If Thou shouldst take them all away,
Yet would I not repine;
Before they were possessed by me,
They were entirely Thine.
Nor would I drop a murmuring word,
Though the whole world were gone,
But seek enduring happiness
In Thee, and Thee alone.
What is the world with all its store?
’Tis but a bitter sweet;
When I attempt to pluck the rose
A pricking thorn I meet.
Here perfect bliss can ne’er be found,
The honey’s mixed with gall;
Midst changing scenes and dying friends,
Be Thou my all in all

I do not ask to live a life of ease,
I do not ask for wealth or honor,
I do not ask to do as I would please;
I only ask that when I die
My title may be clear to reign on high.
My title clear, no questions left behind,
A blameless record, strong and certain,
That Thou and all who look no dispute find;
Yes, Lord, I ask that when I die
My title may be clear to reign on high.
I do not ask for things too high for me,
I do not ask to know the morrow,
I do not ask that myst’ries I may see;
I only ask that when I die
My title may be clear to reign on high.
I only ask—this is my only plea,
I ask for grace to be a Christian,
To live a life of constant victory;
And this I ask that when I die
My title may be clear to reign on high.
When shadows lengthen on my pathway here,
When evening shades would dim my vision,
I ask for help that I may persevere;
And this I ask that when I die
My title may be clear to reign on high.

How can I say thanks
For the things You have done for me,
Things so undeserved,
Yet You gave to prove Your love for me.
The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude.
All that I am and ever hope to be,
I owe it all to Thee.
To God be the glory,
To God be the glory,
To God be the glory,
For the things He has done.
With His blood He has saved me,
With His power He has raised me,
To God be the glory,
For the things He has done.
Just let me live my life,
Let it be pleasing, Lord, to Thee,
And if I gain any praise,
Let it go to Calvary.
With His blood He has saved me,
With His power He has raised me,
To God be the glory,
For the things He has done.

My trust is in my heavenly Friend,
My hope in Thee, my God;
Rise and my helpless life defend
From those that seek my blood.
With insolence and fury they
My soul in pieces tear,
As hungry lions rend the prey
When no deliverer’s near.
If I had e’er provoked them first,
Or once abused my foe,
Then let him tread my life to dust,
And lay mine honor low.
If there be malice found in me,
I know Thy piercing eyes;
I should not dare appeal to Thee,
Nor ask my God to rise.
Arise, my God, lift up Thy hand,
Their pride and power control;
Awake to judgment and command
Deliverance for my soul.
Let sinners and their wicked rage
Be humbled to the dust;
Shall not the God of truth engage
To vindicate the just?
He knows the heart, He tries the reins,
He will defend th’upright:
His sharpest arrows He ordains
Against the sons of spite.
For me their malice digged a pit,
But there themselves are cast;
My God makes all their mischief light
On their own heads at last.
That cruel persecuting race
Must feel His dreadful sword;
Awake, my soul, and praise the grace
And justice of the Lord.

My trust is in the Lord:
How say ye then to me,
“Now, like a bird from peril haste,
And to your mountain flee"?
Lo, sinners bend the bow
With arrow fixed for flight;
And stealthily in darkness go
The true in heart to smite.
What can the righteous do,
What can for them avail,
When all foundations are destroyed,
And all the pillars fail?
The Lord in Zion dwells,
The Lord is throned on high;
His eyes behold the sons of men
Their hearts and way to try.
The Lord the righteous proves;
But those who scorn the right,
Who love deceit and violence
Are hateful in His sight.
For righteous is the Lord,
He loveth righteousness,
And with a gracious countenance
The upright He will bless.

I found such a wonderful Savior
In Jesus, my Lord and my King!
Undying and true His devotion;
My heart shall his glad praises sing.
Oh, what a wonderful Savior is He!
Constant and true is Jesus.
More than I fancied He ever could be
Is Jesus, my wonderful Friend.
Surpassing the love that a mother
May have for the child of her care;
The love of a sister or brother
With His we can never compare.
The pleasures the world could afford me
Are naught to compare with His joy;
The rapture and peace that He gives me,
Earth’s sorrows can never destroy.
When sorrows and pain are my portion,
When tears of bereavement must fall,
My Savior, my Friend, my Companion,
Will comfort and keep through it all.
When tempests around me are sweeping,
My Pilot and Guide He will be;
And safe is my soul in His keeping,
My mighty Deliv’rer is he.

Mysterious Presence, Source of all—
The world without, the soul within,
Fountain of life, O hear our call,
And pour Thy living waters in!
Thou breathest in the rushing wind;
Thy Spirit stirs in leaf and flower;
Nor wilt Thou from the willing mind
Withhold Thy light and love and power.
Thy hand unseen to accents clear
Awoke the psalmist’s trembling lyre,
And touched the lip of holy seer
With flame from Thine own altar fire.
That touch divine, still, Lord, impart;
Still give the prophet’s burning word;
And, vocal in each waiting heart,
Let living psalms of praise be heard.

Who among the gods is like You, oh Lord?
Mysterium tremendum
You stretched out Your right hand and the earth swallowed them
Mysterium tremendum
In Your unfailing love
You will lead the people You have redeemed
Mysterium tremendum
In Your strength You will guide them to Your holy dwelling
Mysterium tremendum
The nations will hear and tremble
Mysterium tremendum
By the power of Your arm they will be as still as a stone 
The Lord will reign (The Lord will reign) (The Lord will reign, will reign, the 
Lord will reign)
The Lord will reign (The Lord will reign) (The Lord will reign, will reign, the 
Lord will reign)
The Lord will reign (The Lord will reign) (The Lord will reign, will reign, the 
Lord will reign)
The Lord (the Lord) will reign (will reign) forever
Forever and ever (Mysterium tremendum) 

The man who once has found abode
Within the secret place of God,
Shall with Almighty God abide,
And in His shadow safely hide.
I of the Lord my God will say,
“He is my Refuge and my Stay;
To Him for safety I will flee;
My God, in Him my trust will be."
He shall with all protecting care
Preserve thee from the fowler’s snare;
When fearful plagues around prevail,
No fatal stroke shall thee assail.
His outspread pinions shall thee hide;
Beneath His wings shalt thou confide;
His faithfulness shall ever be
A shield and buckler unto thee.
No nightly terrors shall alarm;
No deadly shaft by day shall harm;
Nor pestilence that walks by night,
Nor plagues that waste in noonday light.
Because thy trust is God alone,
Thy dwelling place the Highest One,
No evil shall upon thee come,
Nor plague approach thy guarded home.
At thy right hand, though thousands die,
No harm shall unto thee come nigh;
But thou, secure, unharmed, shalt see
What wicked men’s reward shall be.

The Master comes! He calls for thee—
Go forth at His almighty word,
Obedient to His last command,
And tell to those who never heard,
Who sit in deepest shades of night,
That Christ has come to give them light.
The Master calls! Arise and go;
How blest His messenger to be!
He, Who hath given thee liberty,
Now bids thee set the captives free;
Proclaim His mighty power to save,
Who for the world His lifeblood gave.
The Master calls! Shall not thy heart
In warm responsive love reply,
“Lord, here am I; send me, send me,
Thy willing slave, to live or die—
An instrument unfit indeed,
Yet Thou wilt give me what I need"?
And if thou canst not go, yet bring
An offering of a willing heart;
Then, though thou tarriest at home,
Thy God shall give thee too thy part;
The messengers of peace upbear
In ceaseless and prevailing prayer.
Short is the time for service true,
For soon shall dawn that glorious day
When, all the harvest gathered in,
Each faithful heart shall hear Him say,
“My child, well done! your toil is o’er—
Enter My joy forevermore."

The Master hath come, and He calls us to follow
The track of the footprints He leaves on our way;
Far over the mountain and through the deep hollow,
The path leads us on to the mansions of day:
The Master hath called us, the children who fear Him,
Who march ’neath Christ’s banner, His own little band;
We love Him and seek Him, we long to be near Him,
And rest in the light of His beautiful land.
The Master hath called us; the road may be dreary
And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;
But God’s Holy Spirit shall comfort the weary;
We follow the Savior and cannot turn back;
The Master hath called us, though doubt and temptation
May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing:
“Press onward, look upward," through much tribulation;
The children of Zion must follow the King.
The Master hath called us, in life’s early morning,
With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:
We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning,
To cast in our lot with the people of God:
The Master hath called us, His sons and His daughters,
We plead for His blessing and trust in His love;
And through the green pastures, beside the still waters,
He’ll lead us at last to His kingdom above.

In the still air the music lies unheard;
In the rough marble beauty hides unseen.
To make the music and the beauty needs
The Master’s touch, the Sculptor’s chisel keen.
Great Master, touch us with Thy skillful hands;
Let not the music that is in us die;
Great Sculptor, hew and polish us, nor let
Hidden and lost, Thy form within us lie.
Spare not the stroke; do with us what Thou wilt;
Let there be naught unfinished, broken, marred;
Complete Thy purpose that we may become
Thy perfect image—Thou our God and Lord.

The Master is come, and calleth for thee,
He stands at the door of thy heart,
No friend so forgiving, so gentle as He,
Oh, say, wilt thou let Him depart?
Patiently waiting, earnestly pleading,
Jesus, thy Savior, knocks at thy heart,
Patiently waiting, earnestly pleading,
Jesus, thy Savior, knocks at thy heart.
The Master has come, with blessings for thee,
Arise, and His message receive;
Thy ransom is purchased, thy pardon is free,
If thou wilt repent and believe.
The Master has come, and calleth thee now,
This moment what joy may be thine;
How tender that smile that illumines His brow,
A pledge of His favor divine.
He waits for thee still, then haste with delight,
Oh, fly to the arms of His love;
Press on to that beautiful mansion of light,
Prepared in His kingdom above.

The mercy of God is an ocean divine,
A boundless and fathomless flood.
Launch out in the deep, cut away the shore line,
And be lost in the fullness of God.
Launch out, into the deep.
Oh let the shore line go.
Launch out, launch out in the ocean divine,
Out where the full tides flow.
But many, alas! only stand on the shore,
And gaze on the ocean so wide.
They never have ventured its depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.
And others just venture away from the land,
And linger so near to the shore
That the surf and the slime that beat over the strand
Dash o’er them in floods evermore.
Oh, let us launch out on this ocean so broad,
Where floods of salvation o’erflow.
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know.

The merits of the saints,
Blessed for evermore,
Their love that never faints,
The toils they bravely bore—
For these the Church today
Pours forth her joyous lay—
These victors win the noblest bay.
They, whom the world of ill,
While it yet held, abhorred;
Its withering flowers that still
They spurned with one accord—
They knew them short lived all,
And followed at Thy call,
King Jesu, to Thy heavenly hall.
Like sheep their blood they poured,
And without groan or tear,
They bent before the sword,
For that their King most dear:
Their souls, serenely blest,
In patience they possessed,
And looked in hope towards their rest.
What tongue may here declare,
Fancy or thought descry,
The joys Thou dost prepare
For these Thy saints on high!
Empurpled in the flood
Of their victorious blood,
They won the laurel from their God.
To Thee, O Lord most high,
One in three Persons still,
To pardon us we cry,
And to preserve from ill:
Here give Thy servants peace,
Hereafter glad release,
And pleasures that shall never cease.

We’re looking for His coming, in the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, when midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ on His throne.
Gladly may we herald the message of His blessed appearing,
Soon He’s coming in glory, tell to one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord,
Why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.
We’re longing for the glory that awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome, and ev’ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.
We’re praying for the advent of our blessed Savior,
Who has promised life to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, the message being given,
And soon we’ll see our Lord face to face.
We see the signs appearing of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves now becoming green;
The Gospel of His kingdom has gone to every nation;
That we are near the end can be seen.

The mighty God, the Lord, hath spoken unto all;
From rising to the setting sun, He unto earth doth call.
From Zion, His own hill, where perfect beauty dwells,
Jehovah hath His glory shown, in brightness that excels.
Our God shall surely come, and silence shall not keep;
Before Him fire shall waste, and storms tempestuous round Him sweep.
He to the heav’ns above shall then send forth His call,
And likewise to the earth that He may judge His people all.
“Together let My saints unto Me gathered be,
Those that by sacrifice have made a covenant with Me."
Then shall the heav’ns declare His righteousness abroad;
Because the Lord Himself is Judge, yea, none is judge, but God.

Ye Christian men of every nation,
Hark, hark what cries salute your ears!
The heathen in their degradation
They call for help with sighs and tears,
They call for help with sighs and tears;
Shall souls immortal languish bleeding?
Oppressed by Satan’s slavish chains,
In superstition’s woes and pains,
While Christian hearts are dead, unheeding?
Arise, O Church of God!
Awake for Jesus’ sake!
March on, march on, all hearts aflame,
For Christ the world to take.
By thousands, hopeless, they are falling,
And ne’er have heard their Savior’s Name;
For life and liberty they’re calling,
But perish in their guilt and shame,
But perish in their guilt and shame;
Too long have Christians heard their wailing,
Their death cries out of pagan night;
Their prayers in vain for Gospel light;
Oh, shall their cries be unavailing?
Oh, ye who serve the King of glory,
In lands where heaven’s blessings glow,
Can ye withhold salvation’s story,
From myriads sunk in heathen woe?
From myriads sunk in heathen woe?
Nay, by the blood that makes men brothers,
The bannered cross must be unfurled;
The kingdom is for all the world,
And men redeemed must uplift others.
Shall Christians hoard their golden treasure?
And pile their stores with miser’s greed,
Or spend for fashion, pride and pleasures,
While empires for the Gospel plead?
While empires for the Gospel plead?
Can men of soul, their God adoring,
For heaven’s crowning glories hope?
While millions in their blindness grope,
And die, the light of life imploring?
See, heaven lends cooperation!
For conquests grand and manifold;
And calls the Church to consecration,
Of life and strength and precious gold;
Of life and strength and precious gold;
While with God’s power the world is shaking,
O’erturning systems, creeds and caste,
And working changes worldwide vast,
’Tis time dead Christian souls were waking.

The mistakes of my life have been many,
The sins of my heart have been more,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But I’ll knock at the open door.
I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But when the dear Savior shall bid me come in,
I’ll enter the open door.
I am lowest of those who love Him,
I am weakest of those who pray;
But I come as He has bidden,
And He will not say me nay.
My mistakes His free grace will cover,
My sins He will wash away,
And the feet that can shrink and falter
Shall walk thro’ the gates of day.
The mistakes of my life have been many,
And my spirit is sick with sin,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But the Savior will let me in.

The moon shines bright and the stars give a light
A little before the day:
Our mighty Lord He looked on us,
And bade us awake and pray.
Awake, awake, good people all,
Awake, and you shall hear,
The Lord our God died on the cross
For us He loved so dear.
O fair, O fair Jerusalem,
When shall I come to thee?
When shall my sorrows have an end,
Thy joy that I may see?
The fields were green as green could be,
When from His glorious seat,
Our blessed Father watered us,
With His heavenly dew so sweet.
And for the saving of our souls
Christ died upon the cross;
We ne’er shall do for Jesus Christ
As He hath done for us.
The life of man is but a span,
And cut down in its flower,
We’re here today, tomorrow gone,
The creatures of an hour.
Instruct and teach your children well,
The while that you are here;
It will be better for your soul,
When your corpse lies on the bier.
Today you may be alive and well,
Worth many a thousand pound;
Tomorrow dead and cold as clay,
Your corpse laid underground.
With one turf at thine head, O man,
And another at thy feet;
Thy good deeds and thy bad, O man,
Will altogether meet.
My song is done, I must be gone,
I can stay no longer here;
God bless you all, both great and small,
And send you a joyful new year!

Oh, rally round the standard
Of Christ, our royal King;
Oh, rally round His standard,
And hallelujahs sing.
For the morning draweth nigh,
For the morning draweth nigh;
We can see it in the distance,
We shall hear it, we shall hear it by and by.
Though long and deep the shadows
The dreary night may bring,
Our lamps are trimmed and burning,
Our hallelujahs ring.
To yonder golden region
Our faith now plumes her wing;
Our hearts with joy are bounding,
And hallelujahs ring.
To Him Who paid our ransom,
And took from death the sting,
Be everlasting praises,
Let hallelujahs ring.

The morning kindles all the sky,
The heavens resound with anthems high,
The shining angels as they speed,
Proclaim, “The Lord is risen indeed!"
Vainly with rocks His tomb was barred,
While Roman guards kept watch and ward;
Majestic from the spoiled tomb,
In pomp of triumph, He has come!
When the amazed disciples heard,
Their hearts with speechless joy were stirred;
Their Lord’s beloved face to see,
Eager they haste to Galilee.
His pierced hands to them He shows,
His face with love’s own radiance glows;
They with the angels’ message speed,
And shout, “The Lord is risen indeed!"
O Christ, thou King compassionate!
Our hearts possess, on Thee we wait:
Help us to render praises due,
To Thee the endless ages through!

O how light to the soul are its crosses,
And how easy our burdens to bear,
When we think of that land over Jordan,
And the joy that will crown us there.
O the bright morning land, the dear morning land,
The land where all sorrow is o’er!
We shall sit beneath the ray of a golden summer day,
Where the shadows will return no more.
O how light to the soul are its crosses,
And the conflicts and trials we meet;
We shall soon lay down them over Jordan,
We shall lay them at Jesus’ feet.
O how light to the soul are its crosses,
O the mercy of Jesus, our Friend!
We shall praise Him for all over Jordan,
In our beautiful home beyond.

The morning light is breaking, the darkness disappears;
The sons of earth are waking, to penitential tears;
Each breeze that sweeps the ocean brings tidings from afar
Of nations in commotion, prepared for Zion’s war.
Rich dews of grace come o’er us, in many a gentle shower,
And brighter scenes before us, are opening every hour;
Each cry to heaven going, abundant answers brings,
And heavenly winds are blowing, with peace upon their wings.
See heathen nations bending before the God we love,
And thousand hearts ascending in gratitude above:
While sinners, now confessing, the Gospel call obey,
And seek the Savior’s blessing, a nation in a day.
Blest river of salvation, pursue thy onward way;
Flow thou to every nation, nor in thy riches stay:
Stay not till all the lowly triumphant reach their home;
Stay not till all the holy proclaim, “The Lord is come."

The morning purples all the sky,
The air with praises rings,
Defeated hell stands sullen by,
The world exulting sings.
Glory to God! our glad lips cry;
All praise and worship be
On earth, in heaven, to God most high,
For Christ’s great victory,
For Christ’s great victory.
While He, the King all strong to save,
Rends the dark doors away,
And through the breaches of the grave,
Strides forth into the day.
Death’s captive, in his gloomy prison,
Fast fettered He has lain,
But He has mastered death, is risen,
And death now wears the chain.
The shining angels cry, “Away
With grief; no spices bring;
Not tears, but songs, this joyful day,
Should greet the rising King!"
That Thou our Paschal Lamb may’st be,
And endless joy begin.
Jesus, Deliverer, set us free
From the dread death of sin.

The mouth of fools doth God confess,
But while their lips draw nigh Him,
Their heart is full of wickedness,
And all their deeds deny Him.
Corrupt are they, and every one
Abominable works hath done;
There is not one well-doer.
The Lord looked from His heavenly throne
On all mankind below Him
To see if there were any one
Who truly sought to know Him,
And all his understanding bent
To search His holy Word, intent
To do His will in earnest.
But none there was who walked with God,
For all aside had slidden,
Delusive paths of folly trod,
And followed lusts forbidden;
Not one there was who practiced good,
Though many deemed, in haughty mood,
Their deeds to God were pleasing.
“How long, by folly blindly led,
Will they oppress the needy
And My own flock devour like bread?"
So fierce are they and greedy!
In God they put no trust at all,
Nor on His Name in trouble call,
But be their own providers.
Therefore their heart is never still,
A constant fear dismays them,
God is with him who doth His will,
Who trusts Him and obeys Him;
Ye shame the counsel of the poor
And mock him when he doth assure
That God is e’er his Refuge.
Who shall to Israel’s outcast race
From Zion bring salvation?
God will Himself at length show grace
And loose the captive nation;
That will He do by Christ, their King;
Let Jacob then be glad and sing
And Israel be joyful.

I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord:
This was freely given, and I found
That He always kept His word.
There’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
And the white robed angels sing the story,
“A sinner has come home."
For there’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
With my sins forgiven I am bound for Heaven,
Never more to roam.
I was humbly kneeling at the cross,
Fearing naught by God’s angry frown;
When the heavens opened and I saw
That my name was written down.
In the Book ’tis written, “Saved by Grace,"
O the joy that came to my soul!
Now I am forgiven, and I know
By the blood I am made whole.

The nails in Your hands
The nail in Your feet
They tell me how much You love me
The thorns on Your brow
They tell me how
You bore so much shame to love me
And when the heavens pass away
All Your scars will still remain
And forever they will say
How much You love me
And I want to say 
Forever my love
Forever my heart
Forever my life, it's Yours
It's Yours

There was One Who was willing to die in my stead,
That a soul so unworthy might live;
And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,
All the sins of my life to forgive.
They are nailed to the cross,
They are nailed to the cross,
O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.
He is tender and loving and patient with me,
While He cleanses my heart of the dross;
But “there’s no condemnation"—I know I am free,
For my sins are all nailed to the cross.
I will cling to my Savior and never depart—
I will joyfully journey each day,
With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away.

I am not ashamed of the name above all names
For it has the power to heal and to save
Strength for the weary, peace to 
the troubled soul
Peace to the troubled soul (2X)
It's the name of Jesus
It's the name of Jesus
Mightier than mountains 
He lives among the weak
Ruler eternal
Lover to me
(Lover to me)
Jesus, name above all
Jesus, name above all

Nations that long in darkness walked
Have now beheld a glorious light;
On them who dwelt in shades of death
The light hath shined heav’nly bright.
For lo! the virgin’s Child is born;
To us the Son of God is giv’n.
Upon His shoulders shall be laid
The government of earth and Heav’n.
His Name is called Wonderful,
The Counselor, the mighty God,
Eternal Father, Prince of Peace,
Peace dearly purchased with His blood.
His government shall know no bounds,
But far and wide o’er all extend;
And happy peace, the glorious fruits
Of His just reign, shall know no end.
O’er David’s kingdom, on His throne
To rule, and ’stablish it secure
With judgment clear, and justice right;
His reign forever shall endure.

Nature with open volume stands
to spread her Maker's praise abroad
and every labor of his hands
shows something worthy of a God.
But in the grace that rescued man
his brightest form of glory shines;
here, on the cross, 'tis fairest drawn
in precious blood and crimson lines.
Here his whole Name appears complete;
nor wit can guess, nor reason prove
which of the letters best is writ,
the power, the wisdom, or the love.
Oh, the sweet wonders of that cross
where Christ my Savior loved and died!
Her noblest life my spirit draws
from his dear wounds and bleeding side.
I would for ever speak his Name
in sounds to mortal ears unknown,
with angels join to praise the Lamb
and worship at his Father's throne!

Naught have I gotten but what I received;
Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
Boasting excluded, pride I abase;
I'm only a sinner saved by grace! 
Only a sinner saved by grace!
Only a sinner saved by grace!
This is my story, to God be the glory,
I'm only a sinner saved by grace! 
Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy my case;
I now am a sinner saved by grace! 
Tears unavailing, no merit had I;
Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God's face;
But now I'm a sinner saved by grace! 
Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
Loving his Savior to tell what he knows;
Once more to tell it, would I embrace-
I'm only a sinner saved by grace! 

Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all, a healing stream
Flows from Calvary’s mountain.
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the bright and morning star
Sheds its beams around me.
Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o’er me.
Near the cross I’ll watch and wait
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

Near the cross, her vigil keeping,
Stood the mother, worn with weeping,
Where He hung, the dying Lord;
Through her soul, in anguish groaning,
Bowed in sorrow, sighing, moaning,
Passed the sharp and piercing sword.
O the weight of her affliction!
Hers, who won God’s benediction,
Hers, who bore God’s Holy One:
O that speechless, ceaseless yearning!
O those dim eyes never turning
From her wondrous, suffering Son!
Who upon that mother gazing,
In her trouble so amazing,
Born of woman, would not weep?
Who of Christ’s dear mother thinking,
While her Son that cup is drinking,
Would not share her sorrow deep?
For His people’s sin chastised
She beheld her Son despised,
Bound and bleeding ’neath the rod;
Saw the Lord’s Anointed taken,
Dying desolate, forsaken,
Heard Him yield His soul to God.
Near Thy cross, O Christ, abiding,
Grief and love my heart dividing,
I with her would take my place;
By Thy guardian cross uphold me,
In Thy dying, Christ, enfold me
With the deathless arms of grace.

Near the cross was Mary weeping,
There her mournful station keeping,
Gazing on her dying Son;
There in speechless anguish groaning,
Yearning, trembling, sighing, moaning,
Through her soul the sword had gone.
When no eye its pity gave us,
When there was no arm to save us,
He His love and power displayed:
By His stripes He wrought our healing,
By His death, our life revealing,
He for us the ransom paid.
Jesus, may Thy love constrain us,
That from sin we may us,
In Thy griefs may deeply grieve;
Thee our best affections giving,
To Thy glory ever living,
May we in Thy glory live.

Time moves on with solemn footsteps
As it nears the final shore;
Fast the sun of earth is sinking,
Soon our world shall be no more.
The sixth trumpet now is sounding
To prepare the holy bride—
Many on the golden altar,
“Purified, made white, and tried." 
Lo! the angel now is standing
On the sea and on the land;
How His voice the air is rending,
As to God He lifts His hand!
What an awful, awful message!
Help us, Lord, this truth to see;
When the seventh trumpet thunders,
Then shall time no longer be.
One more trumpet yet to summon
Us before the judgment seat,
Then the time of our frail planet
Will be said to be complete.
How the wicked will be wailing,
And the righteous overjoyed,
When with fire the heav’ns are burning,
And the earth shall be destroyed.
While false prophets are confiding
In a foolish, erring dream
Of millennial enjoyments,
They neglect the cleansing stream.
Oh, poor sinner, don’t believe them,
There will be no age to come;
If in life you find not Jesus,
Death will seal your awful doom.

There is a place of quiet rest,
Near to the heart of God.
A place where sin cannot molest,
Near to the heart of God.
O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
Sent from the heart of God,
Hold us who wait before Thee
Near to the heart of God.
There is a place of comfort sweet,
Near to the heart of God.
A place where we our Savior meet,
Near to the heart of God.
There is a place of full release,
Near to the heart of God.
A place where all is joy and peace,
Near to the heart of God.

Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
Draw me, my Savior—so precious Thou art!
Fold me, oh, fold me close to Thy breast.
Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest;"
Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest." 
Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
Naught as an offr'ing to Jesus, my King;
Only my sinful, now contrite heart.
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.
Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine!
Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord, crucified.
Give me but Jesus, my Lord, crucified.
Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last.
Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
Through endless ages ever to be
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee;
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee! 

“Nearer the cross!" my heart can say
I am coming nearer,
Nearer the cross from day to day,
I am coming nearer;
Nearer the cross where Jesus died,
Nearer the fountain’s crimson tide,
Nearer my Savior’s wounded side,
I am coming nearer, I am coming nearer.
Nearer the Christian’s mercy seat,
I am coming nearer;
Feasting my soul on manna sweet
I am coming nearer;
Stronger in faith, more clear I see
Jesus Who gave Himself for me;
Nearer to Him I still would be,
Still I’m coming nearer
Still I’m coming nearer.
Nearer in prayer my hope aspires,
I am coming nearer;
Deeper the love my soul desires,
I am coming nearer;
Nearer the end of toil and care,
Nearer the joy I long to share,
Nearer the crown I soon shall wear;
I am coming nearer;
I am coming nearer.

The Lord is my light, and the strength of my life,
Then of whom shall I be afraid?
He hideth my soul from the troubles that roll,
In the cleft in the rock He has made.
Then nearer, my Savior, to Thee would I come,
Thou knowest the way that I take;
Oh, lead me to glory—there is my home—
With angels Thy praise to awake.
There’s One who will help in the moment of need,
When my heart filled with grief o’erflows;
My Jesus is near, and He sees every tear,
Yea, He shares all my sorrows and woes.
He giveth His angels the charge of my soul
So that none of my steps shall slide;
His promise is sure, He will keep me secure,
Though a thousand should fall by my side.
I ever would dwell in the temple of God,
Where His graces so rich unfold;
Contented to fill just the lowliest place,
That His beauty my eyes may behold.

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone.
Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.
There let the way appear, steps unto Heav’n;
All that Thou sendest me, in mercy given;
Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee.
Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise;
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee.
Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I’ll fly,
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.
There in my Father’s home, safe and at rest,
There in my Savior’s love, perfectly blest;
Age after age to be, nearer my God to Thee.

Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
Draw me, my Savior—so precious Thou art!
Fold me, oh, fold me close to Thy breast.
Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest;"
Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest." 
Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
Naught as an offr'ing to Jesus, my King;
Only my sinful, now contrite heart.
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.
Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine!
Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord, crucified.
Give me but Jesus, my Lord, crucified.
Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last.
Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
Through endless ages ever to be
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee;
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee! 

Somewhere they need you! Somewhere today,
Some one is needing Your cheer on life's way,
Some one will falter Unless you are true,
Somewhere and somehow There's needfor you.
Need for you.need for me.
To be true.brave and free;
Ev'ry day.all the way.
Somewhere there is need for you.
Somewhere they need you! Where grain now falls,
Hear from the reapers their many loud calls;
O how they need you With so much to do,
White is the harvest-- There's need for you.
Need for you.need for me.
To be true.brave and free;
Ev'ry day.all the way.
Somewhere there is need for you.
Somewhere they need you! Beyond the sea,
They are depending On you and on me,
To send the story That Christ loves them too;
To spread His glory, There's need for you.
Need for you.need for me.
To be true.brave and free;
Ev'ry day.all the way.
Somewhere there is need for you.

“Neither do I condemn thee,"
O words of wondrous grace;
Thy sins were born upon the cross,
Believe, and go in peace.
“Neither do I condemn thee,"
O sing it o’er and o’er;
“Neither do I condemn thee,
Go and sin no more."
“Neither do I condemn thee,"
For there is therefore now
No condemnation for thee,
As at the cross you bow.
“Neither do I condemn thee,"
I came not to condemn;
I came from God to save thee,
And turn thee from thy sin.
“Neither do I condemn thee,"
O praise the God of grace;
O praise His Son our Savior,
For this His word of peace.

The chords of love bind me above
To One who never changes;
Nor time, nor space can e’er efface,
His boundless love for me.
Neither height, nor depth, nor breadth, shall separate me
From the love of Him who shed His precious blood;
Neither height, nor depth, nor breadth, shall separate me
From the love of God.
The price He gave, my soul to save,
Upon the cross of anguish;
The shame and woe, O who can know,
How much He cared for me.
His love complete, with joys replete,
Supplies my every longing;
It brings no pain, no loss, but gain,
The love He gives to me.

I’ve seen the lightning flashing, I’ve heard the thunder roll.
I’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing, which almost conquered my soul.
I’ve heard the voice of my Savior, bidding me still to fight on.
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone!
No, never alone, no never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
He’ll claim me for His own;
No, never alone, no never alone.
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.
The world’s fierce winds are blowing, temptation sharp and keen.
I have a peace in knowing my Savior stands between—
He stands to shield me from danger when my friends are all gone.
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone!
When in affliction’s valley I tread the road of care,
My Savior helps me carry the cross so heavy to bear;
Though all around me is darkness, earthly joys all flown;
My Savior whispers His promise, never to leave me alone!
He died on Calvary’s mountain, for me they pierced His side.
For me He opened that fountain, the crimson, cleansing tide.
For me He waiteth in glory, seated upon His throne.
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone!

Never forget that the Savior is near,
Asking if thou wilt receive Him.
He will protect from all danger and fear
Those who love, trust and believe Him.
Never forget that the Master is near,
All of thy life He is viewing;
How doth the record before Him appear,
Art thou His precepts pursuing?
Never forget, never forget,
Jesus is near, O receive Him.
He will come in, cleanse from all sin;
Cheerfully trust and believe Him.
Never forget the good Shepherd is near,
Faithfully leading and guiding,
Turn not away, lest His voice thou shalt hear,
Tenderly pleading and chiding.
Never forget the Redeemer is near,
Nor the dear ransom once given.
If we obey, love, and honor Him here,
We shall dwell with Him in Heaven.

Never further than Thy cross,
Never higher than Thy feet;
Here earth’s precious things seem dross,
Here earth’s bitter things grow sweet.
Gazing thus our sin we see,
Learn Thy love while gazing thus,
Sin, which laid the cross on Thee,
Love, which bore the cross for us.
Here we learn to serve and give,
And, rejoicing, self deny;
Here we gather love to live,
Here we gather faith to die.
Pressing onward as we can,
Still to this our hearts must tend;
Where our earliest hopes began,
There our last aspirings end.
Till amid the hosts of light,
We in Thee redeemed, complete,
Through Thy cross made pure and white,
Cast our crowns before Thy feet.

Never be sad or desponding,
If thou hast faith to believe.
Grace, for the duties before thee,
Ask of thy God and receive.
Never give up, never give up,
Never give up to thy sorrows,
Jesus will bid them depart.
Trust in the Lord, trust in the Lord,
Sing when your trials are greatest,
Trust in the Lord and take heart.
What if thy burdens oppress thee;
What though thy life may be drear;
Look on the side that is brightest,
Pray, and thy path will be clear.
Never be sad or desponding,
There is a morrow for thee;
Soon thou shalt dwell in its brightness,
There with the Lord thou shalt be.
Never be sad or desponding,
Lean on the arm of thy Lord;
Dwell in the depths of His mercy,
Thou shalt receive thy reward.

I have heard of a land on the far away strand,
’Tis a beautiful home of the soul;
Built by Jesus on high, where we never shall die,
’Tis a land where we never grow old.
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where we’ll never grow old;
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where we’ll never grow old.
In that beautiful home where we’ll never more roam,
We shall be in the sweet by and by;
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing,
’Tis a land where we never shall die.
When our work here is done and the life crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are o’er;
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend,
With the loved ones who’ve gone on before.

So you tell me I’m hard to love, you’re better off alone
But each time you run away it’s left you wanting (left you wanting so much)
More to love, more to life, one more day to make it right
Take my hand an let me show you life (let me show you life)
I will never let you go
I just wanted you to know
(Hush now) Oh Hush now don’t say a word
(Until you’ve heard) Until you’ve heard
I will never let you go, no
So you tell me you need a face before you can trust me
The scars left by former love have left you empty (so empty)
I can heal who you are the broken pieces of your heart
Take my hand and let me give you life (let me give you life)
So this sacred romance calls and whispers in your ear
The risk is worth it all to have to hear
I will never let you go
I just wanted you to know
Oh Hush now don’t say a word
Until you’ve heard
I will never let you go, no I won't (never let you go)
I just wanted you to know (you to know)
(Hush now) Oh Hush now don’t say a word
(Until you’ve heard) Until you’ve heard
I will never let you go, no I won't
I will never let you go

O pilgrim bound for the heav'nly land,
Never lose sight of Jesus!
He'll lead you gently with loving hand;
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Day and night He will lead you right;
Never lose sight of Jesus!
When you are tempted to go astray,
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Press onward, upward the narrow way;
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Tho' dark the pathway may seem ahead,
Never lose sight of Jesus!
"Lo, I am with you," His Word hath said:
Never lose sight of Jesus!
When death is knocking outside the door,
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Till safe with Him on the golden shore;
Never lose sight of Jesus! 

In the fight, say, does your heart grow weary?
Do you find your path is rough and thorny?
And above the sky is dark and stormy?
Never mind, go on!
Lay aside all fear, and onward pressing,
Bravely fight, and God will give His blessing;
Though the war at times may prove distressing,
Never mind, go on!
When the road we tread is rough,
Let us bear in mind,
In our Savior strength enough
We may always find;
Though the fighting may be tough
Let our motto be:
Go on, go on to victory!
Faithful be, delaying not to follow
Where Christ leads, though it may be through sorrow;
If the strife should fiercer grow tomorrow,
Never mind, go on!
Cheerful be, it will your burdens lighten,
One glad heart will always others brighten;
Though the strife the coward’s soul may frighten,
Never mind, go on!
When downhearted, look away to Jesus,
Who for you did shed His blood most precious;
Let us say, though all the world should hate us;
Never mind, go on!
Do your best in fighting for your Savior,
For His sake fear not to lose men’s favor;
If beside you should a comrade waver,
Never mind, go on!

Never say goodbye (never say (no), we'll never say no)
Never say goodbye (we'll never say (no), we'll never say no)
(We'll) Never say goodbye (never say goodbye)
When the journey's over (never say (no), we'll never say no)
We won't have to cry (we'll never say (no), we'll never say no)
Cause we'll never say goodbye (never say goodbye)
Down here below the trials come and they beat me down everyday (trials everyday)
But we know that a day will come when the Savior will take us away (take us all 
away)
Where we'll.
I've got friends and they don't know that Jesus is the way (Jesus is the way)
It's up to me to make it known that there will come a day (there will come a 
day)
Where we'll.
Don't you want to come with me a sweet reunion there will be
And every eye will all be dry, we'll never say goodbye
So come along and join with me, we'll praise the Lord eternally
We'll shout and sing with Him on high, we'll never say goodbye, never say 
goodbye

Never shone a light so fair,
Never fell so sweet a song,
As the in the air
Chanted by the angel throng;
Ev’ry star took up the story:
“Christ has come, the Prince of glory,
Come in humble hearts to dwell;
God with us, God with us,
God with us, Immanuel!"
Still that Jubilee of song
Breaks upon the rising morn;
While the anthem rolls along,
Floods of light the earth adorn;
Old and young take up the story:
Welcome now the blessed day,
When we praise the Lord our King;
When we meet to praise and pray,
And His love with gladness sing;
Let the world take up the story:

New every morning, fresh every day
Your sweet compassions will never fail
Your lovingkindness will never cease
Great is your faithfulness,
oh Lord to me
Great is your faithfulness,
oh Lord to me
In every struggle, through every storm
In times of trouble, I'm not alone
New waves of comfort, of strength and peace
Great is your faithfulness,
oh Lord to me
Great is your faithfulness,

New every morning is the love
Our wakening and uprising prove;
Through sleep and darkness safely brought,
Restored to life and power and thought.
New mercies, each returning day,
Hover around us while we pray;
New perils past, new sins forgiven,
New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven.
If, on our daily course, our mind
Be set to hallow all we find,
New treasures still, of countless price,
God will provide for sacrifice.
Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,
As more of heaven in each we see;
Some softening gleam of love and prayer
Shall dawn on every cross and care.
We need not bid, for cloistered cell,
Our neighbor and our words farewell,
Nor strive to find ourselves too high
For sinful man beneath the sky.
The trivial round, the common task,
Will furnish all we ought to ask;
Room to deny ourselves, a road
To bring us daily nearer God.
Seek we no more; content with these,
Let present rapture, comfort, ease—
As heaven shall bid them, come and go:
The secret this of rest below.
Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love,
Fit us for perfect rest above,
And help us, this and every day,
To live more nearly as we pray.

I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord:
This was freely given, and I found
That He always kept His word.
There’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
And the white robed angels sing the story,
“A sinner has come home."
For there’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,
Never more to roam.
I was humbly kneeling at the cross,
Fearing naught by God’s angry frown;
When the heavens opened and I saw
That my name was written down.
In the Book ’tis written, “Saved by Grace,"
O the joy that came to my soul!
Now I am forgiven, and I know
By the blood I am made whole.

Your ways, oh Lord, are good and faithful,
No one whose hope is in You
Will ever be put to shame;
You turned my sorrow into dancing,
You turned my tears to joy.
You've given my heart a new song,
And my heart can't be silent anymore; (Oh I can sing)
For I am not afraid to do Your will, Lord
To live is Christ; to die is gain.
When I'm afraid, You give me shelter;
When I am weak, You give me strength;
I cried for mercy, and You healed me;
You brought me up from the grave.

There's a new song arisin' in the hearts of His children;
A new song arisin' in the hearts of His own.
There's a new song arisin' in the hearts of His children;
A new song arisin' in the hearts of His own.
VERSE:
A song of hope, a song of peace.
The sound of liberation, the shout of victory,
The hymm of praise, the new song of God.
Many will see and fear
And put their trust in our Lord.
With the oil of joy
He's anointing His children.
The music He gives sets the nations free.
With the oil of joy
He's anointing His children
And the dance of our Father's bringing liberty.

New songs of celebration render
to him who has great wonders done.
Love sits enthroned in ageless splendor:
come and adore the Mighty One.
He has made known his great salvation
which all his friends with joy confess; 
he has revealed to every nation
his everlasting righteousness.
Joyfully, heartily resounding,
let every instrument and voice
peal out the praise of grace abounding,
calling the whole world to rejoice.
Trumpets and organs set in motion
such sounds as make the heavens ring;
all things that live in earth and ocean, 
make music for your mighty King.
Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,
honor the Lord with wild acclaim;
mountains and stones look up adoring
and find a voice to praise his Name.
Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,
praises be his that never cease;
just is our God, whose truth victorious
establishes the world in peace.

New, new wine
The kind that makes you smile all the time
I heard about it just a little while ago
And ever since I did I just can't let this happy feelin' go
New, new wine
The kind that makes you smile all the time
Pardon my funny grin I'm just a new wineskin
Holding new, new wine
Now it's not from moonshine, but it comes from Sonshine
Straight from Heaven above
It won't make you lazy or make your mind crazy
Or make you cry over some long gone lost love
Now money can't buy it but once you try it
You'll have a lifetime supply
The Savior will give it through His Holy Spirit
Joy like a river makes you feel so fine
Pardon if I have to laugh
I've traded them old grapes o' wrath
For new, new wine

New wonders of Thy mighty hand,
Lord, we today admire,
Writ on the firmament above
In glittering orbs of fire.
The sun is ruler of the day,
The silver moon of night,
The starry hosts adorn the sky
In ordered ranks of light.
But e’en that glorious sun must set,
And knows his going down,
That silver moon must wax and wane,
The stars their courses own.
Still in an ever changing round
The daylight comes and goes;
But Thou art evermore the same,
No change Thy mercy knows.
Why waver then our troubled hearts?
Thine is a Father’s care;
And they, eternal life who seek,
Eternal life shall share.
All praise, all glory be ascribed
To God the One in Three,
Who bids us cast our care on Him,
To Him for comfort flee.

Night, with ebon pinion, brooded o’er the vale;
All around was silent, save the night wind’s wail,
When Christ, the Man of Sorrows,
In tears, and sweat, and blood,
Prostrate in the garden, raised His voice to God.
Smitten for offenses which were not His own,
He, for our transgressions, had to weep alone;
No friend with words to comfort,
Nor hand to help was there,
When the Meek and Lowly humbly bowed in prayer.
“Abba, Father, Father, if indeed it may,
Let this cup of anguish pass from Me, I pray;
Yet, if it must be suffered, by Me, Thine only Son,
Abba, Father, Father, let Thy will be done."

No blood, no altar now, The sacrifice is o'er!
No flame, no smoke ascends on high,
The lamb is slain no more,
But richer blood has flowed from nobler veins,
To purge the soul from guilt, and cleanse the reddest stains.
We thank Thee for the blood, The blood of Christ, Thy Son:
The blood by which our peace is made,
Our victory is won:
Great victory o'er hell, and sin, and woe,
That needs no second fight, and leaves no second foe.
We thank Thee for the grace, Descending from above,
That overflows our widest guilt,
The'eternal Father's love.
Love of the Father's everlasting Son,
Love of the Holy Ghost, Jehovah, Three in One.
We thank Thee for the hope, So glad, and sure, and clear;
It holds the drooping spirit up
Till the long dawn appear;
Fair hope! with what a sunshine does it cheer
Our roughest path on earth, our dreariest desert here.
We thank Thee for the crown Of glory and of life;
'Tis no poor with'ring wreath of earth,
Man's prize in mortal strife;
'Tis incorruptible as is the throne,
The kingdom of our God and His incarnate Son.

No burdens yonder, not a single care,
When home is entered, not a load to bear;
No burdens yonder, all will be laid down
Before we share His glory and His throne.
No burdens yonder,
All sorrow past;
No burdens yonder,
Home at last.
No trials yonder, all the testing done,
The schooldays over and the prizes won;
No much-tried faith like gold in furnace heat,
The purifying will be all complete.
No toiling yonder, and no weariness,
No disappointments, and no more distress;
The future bright, the past all understood,
We’ll see that all the way He led was good.
No parting yonder, and no sad goodbyes,
No pain, no sickness, and no weeping eyes;
But, best of all, my Savior I shall see,
No cloud will come between my Lord and me.

No change of time shall ever shock
My firm affection, Lord, to Thee;
For Thou hast always been a Rock,
A Fortress and Defense to me.
Thou my Deliverer art, my God;
My trust is in Thy mighty power:
Thou art my Shield from foes abroad;
At home, my Safeguard and my Tower.
To Thee I will address my prayer,
To whom all praise we justly owe;
So shall I, by Thy watchful care,
Be guarded safe from every foe.
Let the eternal Lord be praised,
The Rock on whose defense I rest:
O’er highest heavens His Name be raised,
Who me with His salvation blest.

No compromise with evil shall be our battle cry,
For God and right must conquer, and sin and wrong must die;
Unflinching we are standing, uncompromisingly,
Beneath the flag of holiness forever we will be.
No compromise, no compromise,
This shall be our battle cry,
For God and right we will boldly fight,
We will keep the standard high.
No compromise with error, for Bible truth we stand,
Let none remove the landmarks erected by God’s hand.
With loyalty our watchword and faith in Christ our stay,
We’ll bravely storm the forts of sin and thro’ Him win the day.
No compromise with worldliness, no yielding to the wrong,
No lowering the standard that’s stood thro’ ages long;
With Jesus as our Leader, His Spirit as our Guide,
We’ll firmly stand for righteousness whatever may betide.

There is no condemnation for those who are in Jesus Christ
There is no condemnation for those who lean on the Lord
There is only great blessings for those who receive His Great Spirit
So believe in His presence for He is the light of the world 
Jesus died on the cross to set me free
Where salvation was given on Calvary
Redeemed by the blood of Christ I am
Oh the pain that He suffered for this man 
And we know that in all things
God works for the good of those (received Him)
Who are in Christ the Lord (Christ the Lord) 
If in the heart man believes
And with the mouth confesses that
Jesus Christ, He is the Lord (He is Lord) 
So believe in His presence for He is the light of the world
There is no condemnation for those who are in Jesus Christ

There is no condemnation for those who are in Jesus Christ
There is no condemnation for those who lean on the Lord
There is only great blessings for those who receive His Great Spirit
So believe in His presence for He is the light of the world 
Jesus died on the cross to set me free
Where salvation was given on Calvary
Redeemed by the blood of Christ I am
Oh the pain that He suffered for this man 
And we know that in all things
God works for the good of those (received Him)
Who are in Christ the Lord (Christ the Lord) 
If in the heart man believes
And with the mouth confesses that
Jesus Christ, He is the Lord (He is Lord) 
So believe in His presence for He is the light of the world
There is no condemnation for those who are in Jesus Christ

What tho' our backs are bending at times beneath the load,
When oft the cross is heavy that we bear,
This thought should bring us comfort opon life's weary road,
There'll be no cross to carry over there.
There'll be no cross to carry over there,
Not a burden, not a sorrow, not a care;
Tho' here we faint and falter and bend beneath the load,
There will be no cross to carry over there.
Perhaps a cross of sorrow has almost weighed us down,
When skies are filled with clouds of dark despair,
'Tis then we hear Faith whisper, "Beyond the Cross the Crown,
There'll be no cross to carry over there."
There'll be no cross to carry over there,
Not a burden, not a sorrow, not a care;
Tho' here we faint and falter and bend beneath the load,
There will be no cross to carry over there.
If we would reign with Jesus above yon starry dome,
His cross while on our journey we must share,
But O, the joy of finding when we are safe at home,
There'll be no cross to carry over there.
There'll be no cross to carry over there,
Not a burden, not a sorrow, not a care;
Tho' here we faint and falter and bend beneath the load,
There will be no cross to carry over there.
So we will bear for Jesus His cross along life's way,
Until we reach those mansions bright and fair,
Then we'll sing hallelujah, because for endless days
There'll be no cross to carry over there.
There'll be no cross to carry over there,
Not a burden, not a sorrow, not a care;
Tho' here we faint and falter and bend beneath the load,
There will be no cross to carry over there.

Oh fear the hearts of men are failing
These are latter days we know
The Great Depression now is spreading
God's Word declared it would be so
I'm going where there's no depression
To a better land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in heaven, I'm going there
In this dark hour, midnight nearing
The tribulation time will come
The storms will hurl the midnight fear
And sweep lost millions to their doom
3x
.heaven, I'm going there

There's no disappointment in heaven
No weariness sorrow or pain
No hearts that are bleeding and broken
No song with a minor 
The clouds of our earthly horizon
Will never appear in the sky
For all will be sunshine and gladness
With never a sob or a sigh
I'm bound for that beautiful city
My Lord has prepared for his own
Where all the redeemed of all ages
Sing glory around the white throne
Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven
And the glories I there shall behold
What a joy that will be
When my Saviour I see
In that beautiful city of gold
We'll never pay rent for our mansion
The taxes will never come due
Our garments will never grow threadbare
But always be fadeless and new
We'll never be hungry or thirsty
Nor languish in poverty there
For all the rich bounties of heaven
His sanctified children will share
There'll never be crepe on the doorknob
No funeral train in the sky
No graves on the hillsides of glory
For there we shall never more die
The old will be young there forever
Transformed in a moment of time
Immortal we'll stand in His likeness 
The stars and the sun to outshine

No distant Lord have I,
Loving afar to be;
Made flesh for me, He cannot rest
Until He rests in me.
Brother in joy and pain,
Bone of my bone was He;
More intimate and closer still—
He dwells Himself in me.
I need not journey far
This dearest Friend to see;
Companionship is always mine;
He makes His home with me.

A land by faith I see,
Where saints shall ever be
Free from mortality,
No dying there.
No dying there,
No dying there,
In that fair, heav’nly land,
No dying there.
There friends shall meet again,
In happiness to reign,
While through that blest domain,
No dying there.
There sorrow cannot stay;
There tears are wiped away,
One bright, eternal day,
No dying there.

We were made in God's image (hallelujah)
We can choose our attitude (hey it's all because of Him)
We're made in God's image
And we choose to feel good 
We were made in God's image
We can choose our attitude (we choose to feel so good)
We're made in God's image (so so so so so good)
And we choose to feel good (I feel so good)
We were made in God's image (hallelujah)
We can choose our attitude (can't keep it to myself)
We're made in God's image (oh yeah)
And we choose to feel good (oh yeah)
We were made in God's image (feel so good)
We can choose our attitude (hey, we feel so)
We're made in God's image (hallelujah)
And we choose to feel good 

No form of human framing, no bond of outward might,
Can bind Thy Church together, Lord, and all her flocks unite;
But, Jesus, Thou hast told us how unity must be:
Thou art with God the Father one, and we are one in Thee.
The mind that is in Jesus will guide us into truth,
The humble, open, joyful mind of ever-learning youth;
The heart that is in Jesus will lead us out of strife,
The giving and forgiving heart that follows love in life.
Wherever men adore Thee, our souls with them would kneel;
Wherever men implore Thy help, their trouble we would feel;
And where men do Thy service, though knowing not Thy sign,
Our hand is with them in good work, for they are also Thine.
Forgive us, Lord, the folly that quarrels with Thy friends,
And draw us near to Thy heart, where every discord ends;
Thou art the crown of manhood, and Thou of God the Son;
O Master of our many lives, in Thee our life is one.

There is not a friend like Jesus
In the trying scenes of life;
He can hear the heart’s faint whisper,
Calm the tempest’s raging strife.
There is not a friend like Jesus,
Patient, tender, kind, and true;
If you’ll be a friend of Jesus,
He will be a friend to you.
There is not a friend like Jesus,
Bid the scoffing world adieu;
For if you’re ashamed of Jesus,
He will be ashamed of you.
There is not a friend like Jesus,
Trust Him everywhere you go;
He has trod the way before you,
Suffered every pain and woe.
There is not a friend like Jesus
When you draw your life’s last breath;
If you’ll be His friend while living,
He will be your friend in death.
There is not a friend like Jesus;
What a blessed thought to be
Folded in His arms of power,
Ever in eternity.

Oh, to have no Christ, no Savior!
No Rock, no Refuge nigh!
When the dark days ’round thee gather,
When the storms sweep o’er the sky!
Oh, to have no hope in Jesus!
No Friend, no Light in Jesus!
Oh, to have no hope in Jesus!
How dark this world must be!
Oh, to have no Christ, no Savior!
How lonely life must be!
Like a sailor, lost and driven,
On a wide and shoreless sea.
Oh, to have no Christ, no Savior!
No hand to clasp thine own!
Thro’ the dark, dark vale of shadows,
Thou must press thy way alone.
Now, we pray thee, come to Jesus;
His pard’ning love receive;
For the Savior now is calling,
And He bids thee turn and live.
Come to Jesus, He will save you;
He is the Friend of sinners;
Then, when thou hast found the Savior,
How bright this world will be!

Ye armies of the living God,
With banner, shield and sword,
March onward, shouting as you go,
“No king but Christ our Lord."
All crowns be on His sacred head,
All worlds be at His feet,
All scepters in His mighty hand,
All tongues His praise repeat.
Salvation, glory, strength and power
Ascribe to Him alone,
Whose truth established firmly stands,
Eternal as His throne.
Untraversed regions, boundless realms,
Their great first cause adore,
He rules in majesty supreme,
And reigns from shore to shore.
March on, ye victors through His grace,
To Him your trophies bring,
Creator, Savior, Prophet, Priest,
Redeemer, Lord and King.

On life’s pathway I am never lonely,
My Lord is with me, my Lord divine;
Ever present Guide, I trust Him only,
No longer lonely, for He is mine.
No longer lonely, no longer lonely,
For Jesus is the Friend of friends to me;
No longer lonely, no longer lonely,
For Jesus is the Friend of friends to me.
I shall not be lonely in my sorrow,
He will sustain me until the end;
Darkest night He turns to brightest morrow,
No longer lonely! He is my Friend.
I shall not be lonely in the valley
Tho’ shadows gather, I will not fear;
He has promised ever to uphold me,
No longer lonely! He will be near.

No longer of Him be it said,
“He hath no place to lay His head";
In every land a constant lamp
Flames by His small and mighty camp.
There is no strange and distant place
That is not gladdened by His face;
And every nation kneels to hail
The Splendor shining through its veil.
Imprisoned for His love of me
He makes my spirit greatly free;
And through my lips that uttered sin
The King of Glory enters in.

Ain't got no love!
Ain't got no love! 
I ain't got no love like Your love
I ain't got no love like Your love
You're everything I'll ever need
Always the light inside of me
No one could ever give me more
I've got a heart so hungry for Your love
I ain't got no love like Your love
Ain't got no love! 
I was livin' in such loneliness
Wishin' someone else would take the blame
Findin' everything but happiness
But win or lose it all just felt the same 
Until You, I had nothing to hold on to
Until You, love just caught me by surprise
Because of You, life is more than just a circumstance
That comes and goes without a reason why 
Though I wasn't easily persuaded (now I)
Now I can't get enough (while you)
While You patiently waited (your love)
To give me unconditional love 
(Improv) 
Until You, I had nothing to hold on to

I ain't gonna worry
I ain't gonna doubt
There'll be no more wasted years (no more wasted years)
I'm just gonna let the Lord me yeah
I know my Jesus.

No more, dear Savior, will I boast
Of beauty, wealth, or loud applause,
The world has all its glories lost,
Amid the triumphs of the cross.
In every feature of Thy face
Beauty her fairest charms displays;
Truth, wisdom, majesty, and grace,
Shine thence in sweetly mingled rays.
Thy wealth the pow’r of thought transcends,
’Tis vast, immense, and all divine;
Thy empire, Lord, o’er all extends—
The sun, the moon, the stars are Thine.
Yet, oh how marvelous the sight!
I see Thee on a cross expire;
Thy Godhead veiled in sable night,
And angels from the scene retire.

How many times discouraged, we sink beside the way;
About us all is darkness, we hardly dare to pray;
Then from the mists and shadows, the sweetest voice e'er known,
Says, "Child, am I not with thee, never to leave thee alone?"
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone!
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone!
O soul, hast thou forgotten, the tender word and sweet,
Of Him who left behind Him the print of bleeding feet?
"I never will forsake thee, O child so wea ry grown;
Remember, I have promised, never to leave thee alone?"
Take courage, wayworn pilgrim, tho' mists and shadows hide
The face of Him thou lovest, He's ever at thy side;
Reach out thy hand and find Him, and lo, the clouds have flown;
He smiles on thee who promised, never to

In the land of fadeless day,
Lies “the city foursquare,"
It shall never pass away,
And there is “no night there."
God shall “wipe away all tears"
There’s no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is “no night there."
All the gates of pearl are made,
In “the city foursquare,"
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is “no night there."
All the gates shall never close,
To “the city foursquare,"
There life’s crystal river flows,
And there is “no night there."
There they need no sunshine bright,
In “that city foursquare,"
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is “no night there."
leave thee alone.

None else could heal all our souls diseases
No, not one! No, not one!

I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus,
Since I found in Him a friend so strong and true;
I would tell you how He changed my life completely,
He did something that no other friend could do.
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There's no other friend so kind as He;
No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
O how much He cared for me.
All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me,
All my heart was full of misery and woe;
Jesus placed His strong and loving arms about me,
And He led me in the way I ought to go.
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There's no other friend so kind as He;
No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
O how much He cared for me.
Ev'ry day He comes to me with new assurance,
More and more I understand His words of love;
But I'll never know just why He came to save me,
Till some day I see His blessed face above.
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There's no other friend so kind as He;
No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
O how much He cared for me.

There's no one like you in all the earth
There's no one like you in the heavens
There's no one like you who knows my weakness
Who knows my frailty and my desi - re
( 1)
Is to know you all my days
Is to know you as my Savior
Is to know you in your beauty
In your power and your glory
There's no one like you, No one
There's no one like you, No one
There's no one like you in all the earth
There's no one like you in the heavens
There's no one like you who sings so sweetly
Who shines so brighty and is so holy
( 2)
And I will praise you all my days
I will praise you as my Savior
I will praise you in you beauty
In your power and your glory
There's no one like you, No one
There's no one like you, No one

Are the burdens you carry too heavy to bear?
Does the weight of your sin fill your heart with despair?
Go to Jesus for aid, He will answer your prayer;
There is no one who loves you so.
There is no one who loves you like Jesus,
No one who loves you so;
For the cross you lay down
He will give you a crown;
There is no one who loves you so.
Do you think in your sorrow you suffer alone?
All your grief and your sadness to Him are made known;
He hath never forsaken or turned from His own;
There is no one who loves you so.
He alone can redeem you from darkness and woe;
He will wash all your sins till they’re white as the snow,
And His wonderful grace you may constantly know;
There is no one who loves you so.

No one understands like Jesus;
He's a Friend beyond com-pare.
Meet Him at the throne of mercy;
He is waiting for You there.
No one under-stands like Jesus
When the days are dark and grim.
No one is so near, so dear as Jesus;
Cast Your every care on Him.
No understands like Jesus;
Every woe He sees and feels.
Tenderly He whispers comfort,
And the broken heart He heals.
(
No one understands like Jesus
When the foes of life assail.
You should never be discouraged;
Jesus cares and will not fail.
(
NO one understands like Jesus
When you falter on the way.
Though you fail Him, sadly fail Him,
He will pardon You today.

No other day was quite like that day
None other like Christmas morn
No other day was quite like that day
Day when the Savior was born 
No other day was quite like that day
Day that the prophets foresaw
No other day was quite like that day
Giver fulfilling the law 
No other day was quite like that day
None other saw greater things
No other day was quite like that day
Born to the earth King of Kings 
No other day was quite like that day
Born to the earth King of Kings (born to the earth King of Kings)
Born to the earth King of Kings

One offer of salvation,
To all the world make known;
The only sure foundation
Is Christ the Cornerstone.
No other name is given,
No other way is known,
’Tis Jesus Christ the First and Last,
He saves, and He alone.
One only door of Heaven
Stands open wide today,
One sacrifice is given,
’Tis Christ, the living way.
My only song and story
Is—Jesus died for me;
My only hope of glory,
The Cross of Calvary.

My faith has found a resting-place,
Not in device or creed;
I trust the Ever-living One;
His wounds for me shall plead.
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.
Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
He'll never cast me out.
My heart is leaning on the Word,
The written Word of God,
Salvation by my Saviour's name,
Salvation thro' His blood.
My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.

No other story will bear repeating
As often as this is told;
God’s glad good news of His love to sinners
Are tidings which never grow old.
Tell it again and again,
Tell it again and again,
The Gospel story, of grace and glory,
Bears telling again and again.
Proclaim with joy how the cross of suff’ring
Will never be borne again.
That only glory awaits the Savior,
That soon He will come to reign.
Go tell the story in far off countries,
Let ev’ry poor sinner hear
How Christ the Savior has died to win them,
His love overcomes all fear.
The whole sweet story is not yet finished,
The sequel is but begun;
When all the ransomed are safely gathered,
E’en then it will not be done.
Each heart that opens to hear the tidings,
Receiving the Savior’s love,
Will add a page to redemption’s history
Rehearsed in the Home above.

No beautiful chamber, no soft cradle bed,
No place but a manger, nowhere for His head;
No praises of gladness, no thought of their sin,
No glory but sadness, no room in the inn.
No room, no room, for Jesus,
O give Him welcome free,
Lest you should hear at Heaven’s gate,
“There is no room for thee."
No sweet consecration, no seeking His part,
No humiliation, no place in the heart;
No thought of the Savior, no sorrow for sin,
No prayer for His favor, no room in the inn.
No one to receive Him, no welcome while here,
No balm to relieve Him, no staff but a spear;
No seeking His treasure, no weeping for sin,
No doing His pleasure, no room in the inn.

He was no run of the mill Messiah, walked the road to Calvary
No average Savior, Jehovah, and Lord is the bread of life for me
No run of the mill Messiah came back to life on the third day
As He promised and said, so He lived and He bled, showing He was the truth, 
life, and way
More that a prophet and more than just a preacher
He was a servant sculpting souls with His hands
More than a carpenter, more than just a teacher
More than an angel and more than a man
Follow His sandleprints and see where they lead us
Smell the sawdust of the carpenter's shop
See the one and only leper thanking Jesus
Of Galilee and born of divine thought
Once you have seen Him, a glimpse of the Savior
You'll long to see Him each day
His words can help us change our behavior
Satan stay out of our way
No run of the mill Messiah

No strength of nature can suffice
To serve the Lord aright;
And what she has, she misapplies,
For want of clearer light.
How long beneath the Law I lay
In bondage and distress!
I toiled the precept to obey,
But toiled without success.
Then to abstain from outward sin
Was more than I could do;
Now, if I feel its power within,
I feel I hate it too.
Then all my servile works were done
A righteousness to raise;
Now, freely chosen in the Son,
I freely choose His ways.
What shall I do was then the word,
That I may worthier grow?
What shall I render to the Lord?
Is my inquiry now.
To see the Law by Christ fulfilled,
And hear His pardoning voice;
Changes a slave into a child,
And duty into choice.

Our youth is transient like a flower,
That blooms, and fades, and dies;
Our life is but a summer cloud,
And like a shadow flies;
Then let us heed the warning voice—
Today its call we hear,
It speaks in deep and solemn tones,
That come from yonder bier.
The angel messenger of death,
Has gently borne away,
A dear companion from our side,
To realms of endless day;
Her voice no more will join with ours
The song of praise below,
It wakes a purer, sweeter strain,
Where only pleasures flow.
When gathered on the Sabbath morn,
Her vacant place we view,
We’ll think how bright the world she treads,
And in her steps pursue;
Be still, let every heart be still,
And all our sorrow quell,
We’ll bow submissive to His will,
Who doeth all things well.

We come again, O gracious Lord,
Around Thy hallowed mercy seat,
To feast upon Thy living Word,
And lay our burdens at Thy feet.
Shut out the world, that we may see
Within our midst no one but Thee;
Our love inspire through faith divine,
That we may hear no voice but Thine.
We come again, for still we need
Refreshing showers our hearts to cheer,
In Thy dear Name the grace we plead,
That to Thy throne will bring us near.
Our strength renew, our hope increase,
And may we now Thy blessings share;
Keep Thou Thine own in perfect peace,
Control our thoughts, direct our prayer.
And when this hour shall pass away,
Oh, may Thy presence come so near
That from our hearts we all may say,
’Twas good for us to gather here.

No, no, it is not dying
To go unto our God;
This gloomy earth forsaking,
Our journey homeward taking
Along the starry road.
No, no, it is not dying
Heaven’s citizen to be;
A crown immortal wearing,
And rest unbroken sharing,
From care and conflict free.
No, no it is not dying
To hear this gracious word,
“Receive a Father’s blessing,
Forevermore possessing
The favor of thy Lord."
No, no it is not dying
The Shepherd’s voice to know:
His sheep He ever leadeth,
His peaceful flock He feedeth,
Where living pastures grow.
No, no it is not dying
To wear a lordly crown;
Among God’s people dwelling,
The glorious triumph swelling
Of Him Whose sway we own.

No, not despairingly come I to Thee;
No, not distrustingly bend I the knee:
Sin hath gone over me, yet is this still my plea,
Jesus hath died.
Ah! mine iniquity crimson hath been,
Infinite, infinite—sin upon sin:
Sin of not loving Thee, sin of not trusting Thee—
Infinite sin.
Lord, I confess to Thee sadly my sin;
All I am tell with Thee, all I have been:
Purge Thou my sin away, wash Thou my soul this day;
Lord, make me clean.
Faithful and just art Thou, forgiving all;
Loving and kind art Thou when poor ones call:
Lord, let the cleansing blood, blood of the Lamb of God,
Pass o’er my soul.
Then all is peace and light this soul within;
Thus shall I walk with Thee, the loved Unseen;
Leaning on Thee, my God, guided along the road,
Nothing between.

There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus
No, not one! No, not one!
None else could heal all our souls diseases
No, not one! No, not one!
Jesus knows all about our struggles
He will guide till the day is done
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus
No, not one! No, not one!
No friend like Him is so high and holy
No, not one! No, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly
No, not one! No, not one!
There's not an hour that He is not near us
No, not one! No, not one!
No night so dark but His love can cheer us
No, not one! No, not one!

Well the world was wicked
Sin polluting the land

God saw light in Noah's clan
He knew that Noah would follow His plan

Noah and his family and then God shut the door
For forty days and nights the floodwaters they poured
And everything living on earth was no more

Oh, yes, Lord.
I never shall
Forget that day
Oh, yes, Lord,
When Jesus washed my sins away,
Oh, yes, Lord.

Stranded on the inside, 
Fragile like a little child
All our hearts are orphaned by the f--all 
Longing for affection, in a world of too much rejection,
Don't we feel invisible and s----mall
Nobody's child there is a place for you 
Where your abandoned heart can come home to 
Nobody's child a place where you belong,
Where you can rest your soul awhile 
A place where you can be a child.
I've known that emotion, isolation like an ocean
Your heart will find it's home in arms of love.
Nobody's child there is a place for you 
Where your abandoned heart can come home to 
Nobody's child a place where you belong,
Where you can rest your soul awhile 
A place where you can be a child.
Come all you ragged and unshod, 
Come and be embraced and loved by God

Nobody's child there is a place for you

She stood before the angel
Amazed at what she heard (she heard)
Wondering of the turth she finds
Hidden in His words 
He said, "Mary you have been blessed of God
You'll not forget this day (blessed holy day)
You're the mother of the Promised One"
And you could hear her say 
Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël)
Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël)
Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël)
Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël) 
They stood upon the hillside
Watchmen of the night
Guarding very patiently
Bathed in soft starlight (soft starlight) 
Then angels appeared in majesty
Bringing joy to make the heavens ring (heavens ring)
A Savior's born in Bethlehem
And men and angels sing 
There is so much more to Christmas (so much more)
Than what we see each year
More than a holiday
Much more than it appears 
So we stand among the many
And lift our voice as one (lift our voice in song)
Like Mary we know the truth is found
Only through her Son (holy Son of God) 
Generations celebrate
The day that Christ was born (Jesus Christ was born)
But since we found the grace of God
It's Christmas every morn 
Jesus (Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël))
Blessed Messiah (Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël))

Jesus (Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël))
The reason for the season (Holy Lord (Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël))

O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,
And found in Thee alone,
The peace, the joy I sought so long,
The bliss till now unknown.
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
None other name for me;
There's love, and life, and lasting joy,
Lord Jesus, found in Thee.
I sighed for rest and happiness,
I yearned for them, not Thee;
But while I passed my Saviour by,
His love laid hold on me.
I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
But ah! the waters failed!
E'en as I stooped to drink they'd fled,
And mocked me as I wailed.
The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,
But never wept for Thee,
Till grace the sightless eyes received,
Thy loveliness to see.

In the quiet
In the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your presence
I know there I am restored
When You call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise
In the chaos in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your will
When You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days
All my delight is in You Lord
All of my hope
All of my strength
All my delight is in You Lord
Forever more

None else but Thee, for evermore,
One, All, we dread, believe, adore:
Great Earth and Heaven shall have their day
And worn and old shall pass away,
But Thou remainest, on Thy throne
Eternal, changeless, and alone!
None else we praise! in every form,
In peace of calm and power of storm,
In simple flower and mystic star,
In all around and all afar,
In Grandeur, Beauty, Truth, but Thee
None else we hear, None else we see.
None else we love! for sweeter grace
That made anew a ruined race:
The heirs of life, the lords of death,
With earliest voice and latest breath,
When days begin, when days are done,
Bless we the Father for the Son!
None else we trust! our flesh may fail,
Our heart may sink when foes assail,
But Thou art strength to be our stay,
And Glory not to pass away:
None else in life and death have we,
But we have all in all with Thee!
Yea, None but Thee all worlds confess,
And those redeemed ones numberless:
None else, from everlasting One,
And evermore beside Thee none.
Of all that is, has been, shall be,
Father of Life, None else but Thee!

None is like God, Who reigns above,
So great, so pure, so high;
None is like God, Whose Name is Love,
And Who is always nigh.
In all the earth there is no spot
Excluded from His care;
We cannot go where God is not,
For He is everywhere.
He is our best and kindest Friend,
And guards us night and day;
To all our wants He will attend,
And answer when we pray.
O if we love Him as we ought,
And on His grace rely,
We shall be joyful at the thought
That God is always nigh.

Oh, the bitter pain and sorrow
That a time could ever be,
When I proudly said to Jesus,
“All of self, and none of Thee."
All of self, and none of Thee,
All of self, and none of Thee,
When I proudly said to Jesus,
“All of self, and none of Thee." 
Yet He found me; I beheld Him
Bleeding on th’ accursed tree,
And my wistful heart said faintly,
“Some of self, and some of Thee."
Some of self, and some of Thee,
Some of self, and some of Thee,
And my wistful heart said faintly,
“Some of self, and some of Thee." 
Day by day His tender mercy,
Healing, helping, full and free,
Brought me lower while I whispered,
“Less of self, and more of Thee."
Less of self, and more of Thee,
Less of self, and more or Thee,
Brought me lower while I whispered,
“Less of self, and more of Thee." 
Higher than the highest heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lord, Thy love at last has conquered:
“None of self, and all of Thee."
None of self, and all of Thee,
None of self, and all of Thee,
Lord, Thy love at last has conquered:
“None of self, and all of Thee." 

None other Lamb, none other Name,
None other hope in Heav’n or earth or sea,
None other hiding place from guilt and shame,
None beside Thee!
My faith burns low, my hope burns low;
Only my heart’s desire cries out in me
By the deep thunder of its want and woe,
Cries out to Thee.
Lord, Thou art Life, though I be dead;
Love’s fire Thou art, however cold I be:
Nor Heav’n have I, nor place to lay my head,
Nor home, but Thee.

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
Nor riches of earth could have saved my poor soul;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior now maketh me whole.
I am redeemed, but not with silver,
I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price, the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior could only atone.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The holy commandment forbade me draw near;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior removeth my fear.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The way into Heaven could not thus be bought;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior redemption hath wrought.

He is not a disappointment;
Christ has saved my soul from sin;
All the guilt and all the anguish
Which oppressed my heart within.
He has banished, by His presence,
All that stole my inner peace;
And He gives me full assurance
That His love will never cease.
He is not a disappointment;
Christ doth sanctify my soul,
Cleanse me from my heart corruption,
Purify and make me whole;
He removed the sinward proneness,
Stamps His image in its place,
For He wins me by the beauty
And unveiling of His face.
He is not a disappointment;
Christ is coming by and by;
In my heart I have the witness
That the day is drawing nigh.
All the scoffers may despise me
And no change around may see;
But He tells me He is coming,
And His Word assureth me.
He is not a disappointment;
Christ is all in all to me—
Saviour, Sanctifier, Sov'reign—
The unchanging God is He;
He has won my heart's devotion,
And He meets my ev'ry need;
He is not a disappointment,
For He satisfies indeed.

Not a thought of earthly things!
Every head in awe be bended:
Christ our God, the King of kings,
Comes by angel troops attended.
Forth He comes, a victim He
For the wide world’s need availing,
And His people’s food to be,
With Himself their souls regaling.
Cherubim with watchful eyes,
Seraphim their brows concealing,
Powers and principalities,
Cry aloud, like thunder pealing.

Not all the blood of beasts
On Jewish altars slain
Could give the guilty conscience peace
Or wash away the stain.
But Christ, the heav’nly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name
And richer blood than they.
My faith would lay her hand
On that dear head of Thine,
While, like a penitent, I stand,
And there confess my sin.
My soul looks back to see
The burdens Thou didst bear
When hanging on the cursed tree,
And hopes her guilt was there.
Believing, we rejoice
To see the curse remove;
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,
And sing His bleeding love.

Not all the outward forms on earth
Nor rites that God has giv'n
Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth
Can raise a soul to heav'n 
The sov'reign will of God alone
Prepares the heirs of grace
Born in the image of his Son
A new, peculiar race 
The Spirit, like some heav'nly wind
Blows on the sons of flesh
Renews the spirit of the mind
And forms the man afresh 
Our quickened souls awake and rise
From the long sleep of death
On heav'nly things we fix our eyes
And praise employs our breath

Not alone for mighty empire, stretching far over land and sea,
Not alone for bounteous harvests, lift we up our hearts to Thee.
Standing in the living present, memory and hope between,
Lord, we would with deep thanksgiving, praise Thee more for things unseen.
Not for battleships and fortress, not for conquests of the sword,
But for conquests of the spirit give we thanks to Thee, O Lord;
For the priceless gift of freedom, for the home, the church, the school,
For the open door to manhood, in a land the people rule.
For the armies of the faithful, souls that passed and left no name;
For the glory that illumines patriot lives of deathless fame.
For our prophets and apostles, loyal to the living Word,
For all heroes of the spirit, give we thanks to Thee, O Lord.
God of justice, save the people from the clash of race and creed,
From the strife of class and faction, make our nation free indeed;
Keep her faith in simple manhood strong as when her life began,
Till it find its full fruition in the brotherhood of man!

Not always on the mount may we
Rapt in the heav’nly vision be:
The shores of thought and feeling know
The Spirit’s tidal ebb and flow.
“Lord it is good abiding here,"
We cry, the heav’nly presence near:
The vision vanishes, our eyes
Are lifted into vacant skies.
Yet hath one such exalted hour
Upon the soul redeeming power,
And its strength, through after days,
We travel our appointed ways,
Till all the lowly vale grows bright,
Transfigured in remembered light,
And in untiring souls we bear
The freshness of the upper air.
The mount for vision: but below
The paths of daily duty go,
And nobler life therein shall own
The pattern on the mountain shown.

I will declare my choice to the nations
Shout for in the congregation
I will worship God, worship God
All my days
Those who love the Lord are satisfied
Those who trust in Him are justified
I will serve my God, serve my God
All my days
Women: When the nations crumble
Men: The word of the Lord will stand
Women: Kings may rise and fall
Men: His love will endure
Women: Though the strong may stumble
Men: Ah the joy of the Lord is strength
All: To my soul
I will not be shaken
I will not be moved
I will not be shaken

Not by far-famed deeds alone
God's Kingdom comes to birth;
The memory of countless saints
Has perished from the earth.
John and Peter, James and Paul,
Have left a mighty fame:
Another of their company
Is nothing but a name.
Yet for him no less the call
And gallant course to run;
His too to hear at journey's end
The Master's glad 'Well done!'

Not by the martyr’s death alone
The saint his crown in Heav’n has won;
There is a triumph robe on high
For bloodless fields of victory.
What though he was not called to feel
The cross, or flame, or torturing wheel,
Yet daily to the world he died;
His flesh, through grace, he crucified.
What though nor chains, nor scourges sore,
Nor cruel beasts his members tore,
Enough if perfect love arise
For Christ a grateful sacrifice.
Lord, grant us so to Thee to turn
That we through life to die may learn,
And thus, when life’s brief day is o’er,
May live with Thee forevermore.
O Fount of sanctity and love,
O perfect Rest of saints above,
All praise, all glory be to Thee
Both now and through eternity.

Not by Thy mighty hand,
Thy wondrous works alone,
But by the marvels of Thy Word,
Thy glory, Lord, is known.
Forth from the eternal gates,
Thine everlasting home,
To sow the seed of truth alone,
Thou didst vouchsafe to come.
And still from age to age,
Thou, gracious Lord, hast been
The Bearer forth of goodly seed,
The Sower still unseen.
And Thou wilt come again,
And Heav’n beneath Thee bow,
To reap the harvest Thou hast sown,
Sower and Reaper Thou.
Watch, Lord, Thy harvest field,
With Thine unsleeping eye,
The children of the kingdom keep
To Thy epiphany!
That, when in Thy great day
The tares shall severed be,
We may be surely gathered in
With all Thy saints to Thee.

“Lo, *she is not dead, but sleeping"—
Thus the blessed Master spake—
Why are all these tears of weeping?
We shall in His likeness wake.
Only sleeping, sweetly sleeping,
While the angels vigil keep;
Jesus gives to His beloved
Rest at last in peaceful sleep.
Just asleep, *her soul immortal,
Dwelling now beyond life’s woes,
Finds from care and pain and sorrow
Sweet and undisturbed repose.
As a dream when one awaketh,
As a tale when it is told;
Thus its flight the spirit taketh,
Dust returns to earthly mold.
Like the pearly drops of morning
Soaring upward toward the sun,
Thus our spirits are returning
To their Maker, one by one.
Death no dreaded sting containeth,
For the soul, in Jesus blest,
O’er the grave a vict’ry gaineth—
He who finds this heav’nly rest.

Not for our sins alone
Thy mercy, Lord, we sue;
Let fall Thy pitying glance
On our devotions, too,
What we have done for Thee,
And what we think to do.
The holiest hours we spend
In prayer upon our knees,
The times when most we deem
The songs of praise will please,
Thou Searcher of all hearts,
Forgiveness pour on these.
And all the gifts we bring,
And all the vows we make,
And all the acts of love
We plan for Thy dear sake,
Into Thy pardoning thought,
O God of mercy, take.
And most, when we, Thy flock,
Before Thine altar bend,
And strange, bewildering thoughts
With those sweet moments blend,
By Him Whose death we plead,
Good Lord, Thy help extend.
Bow down Thine ear and hear!
Open Thine eyes and see!
Our very love is shame,
And we must come to Thee
To make it of Thy grace
What Thou wouldst have it be.

I have read of a beautiful city,
Far away in the kingdom of God;
I have read how its walls are of jasper,
How its streets are all golden and broad;
In the midst of the street is life’s river,
Clear as crystal and pure to behold;
But not half of that city’s bright glory
To mortals has ever been told.
Not half has ever been told;
Not half has ever been told;
Not half of that city’s bright glory
To mortals has ever been told.
I have read of bright mansions in Heaven,
Which the Savior has gone to prepare;
And the saints who on earth have been faithful,
Rest forever with Christ over there;
There no sin ever enters, nor sorrow,
The inhabitants never grow old;
But not half of the wonderful story
To mortals has ever been told.
I have read of white robes for the righteous,
Of bright crowns which the glorified wear,
When our Father shall bid them, “Come, enter,
And My glory eternally share";
How the righteous are evermore blessed
As they walk through the streets of pure gold;
But not half of the wonderful story
To mortals has ever been told.
I have read of a Christ so forgiving,
That vile sinners may ask and receive
Peace and pardon for every transgression,
If when asking they only believe.
I have read how He’ll guide and protect us,
If for safety we enter His fold;
But not half of His goodness and mercy
To mortals has ever been told.

Not haughty is my heart,
Not lofty is my pride;
I do not seek to know the things
God’s wisdom hath denied.
With childlike trust, O Lord,
In Thee I calmly rest,
Contented as a little child
Upon its mother’s breast.
Ye people of the Lord,
In Him alone confide;
From this time forth and evermore
His wisdom be your guide.

Not here for high and holy things
we render thanks to thee,
but for the common things of earth,
the purple pageantry
of dawning and of dying days,
the splendor of the sea,
the royal robes of autumn moors,
the golden gates of spring,
the velvet of soft summer nights,
the silver glistering
of all the million million stars,
the silent song they sing,
of faith and hope and love undimmed,
undying still through death,
the resurrection of the world,
what time there comes the breath
of dawn that rustles through the trees,
and that clear voice that saith:
Awake, awake to love and work!
The lark is in the sky,
the fields are wet with diamond dew,
the worlds awake to cry
their blessings on the Lord of life,
as he goes meekly by.
Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,
shout with their shout of praise;
see how the giant sun soars up,
great lord of years and days!
So let the love of Jesus come
and set thy soul ablaze,
to give and give, and give again,
what God hath given thee;
to spend thyself nor count the cost;
to serve right gloriously
the God who gave all worlds that are,
and all that are to be.

Not here, as to the prophet’s eye,
The Lord upon His throne appears;
Nor seraphim responsive cry,
“Holy! thrice holy!" in our ears:
Yet God is present in this place,
Veiled in serener majesty;
So full of glory, truth and grace,
That faith alone such light can see.
Nor, as He in the temple taught,
Is Christ within these walls revealed,
When blind, and deaf, and dumb were brought,
Lepers and lame, and all were healed:
Yet here, when two or three shall meet
Or thronging multitudes are found,
All may sit down at Jesus’ feet,
And hear from Him the joyful sound.
Send forth the seraphim, O Lord,
To touch Thy servants’ lips with fire;
Savior, give them Thy faithful Word;
Come, Holy Ghost, their hearts inspire.

Not I, but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted;
Not I, but Christ, be seen be known, be heard;
Not I, but Christ, in every look and action,
Not I, but Christ, in every thought and word.
Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow,
Not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear;
Not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden,
Not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.
Christ, only Christ! no idle words e’er falling,
Christ, only Christ; no needless bustling sound;
Christ, only Christ; no self important bearing;
Christ, only Christ; no trace of “I" be found.
Not I, but Christ, my every need supplying,
Not I, but Christ, my strength and health to be;
Not I, but Christ, for body, soul, and spirit,
Christ, only Christ, here and eternally.

Not in dumb resignation
We lift our hands on high;
Not like the nerveless fatalist
Content to trust and die;
Our faith springs like the eagle,
That soars to meet the sun;
And cries exultingly to Thee,
“O Lord, Thy will be done!"
Thy will! It strengthens weakness,
It bids the strong be just;
No lip to fawn, no hand to beg,
No brow to seek the dust;
Wherever man oppresses man
Beneath Thy liberal sun,
O Lord, be there,
Thine arm made bare,
Thy righteous will be done!

I know this earthly house shall fall,
But on that golden strand
I have a bright and blissful home,
A house not made with hands.
I’ve a house not made with hands,
I’ve a house not made with hands,
I’ve a house not made with hands;
I’ve a house not made with hands,
Over on that golden strand,
I’ve a house not made with hands.
There peace and joy fore’er shall stay,
And there, so fair, there stands,
Where shines one bright eternal day,
My house not made with hands.
No pain or sorrow e’er shall come,
We’ll clasp no parting hands,
And death shall never blight that home,
My house not made with hands.
And when this earthly house shall fall
I’ll answer God’s commands,
And find my home forevermore,
A house not made with hands.

Jesus prayed in the garden and poured out His heart for me
There has been no love shown my mortal as in dark Gethsemane
He could have chosen not to suffer treatment of the cruelest kind
But the lips of my pure savior uttered not my will but thine 
Let me tell you what He went through
You know He really didn't have to
He could have easily just walked away
Then He said "not my will but thine" 
Well they took them and they beat Him and they mocked Him and teased Him
The people kept a cryin "We gotta crucify Him"
"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"
Yet He said "not my will but thine" 
Well they hung Him there in anger searchin' for some relief
They nailed Him there in public right between the two thiefs
He tasted human torture of the cruelest kind
But yet He said "not my will but thine" 
Some were laughin', some were cryin' some were happy at His dyin'
I don't see, I can't see how could this ever be?
Poor Jesus as He hung on the tree He said
"Not my will but thine" 
Not my will but thine

Not now, but in the coming years,
It may be in the better land,
We'll read the meaning of our tears,
And there, some time, we'll understand.
Then trust in God through all the days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Some time, some time we'll understand.
We'll catch the broken thread again,
And finish what we here began;
Heav'n will the mysteries explain,
And then, ah then, we'll understand.
We'll know why clouds instead of sun
Were over many a cherished plan;
Why song has ceased when scarce begun;
探is there, some time, we'll understand.
God knows the way, He holds the key,
He guides us with unerring hand;
Some time with tearless eyes we'll see;
Yes, there, up there, we'll understand.

Not now, my child, a little more rough tossing,
A little longer on the billows’ foam;
A few more journeyings in the desert darkness,
And then, the sunshine of thy Father’s home!
Not now, for I have wand’rers in the distance,
And thou must call them in with patient love;
Not now, for I have sheep upon the mountain,
And thou must follow them where’er they rove.
Not now; for I have loved ones sad and weary;
Wilt thou not cheer them with a kindly smile?
Sick ones, who need thee in their lonely sorrow;
Wilt thou not tend them yet a little while?
Not now, for wounded hearts are sorely bleeding
And thou must teach those widowed hearts to sing:
Not now; for orphans’ tears are quickly falling,
They must be gathered ’neath some sheltering wing.
Go, with the Name of Jesus, to the dying,
And speak that Name in all its living power;
Why should thy fainting heart grow chill and weary?
Canst thou not watch with Me one little hour?
One little hour! and then the glorious crowning,
The golden harp-strings, and the victor’s palm;
One little hour! and then the hallelujah!
Eternity’s long, deep thanksgiving psalm!

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
No riches of earth could have saved my poor soul;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour now maketh me whole.
I am redeemed, but not with silver;
I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price, the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour alone could atone.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The holy commandment forbade me draw near;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour removeth my fear.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The way into heaven could not thus be bought;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour redemption hath wrought.

Not so in haste my heart!
Have faith in God, and wait;
Although He linger long,
He never comes too late.
He never cometh late;
He knoweth what is best;
Vex not thyself in vain;
Until He cometh, rest.
Until He cometh, rest,
Nor grudge the hours that roll;
The feet that wait for God
Are soonest at the goal.
Are soonest at the goal
That is not gained with speed;
Then hold thee still, my heart,
For I shall wait His lead.

Not to the terrors of the Lord,
The tempest, fire, and smoke;
Not to the thunder of that word
Which God on Sinai spoke;
But we are come to Sion’s hill,
The city of our God,
Where milder words declare His will,
And spread His love abroad.
Behold th’innumerable host
Of angels clothed in light!
Behold the spirits of the just,
Whose faith is turned to sight!
Behold the blessed assembly there
Whose names are writ in Heav’n!
And God, the Judge of all, declares
Their vilest sins forgiv’n.
The saints on earth and all the dead
But one communion make;
All join in Christ their living Head,
And of His grace partake.
In such society as this
My weary soul would rest:
The man that dwells where Jesus is
Must be forever blessed.

Not unto us, O Lord of Heav’n,
But unto Thee be glory given;
In love and truth Thou dost fulfill
The counsels of Thy sovereign will;
Though nations fail Thy pow’r to own,
Yet Thou dost reign, and Thou alone.
The idol gods of heathen lands
Are but the work of human hands;
They cannot see, they cannot speak,
Their ears are deaf, their hands are weak;
Like them shall be all those who hold
To gods of silver and of gold.
Let Israel trust in God alone,
The Lord Whose grace and pow’r are known;
To Him your full allegiance yield,
And He will be your Help and Shield;
All those who fear Him God will bless,
His saints have proved His faithfulness.
All ye that fear Him and adore,
The Lord increase you more and more;
Both great and small who Him confess,
You and your children He will bless.
Yea, we will ever bless His Name;
Praise ye the Lord, His praise proclaim.
The heavens are God’s since time began,
But He has given the earth to man;
The dead praise not the living God,
But we will sound His praise abroad,
Yea, we will ever bless His Name;
Praise ye the Lord, His praise proclaim.

Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art;
That, that alone can be my soul's true rest;
Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart,
And stills the tempest of my tossing breast.
Thy Name is Love! I hear it from yon cross;
Thy Name is Love! I read it in yon tomb;
All meaner love is perishable dross,
But this shall light me thro' time's thickest gloom.
It blesses now, and shall forever bless:
It saves me now, and shall forever save;
It holds me up in days of helplessness,
It bears me safely o'er each swelling wave.
'Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God,
That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song;
Thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod;
Leaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong.
More of Thyself, oh, show me, hour by hour;
More of Thy glory, O my God and Lord;
More of Thyself in all Thy grace and pow'r;
More of Thy love and truth, Incarnate Word.

Not what these hands have done
can save this guilty soul,
not what this toiling flesh has borne
can make my spirit whole.
Not what I feel or do
can give me peace with God;
not all my prayers, and sighs, and tears
can bear my aweful load.
Thy work alone, O Christ,
can ease this weight of sin;
Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,
can give me peace within.
Thy love to me, O God,
not mine, O Lord, to Thee,
can rid me of this dark unrest,
and set my spirit free.
Thy grace alone, O God,
to me can pardon speak;
Thy power alone, O Son of God,
can this sore bondage break.
I bless the Christ of God,
I rest on love divine,
and with unfaltering lip and heart,
I call this Saviour mine.

Nothing between my soul and my Savior,
Naught of this world’s delusive dream;
I have renounced all sinful pleasure;
Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.
Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem;
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there’s nothing between.
Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved, there’s nothing between.
Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self denial,
I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.

Nothing but Christ, as on we tread,
The Gift unpriced— God's living Bread,
With staff in hand and feet well-shod,
Nothing but Christ— the Christ of God;
Ev'rything loss for Him below,
Taking the cross where'er we go;
Showing to all, where once He trod,
Nothing but Christ— the Christ of God;
Nothing save Him, in all our ways,
Giving the theme for ceaseless praise;
Our whole resource along the road,
Nothing but Christ— the Christ of God; 

Nothing but leaves! The Spirit grieves
O’er years of wasted life;
O’er sins indulged while conscience slept,
O’er vows and promises unkept,
And reap, from years of strife—
Nothing but leaves!
Nothing but leaves!
Nothing but leaves! No gathered sheaves
Of life’s fair rip’ning grain:
We sow our seeds; lo! tares and weeds,
Words, idle words, for earnest deeds—
Then reap, with toil and pain,
Nothing but leaves!
Nothing but leaves!
Nothing but leaves! Sad mem’ry weaves
No veil to hide the past;
And as we trace our weary way,
And count each lost and misspent day,
We sadly find at last—
Nothing but leaves!
Nothing but leaves!
Ah, who shall thus the Master meet,
And bring but withered leaves?
Ah, who shall, at the Savior’s feet,
Before the awful judgment seat,
Lay down, for golden sheaves,
Nothing but leaves!
Nothing but leaves!

Love gave Him a lowly birth
Love kept Him on the earth
His love was made for you and me
Love made Him a mortal man
But His Father had a plan
His love would nail Him to a tree
Jesus is nothin' but love
He was sent from above
Jesus is love (Jesus is love)
Jesus is nothin' but love
Jesus is nothin' but love
Jesus, He is love
Once I was lost in sin
My Jesus took me in
His love has set me free yeah
Even though I'm a mortal man
I'm part of a greater plan
God gave salvation to me
He gave the love, He paid the price
He rose again, His name is Jesus Christ
Jesus, He is love

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
This is all my hope and peace,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Now by this I’ll overcome—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
Now by this I’ll reach my home—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Glory! Glory! This I sing—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
All my praise for this I bring—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

At God’s perfect timing
Christ died for fallen man.
He wore a crown of thorns,
Nails driven through His hands.
Christ willingly endured it,
To death He chose to go.
He broke His body for us,
Shed blood to make us whole.
Nothing can I boast in,
My life is scarred with sin.
My works are filthy rags,
No merit can I bring.
Yet mercy filled Christ’s heart,
Love took Him to the tree.
It’s grace alone which saves me;
Christ’s blood that sets me free.
So if I am to boast,
I’ll speak of my disgrace.
For my weak self displays
The power of God’s grace.
Christ’s Spirit works within me,
In weakness He is strong.
So I look to my Savior
To safely bring me home.
Nothing can I boast in,
My life is scarred with sin.
My works are filthy rags,
No merit can I bring.
Yet mercy filled Christ’s heart,
Love took Him to the tree.
It’s grace alone which saves me;
Christ’s blood that sets me free.

Nothing in the world will outlast or surpass my calling
Nothing in the world, on the earth, can be worth me falling from
Everything I am, that He wills, He instills within me
No, there is nothing in the world 
I've become through Him what I know every person wants to be:
Loved and free
Free to see my life really count and do more than just get by
I've learned to fly
Through His heavenly way 
I've learned from Him why the world turns
And how my life should be my destiny
Though it's not all bright, when I'm faced with the dark and cloudy skies
Comes a big surprise
When He's leading the way 
You cured my loneliness; I know You
You brought me happiness, loving You
You really turned my life around
Everything I've found in You 
Loving you.
No, there is nothing in the world 
(Spoken with in background):
Lord, there is nothing in the world that compares with You
Nothing in the world that can change a life the way You have mine
I owe my all to You, I give my all to You
And nothing can seperate me from the love that You give 

Where could I go
Where could I run
Even if I found the strength to fly
And if I rose on the wings of the dawn
And crashed through the corner of the sky
If I sailed past the edge of the sea
Even if I made my bed in hell, still there You would find me
Nothing is beyond You
You stand beyond the reach
Of our vain imaginations - our misguided piety
The heavens stretch to hold You and deep cries out to deep
Saying that, "Nothing is beyond You, nothing is beyond You"
Time cannot contain You - You fill eternity
Sin can never stain You - death has lost its sting
I cannot explain the way You came to love me
Except to say that nothing is beyond You, nothing is beyond You
If I should shrink back from the light
So I can sink into the dark
If I take cover and I close my eyes
Even then You would see my heart
You'd cut through all my pain and rage
The darkness is not dark to You, night's as bright as day

Your sacrifice is brokenness
A heart that's full of tenderness,
Come and break me, Lord.
To see You in Your righteousness,
To find You in Your holiness,
Come and take me, Lord.
That I can learn to trust You,
And every way to love You;
Strip away all that remains,
For Your glory and Your name,
'Til there's nothing left of me.
Burn the kingdoms I have made,
You will shine and I will fade,
'Til there's nothing left of me,
'Til there's nothing left of me.
Your Spirit is the only one
That can conform me to Your Son,
Let Him move in me.
Your grace is written deep in me,
You sign my heart so pure as He,
With Your holy blood.

Well there's nothing like the feeling of harmony
Singing with my brothers as they sing with me
Liftin' up our praises to the King of kings
No there's nothing like feeling of harmony
We might not be in the building or going door to door
We might not have our Sunday suits and praise the Lord
We hope you like the music, but pray there's something more
Liftin' up our voices singing one accord
No there's nothing like the feeling of harmony
Singing with my brothers as they sing with me
Liftin' up our praises to the King of kings
You know there's nothing like feeling of harmony
You might prefer tradition or a soulful hymn
You might not like percussion nor to say "Amen"
But if the Lord is liften won't you join on in
And help us sing the once again

Now all the woods are sleeping,
And night and stillness creeping
O’er city, man, and beast;
But thou, my heart, awake thee,
To prayer awhile betake thee,
And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.
My Jesus, stay Thou by me,
And let no foe come nigh me,
Safe sheltered by Thy wing;
But would the foe alarm me,
O let him never harm me,
But still Thine angels round me sing!
My loved ones, rest securely,
From every peril surely
Our God will guard your heads;
And happy slumbers send you,
And bid His hosts attend you,
And golden armed watched o’er your beds.

Now are the days fulfilled,
God’s Son is manifested,
Now His great majesty
In human flesh is vested.
Behold the mighty God,
By Whom all wrath is stilled,
The woman’s promised Seed—
Now are the days fulfilled.
Now are the days fulfilled,
Lo, Jacob’s Star is shining;
The gloomy night has fled
Wherein the world lay pining.
Now, Israel, look on Him
Who long thy heart hath thrilled;
Hear Zion’s watchmen cry:
Now are the days fulfilled.
Now are the days fulfilled,
The child of God rejoices;
No bondage of the Law,
No curses that it voices,
Can fill our hearts with fear;
On Christ our hope we build.
Behold the Prince of Peace—
Now are the days fulfilled.

Now be my heart inspired to sing
The glories of my Savior King,
Jesus the Lord; how heav’nly fair
His form! how bright His beauties are!
O’er all the sons of human race
He shines with a superior grace;
Love from His lips divinely flows,
And blessings all His state compose.
Dress Thee in arms, most mighty Lord,
Gird on the terror of Thy sword,
In majesty and glory ride,
With truth and meekness at Thy side.
Thine anger, like a pointed dart,
Shall pierce the foes of stubborn heart;
Or words of mercy, kind and sweet,
Shall melt the rebels at Thy feet.
Thy throne, O God, for ever stands,
Grace is the scepter in Thy hands;
Thy laws and works are just and right,
Justice and grace are Thy delight.
God, Thine own God, has richly shed
His oil of gladness on Thy head,
And with His sacred Spirit blest
His firstborn Son above the rest.

Now be the Gospel banner
In every land unfurled,
And be the shout, Hosanna!
Re-echoed through the world;
Till every isle and nation,
Till every tribe and tongue,
Receive the great salvation,
And join the happy throng.
What though the embattled legions,
Of earth and hell combine,
His arm throughout their regions
Shall soon resplendent shine;
Ride on, O Lord, victorious,
Immanuel, Prince of Peace,
Thy triumph shall be glorious,
Thy empire still increase.
Yes, Thou shalt reign forever,
O Jesus, King of kings,
Thy light, Thy love, Thy favor,
Each ransomed captive sings;
The isles for Thee are waiting,
The deserts learn Thy praise;
The hills and valleys greeting,
The song responsive raise.

Now before Thee, Lord, we gather
To receive Thy precious Word;
Let Thy grace in showers, O Father,
On our parched hearts be poured.
Send Thy Holy Spirit o’er us,
With Thy quick’ning fire restore us,
At Thy table spread before us
Fill our hung’ring souls, dear Lord.
May Thy Word, to us now given,
Be retained in hearts contrite;
On the narrow way to Heaven
Lead us in Thy perfect light.
Hush, within us, all commotion,
Silence each disturbing notion;
May we, Lord, with true devotion
Use this hour of grace aright.
Of the time may we avail us,
When to seek us Thou art near;
Soon the day of grace may fail us,
And no message more we hear.
Turn our minds to meditation
On our need of Thy salvation;
Urge on all Thine invitation—
To our prayer incline Thine ear.

Now begin the heavenly race—
The Savior calls today;
Let us early seek His face,
And early learn to pray.
Hand in hand we’ll journey on,
Reaching forward to the prize,
Hoping, trusting in the Lord,
Where all our vigor lies.
He Who left His Father’s throne,
To suffer, bleed and die,
He Who made our grief his own,
Will every want supply.
They who on His Name believe,
And patiently endure,
Life eternal shall receive,
And find His mercy sure.
Now begin the heavenly race,
No more, no more delay;
To the healing fount of grace,
Rejoicing, haste away.

Now begin the heav’nly theme,
Sing aloud in Jesus’ Name;
Ye, who His salvation prove,
Triumph in redeeming love.
Ye, who see the Father’s grace
Beaming in the Savior’s face,
As to Canaan on ye move,
Praise and bless redeeming love.
Mourning souls, dry up your tears,
Banish all your guilty fears,
See your guilt and curse remove,
Canceled by redeeming love.
Ye, alas! who long have been
Willing slaves to death and sin,
Now from bliss no longer rove,
Stop and taste redeeming love.
Welcome all by sin oppressed,
Welcome to His sacred rest;
Nothing brought Him from above,
Nothing but redeeming love.
When His Spirit leads us home,
When we to His glory come,
We shall all the fullness prove,
Of our Lord’s redeeming love.
Hither then your music bring,
Strike aloud each cheerful string;
Mortals join the host above,
Join to praise redeeming love.

Now blessed be the Lord our God,
The God of Israel.
For He alone doth wondrous works
In glory that excel.
His wide dominion shall extend
From sea to shining sea,
And unto earth’s remotest bounds
His peaceful rule shall be.
Yea, all the kings shall bow to Him,
His rule all nations hail;
He will regard the poor man’s cry
When other helpers fail.
And blessed be His glorious Name
To all eternity;
The whole earth let His glory fill,
Amen, so let it be.

Now blessing, honor, glory, praise
By angels hosts are sung;
The Church below her voice doth raise
To join the heavenly throng.
Adored be He Who comes to bless
The nations with His love,
To show His truth and righteousness,
And every cloud remove.
Blessed be He Who comes to reign
In Zion’s happy land!
Jerusalem is built again,
And shall forever stand.
No more His kingdom shall decay;
No more the temple fall;
Here Jerusalem reigns with endless sway,
The King and Lord of all.

Now from the altar of my heart
Let incense flames arise;
Assist me, Lord, to offer up
Mine evening sacrifice.
Awake, my love! Awake, my joy!
Awake, my heart and tongue!
Sleep not: when mercies loudly call,
Break forth into a song.
This day God was my Sun and Shield,
My Keeper and my Guide;
His care was on my frailty shown,
His mercies multiplied.
Minutes and mercies multiplied
Have made up all this day;
Minutes came quick but mercies were
More fleet and free than they.
New time, new favor, and new joys
Do a new song require;
Till I shall praise Thee as I would,
Accept my heart’s desire.
Man’s life’s a book of history,
The leaves thereof are days,
The letters mercies closely joined,
The title is Thy praise.
Lord of my time, Whose hand hath set
New time upon my score,
Then I shall praise for all my time,
When time shall be no more.

“Now from the roaring lion’s rage,
O Lord, protect Thy Son,
Nor leave Thy darling to engage
The powers of hell alone."
Thus did our suffering Savior pray
With mighty cries and tears;
God heard Him in that dreadful day,
And chased away His fears.
Great was the victory of His death,
His throne exalted high;
And all the kindreds of the earth
Shall worship or shall die.
A numerous offspring must arise
From His expiring groans;
They shall be reckoned in His eyes
For daughters and for sons.
The meek and humble souls shall see
His table richly spread;
And all that seek the Lord shall be
With joys immortal fed.
The isles shall know the righteousness
Of our incarnate God,
And nations yet unborn profess
Salvation in His blood.

Now from the world withdrawn,
For fellowship with Thee;
May each, O Lord, before Thy throne,
From earthly cares be free.
Possess our every thought,
And teach our minds to pray;
Help us to worship as we ought,
And thus conclude the day.
Our strength may we renew,
And lift our hearts above;
That, while life’s journey we pursue,
We still may walk in love.
Then, in our latter end,
If death shall close our eyes,
Thy mercy will our souls attend,
And bear them to the skies.

Now God be with us, for the night is closing:
The light and darkness are of His disposing,
And ’neath His shadow here to rest we yield us,
For He will shield us.
Let evil thoughts and spirits flee before us;
Till morning cometh, watch, O Master, o’er us;
In soul and body Thou from harm defend us,
Thine angels send us.
Let holy thoughts be ours when sleep o’ertakes us,
Our earliest thoughts be Thine when morning wakes us,
All day serve Thee, in all that we are doing,
Thy praise pursuing.
As Thy beloved, soothe the sick and weeping,
And bid the prisoner lose his griefs in sleeping;
Widows and orphans, we to Thee commend them,
Do Thou befriend them.
We have no refuge, none on earth to aid us,
Save Thee, O Father, Who Thine own hast made us;
But Thy dear presence will not leave them lonely
Who seek Thee only.
Father, Thy Name be praised, Thy kingdom given,
Thy will be done on earth as ’tis in Heaven;
Keep us in life, forgive our sins, deliver
Us now and ever!

Now hail we our Redeemer,
Eternal Son of God,
Born in the flesh to save us,
And cleanse us in His blood.
The Morning Star ascendeth,
Light to the world He lendeth,
Our Guide in grief and gloom.
A man, of God begotten,
Brought in the age of grace;
Lo, all the earth is radiant
With light, and hope, and peace.
Our prison He demolished,
Death’s power He abolished,
And opened Heaven’s gate.
O Jesus, grant us mercy,
And grace on us bestow,
To walk by Thine own guidance,
Thy saving truth to know.
For Thee our hearts are yearning,
From worldly pleasures turning
Unto Thy righteousness.
Into Thy hand the Father
Gave all, that we might be
In bonds of faith united,
And dedicate to Thee,
A people through Thy merit
Entitled to inherit
Thy realm eternally.

Jesus, my Lord will love me forever,
From Him no pow'r of evil can sever,
He gave His life to ransom my soul;
Now I belong to Him; 
Now I belong to Jesus,
Jesus belongs to me,
Not for the years of time alone,
But for eternity.
Once I was lost in sin's degradation,
Jesus came down to bring me salvation,
Lifted me up from sorrow and shame,
Now I belong to Him; 
Now I belong to Jesus,
Jesus belongs to me,
Not for the years of time alone,
But for eternity.
Joy floods my soul for Jesus has saved me,
Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me
His precious blood, He came to redeem,
Now I belong to Him; 
Now I belong to Jesus,
Jesus belongs to me,
Not for the years of time alone,
But for eternity.

I had nothing but heartaches and trouble,
I was seeking for fortune and fame.
I had nothing but doubts and con fusion,
But now I have every thing.
Every thing I need to make me happy, 
I have Jesus to show me the way.
He has saved me and He gave me life eternal,
And now I have every thing.
I was making big plans for my future,
I was living my lifetime in vain.
Then I prayed for life's only meaning,
And now I have everything.

Now I have found the firm foundation
Which holds mine anchor ever sure;
’Twas laid before the world’s creation
In Christ my Savior’s wounds secure;
Foundation which unmoved shall stay
When Heav’n and earth will pass away.
It is that mercy never ending
Which human wisdom far transcends,
Of Him Who, loving arms extending,
To wretched sinners condescends;
Whose heart with pity still doth break
Whether we seek Him or forsake.
Our ruin God hath not intended,
For our salvation He hath yearned;
For this His Son to earth descended
And then to Heav’n again returned;
For this so patient evermore
He knocketh at our heart’s closed door.
O depth of love, to me revealing
The sea where my sins disappear!
In Christ my wounds find perfect healing,
There is no condemnation here;
For Jesus’ blood through earth and skies
Forever “Mercy! Mercy!" cries.
I never will forget this crying;
In faith I’ll trust it all my days,
And when o’er all my sins I’m sighing,
Into the Father’s heart I’ll gaze;
For there is always to be found
Free mercy without end and bound.
Though I be robbed of every pleasure
That makes my soul and body glad
And be deprived of earthly treasure
And be forsaken, lone, and sad,
Though my desire for help seem vain,
His mercy shall with me remain.
Though earthly trials should oppress me
And cares from day to day increase;
Though earth’s vain things should sore distress me
And rob me of my Savior’s peace;
Though I be brought down to the dust,
Still in His mercy I will trust.
When all my deeds I am reviewing,
The deeds that I admire the most,
I find in all my thought and doing
That there is naught whereof to boast.
Yet this sweet comfort shall abide—
In mercy I can still confide.
Let mercy cause me to be willing
To bear my lot and not to fret.
While He my restless heart is stilling,
May I His mercy not forget!
Come weal, come woe, my heart to test,
His mercy is my only rest.
I’ll stand upon this firm foundation
As long as I on earth remain;
This shall engage my meditation
While I the breath of life retain;
And then, when face to face with Thee,
I’ll sing of mercy, great and free.

Now I have found the ground wherein
Sure my soul’s anchor may remain,
The wounds of Jesus, for my sin
Before the world’s foundation slain;
Whose mercy shall unshaken stay,
When Heaven and earth are fled away.
Father, Thine everlasting grace
Our scanty thought surpasses far;
Thy heart still melts with tenderness,
Thy arms of love still open are,
Returning sinners to receive,
That mercy they may taste and live.
O Love, Thou bottomless abyss,
My sins are swallowed up in Thee!
Covered is my unrighteousness,
Nor spot of guilt remains on me,
While Jesus’ blood, through earth and skies,
Mercy, free, boundless mercy, cries.
By faith I plunge me in this sea,
Here is my hope, my joy, my rest;
Hither, when hell assails, I flee,
I look into my Savior’s breast;
Away, sad doubt, and anxious fear!
Mercy is all that’s written there.
Though waves and storms go o’er my head,
Though strength, and health, and friends be gone,
Though joys be withered all and dead,
Though every comfort be withdrawn,
On this my steadfast soul relies,
Father, Thy mercy never dies.
Fixed on this ground will I remain,
Though my heart fail, and flesh decay;
This anchor shall my soul sustain,
When earth’s foundations melt away;
Mercy’s full power I then shall prove,
Loved with an everlasting love.

Now, in a song of grateful praise,
To my dear Lord my voice I’ll raise;
With all His saints I’ll join to tell—
My Jesus has done all things well.
Dear Jesus is the One I love,
Oh, bless His Name! He died for me;
His blood now cleanses me from sin,
Dear Jesus now He sets me free.
All worlds His glorious power confess,
His wisdom all His works express;
But oh! His love what tongue can tell?
My Jesus has done all things well.
How sovereign, powerful and free
Has been His love to sinful me!
He plucked me from the jaws of hell—
My Jesus has done all things well.

Now in holy celebration
sing we of that Mother blest,
in whose flesh for men's salvation
God incarnate deigned to rest,
when a kindred salutation
named in faith the mystic Guest.
Lo, the advent Word confessing,
spake for joy the voice yet dumb,
through his mother's lips addressing
her, of motherhood the sum,--
bower of beauty, blest and blessing,
crowned with fruit of life to come.
"Whence," she cried, at that fair meeting,
"comes to me this great reward?
For when I first heard the greeting
of the Mother of my Lord,
in my womb, the joy repeating,
leapt my babe in sweet accord!"
Lo, at that glad commendation
joy found voice, in Mary's breast
while in holy exultation
she her Maker's power confessed,
at whose word each generation
now henceforward names her blest.
Triune Godhead, health supplying,
Ruler of eternity,
on the fount of grace relying,
we uplift our hearts to thee,
praying that in realms undying
we at one with Life may be.

Now in the days of youth,
When life flows fresh and free,
Thou Lord of all our hearts and lives,
We give ourselves to Thee;
Our fervent gift receive,
And fit us to fulfill,
Through all our days, in all our ways,
Our heavenly Father’s will.
Teach us where’er we live,
To act as in Thy sight,
And do what Thou wouldst have us do
With radiant delight;
Not choosing what is great,
Nor spurning what is small,
But taking from Thy hands our tasks
To glorify them all.
Teach us to love the true,
The beautiful and pure,
And let us not for one short hour
An evil thought endure.
And give us grace to stand
Decided, brave, and strong,
The lovers of all holy things,
The foes of all things wrong.
Spirit of Christ, do Thou
Our first bright days inspire,
That we may live the life of love
And loftiest desire;
And be by Thee prepared
For larger years to come;
And for the life ineffable,
Within the Father’s home.

Now is the healing time decreed
For sins of heart, of word or deed,
When we in humble fear record
The wrong that we have done the Lord.
Who, always merciful and good,
Has borne so long our wayward mood,
Nor cut us off unsparingly
In our so great iniquity.
Therefore with fasting and with prayer,
Our secret sorrow we declare;
With all good striving seek His face,
And lowly hearted plead for grace.
Cleanse us, O Lord, from every stain,
Help us the meed of praise to gain,
Till with the angels linked in love
Joyful we tread Thy courts above.
Father and Son and Spirit blest,
To Thee be every prayer addrest,
Who art in threefold Name adored,
From age to age, the only Lord.

Now Israel may say, and that in truth,
If that the Lord had not our right maintained,
If that the Lord had not with us remained,
When cruel men against us rose to strive,
We surely had been swallowed up alive.
Yea, when their wrath against us fiercely rose,
The swelling tide had o’er us spread its wave,
The raging stream had then become our grave,
The surging flood, in proudly swelling roll,
Most surely then had overwhelmed our soul.
Blest be the Lord, Who made us not their prey;
As from the snare a bird escapeth free,
Their net is rent and so escaped are we;
Our only help is in God’s holy Name,
Who made the earth and all the heavenly frame.

Now Israel’s hope in triumph ends,
With angels’ glorious song ascends
A star of heavenly splendor.
O’er Bethlehem it shineth bright,
All people guided by its light,
Shall come and homage render.
Great light, bright light,
Now descendeth, darkness endeth,
Day beginneth;
Light to all the world it bringeth.
Among us dwells in truth and grace
The hidden God, who loves our race;
He brought us all salvation.
The glory of the Son we see,
The only Son’s true majesty,
And bow in adoration.
Draw near and hear,
Every nation now salvation
God bestoweth.
And His love and mercy showeth.
Rejoice, my soul, and bless His Name
Who to the lost and fallen came
To open Heaven’s portals.
Rejoice that God will mercy show,
The broken covenant renew
With us poor sinful mortals.
Now be glory
Ever given God in Heaven;
Peace unending
Be to earth from Heaven descending.

Now let all loudly sing praise to God the Lord;
Christendom, proudly laud Him with one accord,
Gently He bids thee come before Him;
Haste, then, O Israel, now adore Him;
Haste, then, O Israel, now adore Him.
For the Lord reigneth over the universe;
All He sustaineth, all things His praise rehearse,
The angel host His glory telling,
Psalter and harp are the anthem swelling;
Psalter and harp are the anthem swelling.
Come, heathen races, cast off all grief and care,
For pleasant places your Savior doth prepare,
Where His blest Word abroad is sounded,
Pardon for sinners and grace unbounded;
Pardon for sinners and grace unbounded.
Richly He feeds us always and everywhere;
Gently He leads us with a true father’s care;
The late and early rains He sends us,
Daily His blessing, His love, attends us,
Daily His blessing, His love, attends us.
Sing we His praises Who is thus merciful;
Christendom raises songs to His glorious rule.
Rejoice! No foe shall now alarm us;
He will protect us, and who can harm us?
He will protect us, and who can harm us?

Now let our cheerful eyes survey
Our great High Priest above,
And celebrate His constant care,
And sympathetic love.
Though raised to a superior throne,
Where angels bow around,
And high o’er all the shining train,
With matchless honors crowned—
The names of all His saints He bears
Engraven on His heart;
Nor shall a name once treasured there
E’er from His care depart.
Those characters shall fair abide
Our everlasting trust,
When gems, and monuments, and crowns,
Are moldered down to dust.
So, gracious Savior! on my breast,
May Thy dear Name be worn,
A sacred ornament and guard,
To endless ages borne.

Now let our mournful songs record
The dying sorrows of our Lord,
When He complained in tears and blood,
As one forsaken of his God.
The Jews beheld Him thus forlorn,
And shake their heads, and laugh in scorn:
“He rescued others from the grave;
Now let him try himself to save.
“This is the man did once pretend
God was his Father and his Friend;
If God the blessed loved him so,
Why doth He fail to help him now?"
Barbarous people! cruel priests!
How they stood round like savage beasts!
Like lions gaping to devour,
When God had left Him in their power.
They wound His head, His hands, His feet,
Till streams of blood each other meet;
By lot His garments they divide,
And mock the pangs in which He died.
But God, the Father, heard His cry;
Raised from the dead, He reigns on high;
The nations learn His righteousness,
And humble sinners taste His grace

Now let our souls on wings sublime,
Rise from the vanities of time,
Draw back the parting veil and see,
The glories of eternity.
Born by a new celestial birth,
Why should we grovel here on earth?
Why grasp at transitory toys,
So near to Heav’n’s eternal joys.
Shall aught beguile us on the road,
When we are walking back to God?
For strangers into life we come,
And dying is but going home.
Welcome sweet hour of full discharge,
That sets our longing souls at large.
Unbinds our chains, breaks up our cell,
And gives us with our God to dwell.
To dwell with God, to feel His love,
Is the full Heav’n enjoyed above;
And the sweet expectation now,
Is the young dawn of Heav’n below.

Now let the vault of Heav’n resound
In praise of love that doth abound,
“Christ hath triumphed, alleluia!"
Sing, choirs of angels, loud and clear,
“Christ hath triumphed, Christ hath triumphed!"
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
Eternal is the gift He brings,
Wherefore our heart with rapture sings,
“Christ hath triumphed, Jesus liveth!"
Now doth He come and give us life,
Now doth His presence still all strife
Through His triumph; Jesus reigneth!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
O fill us, Lord, with dauntless love;
Set heart and will on things above
That we conquer through Thy triumph,
Grant grace sufficient for life’s day
That by our life we ever say,
“Christ hath triumphed, and He liveth!"
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
Adoring praises now we bring
And with the heavenly blessed sing,
“Christ hath triumphed, Alleluia!"
Be to the Father, and our Lord,
To Spirit blest, most holy God,
Thine the glory, never ending!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

Now let us all arise and sing
The coming kingdom of our King,
The time when all shall brothers be,
Each loving each, all loving Thee.
How long, O Lord, O Lord, how long
Shall these Thy weak ones suffer wrong?
O when shall dawn the glorious day
For which we hope and work and pray?
Dear Father, use what means Thou wilt
To cleanse our lives from greed and guilt;
Help us to put away our sin
And learn to bring Thy kingdom in.

Now let us come before Him,
With song and prayer adore Him,
Who to our life hath given
All needed strength from Heaven.
The stream of years is flowing,
And we are onward going,
From old to new surviving
And by His mercy thriving.
In woe we often languish
And pass through times of anguish
Of wars and trepidation
Alarming every nation.
As mothers watch are keeping
O’er children who are sleeping,
Their fear and grief assuaging
When angry storms are waging.
So God His own is shielding
And help to them is yielding.
When need and woe distress them,
His loving arms caress them.
O Thou Who dost not slumber,
Remove what would encumber
Our work, which prospers never
Unless Thou bless it ever.
O God of mercy, hear us;
Our Father, be Thou near us;
Mid crosses and in sadness
Be Thou our Fount of gladness.
To all who bow before Thee
And for Thy grace implore Thee,
Oh, grant Thy benediction
And patience in affliction.
Be Thou a Helper speedy
To all the poor and needy,
To all forlorn a Father;
Thine erring children gather.
Be with the sick and ailing,
Their Comforter unfailing;
Dispelling grief and sadness,
Oh, give them joy and gladness!
Above all else, Lord, send us
Thy Spirit to attend us,
Within our hearts abiding,
To Heav’n our footsteps guiding.
All this Thy hand bestoweth,
Thou Life, whence our life floweth.
To all Thy Name confessing
Grant, Lord, Thy New Year’s blessing!

Now let us from this table rise
renewed in body, mind, and soul;
with Christ we die and live again,
his selfless love has made us whole.
With minds alert, upheld by grace,
to spread the word in speech and deed,
we follow in the steps of Christ,
at one with all in hope and need.
To fill each human house with love,
it is the sacrament of care;
the work that Christ began to do
we humbly pledge ourselves to share.
Then grant us courage, Father God,
to choose again the pilgrim way
and help us to accept with joy
the challenge of tomorrow's day.

Now let us join with hearts and tongues,
And emulate the angels’ songs;
Yea, sinners may address their King
In songs that angels cannot sing.
They praise the Lamb Who once was slain,
But we can add a higher strain;
Not only say, “He suffered thus,"
But that He suffered all for us.
When angels by transgression fell,
Justice consigned them all to hell;
But mercy formed a wondrous plan,
To save and honor fallen man.
Jesus, Who passed the angels by,
Assumed our flesh to bleed and die;
And still He makes it His abode,
As man, He fills the throne of God.
Our next of kin, our Brother now,
Is He to Whom the angels bow;
They join with us to praise His Name,
But we the nearest interest claim.
But ah! how faint our praises rise!
Sure, ’tis the wonder of the skies;
That we, who share His richest love,
So cold and unconcerned should prove.
O glorious hour, it comes with speed
When we from sin and darkness freed,
Shall see the God Who died for man,
And praise Him more than angels can.

Now let us see thy beauty, Lord,
As we have seen before;
And by thy beauty quicken us
To love thee and adore.
'Tis easy when with simple mind
Thy loveliness we see,
To consecrate ourselves afresh
To duty and to thee.
Our every feverish mood is cooled,
And gone is every load,
When we can lose the love of self,
And find the love of God.
Lord, it is coming to ourselves
When thus we come to thee;
The bondage of thy loveliness
Is perfect liberty.
So now we come to ask again
What thou hast often given,
The vision of that loveliness
Which is the life of heaven.

Now may He Who from the dead
Brought the Shepherd of the sheep
Jesus Christ, our King and Head,
All our souls in safety keep.
May He teach us to fulfill
What is pleasing in His sight;
Perfect us in all His will,
And preserve us day and night.
To that dear Redeemer’s praise,
Who the covenant sealed with blood,
Let our hearts and voices raise
Loud thanksgivings to our God.

Now may the God of power and grace
Attend His people’s humble cry!
Jehovah hears when Israel prays,
And brings deliverance from on high.
The Name of Jacob’s God defends
Better than shields or brazen walls;
He from His sanctuary sends
Succor and strength, when Zion calls.
Well He remembers our sighs,
His love exceeds our best deserts;
His love accepts the sacrifice
Of humble groans and broken hearts.
In His salvation is our hope,
And in the Name of Israel’s God,
Our troops shall lift their banners up
Our navies spread their flags abroad.
Some trust in horses trained for war,
And some of chariots make their boasts;
Our surest expectations are
From Thee, the Lord of heav’nly hosts.
O may the memory of Thy Name
Inspire our armies for the fight!
Our foes shall fall and die with shame,
Or quit the field with shameful flight.
Now save us, Lord, from slavish fear;
Now let our hopes be firm and strong
Till the salvation shall appear,
And joy and triumph raise the song.

Now, my soul, thy voice upraising,
Tell in sweet and mournful strain
How the Crucified, enduring
Grief, and wounds, and dying pain,
Freely of His love was offered,
Sinless was for sinners slain.
Scourged with unrelenting fury
For the sins which we deplore,
By His livid stripes He heals us,
Raising us to fall no more;
All our bruises gently soothing,
Binding up the bleeding sore.
See! His hands and feet are fastened
So He makes His people free;
Not a wound whence blood is flowing
But a fount of grace shall be;
Yea the very nails which nail Him
Nail us also to the tree.
Through His heart the spear is piercing,
Though His foes have seen Him die;
Blood and water thence are streaming
In a tide of mystery,
Water from our guilt to cleanse us,
Blood to win us crowns on high.
Jesu, may those precious fountains
Drink to thirsting souls afford:
Let them be our cup and healing,
And at length our full reward;
So a ransomed world shall ever
Praise Thee, its redeeming Lord.

Now, my tongue, the mystery telling,
Of the glorious body sing,
And the blood, all price excelling,
Which all mankind’s Lord and King,
In a virgin’s womb once dwelling,
Shed for this world’s ransoming.
Given for us and condescending
To be born for us below,
He, with men in converse blending,
Dwelt the seed of truth to sow,
Till He closed with wondrous ending
His most patient life below.
That last night, at supper lying
’Mid the twelve, His chosen band,
Jesus, with the law complying,
Keeps the feast its rites demand;
Then, more precious food supplying,
Gives Himself with His own hand.
Word made flesh, true bread He maketh
By His word His flesh to be;
Wine His Blood: which whoso taketh
Must from carnal thoughts be free;
Faith alone, though sight forsaketh
Shows true hearts the mystery.
Therefore we, before Him bending,
This great sacrament revere;
Types and shadows have their ending,
For the newer rite is here;
Faith, our outward sense befriending,
Makes our inward vision clear.
Glory let us give, and blessing,
To the Father and the Son;
Honor, might and praise addressing
While eternal ages run,
Ever, too, His love confessing,
Who from Both with Both is One.

Now, on land and sea descending,
Brings the night its peace profound;
Let our vesper hymn be blending
With the holy calm around.
Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
Let our vesper hymn be blending
With the holy calm around.
Soon as dies the sunset glory,
Stars of heaven shine out above,
Telling still the ancient story,
Their Creator’s changeless love.
Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
Telling still the ancient story,
Their Creator’s changeless love.
Now, our wants and burdens leaving
To God’s care Who cares for all,
Cease we fearing, cease we grieving,
Touched by God our burdens fall.
Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
Cease we fearing, cease we grieving,
Touched by God our burdens fall.
As the darkness deepens o’er us
Lo! eternal stars arise;
Hope and faith and love rise glorious,
Shining in the Spirit’s skies.
Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
Hope and faith and love rise glorious,
Shining in the Spirit’s skies.

Now praise we Christ, the Holy One,
The blessed virgin Mary’s Son,
Far as the glorious sun doth shine,
E’en to the world’s remote confine.
He Who Himself all things did make
A servant’s form vouchsafed to take
That He as man mankind might win
And save His creatures from their sin.
The grace and power of God the Lord
Upon the mother was outpoured;
A virgin pure and undefiled
In wondrous wise conceived a Child.
The noble mother bore a Son—
For so did Gabriel’s promise run—
Whom John confessed and leaped with joy
Ere yet the mother knew her Boy.
Upon a manger filled with hay
In poverty content He lay;
With milk was fed the Lord of all,
Who feeds the ravens when they call.
The heavenly choirs rejoice and raise
Their voice to God in songs of praise.
To humble shepherds is proclaimed
The Shepherd Who the world hath framed.
All honor unto Christ be paid,
Pure Offspring of the favored maid,
With Father and with Holy Ghost,
Till time in endless time be lost.

Now praise we great and famous men,
The fathers named in story;
And praise the Lord, Who now as then
Reveals in man His glory.
Praise we the wise and brave and strong,
Who graced their generation,
Who helped the right, and fought the wrong,
And made our folk a nation.
Praise we the great of heart and mind,
The singers sweetly gifted,
Whose music like a mighty wind
The souls of men uplifted.
Praise we the peaceful men of skill,
Who builded homes of beauty,
And, rich in art, made richer still
The brotherhood of duty.
Praise we the glorious names we know,
And they whose names have perished,
Lost, in the haze of long ago,
In silent love be cherished.
In peace their sacred ashes rest,
Fulfilled their day’s endeavor;
They blessed the earth, and they are blessed
Of God and man forever.

Now rest beneath night’s shadow
The woodland, field, and meadow,
The world in slumber lies;
But Thou, my heart, awake thee,
To prayer and song betake thee;
Let praise to thy Creator rise.
The radiant sun hath vanished,
His golden rays are banished
By night, the foe of day;
But Christ, the Sun of gladness,
Dispelling all my sadness,
Within my heart holds constant sway.
The rule of day is over
And shining jewels cover
The heaven’s boundless blue.
Thus I shall shine in heaven,
Where crowns of gold are given
To all who faithful prove and true.
To rest my body hasteth,
Aside its garments casteth,
Types of mortality;
These I put off and ponder
How Christ will give me yonder
A robe of glorious majesty.
Lord Jesus, Who dost love me,
Oh, spread Thy wings above me
And shield me from alarm!
Though evil would assail me,
Thy mercy will not fail me:
I rest in Thy protecting arm.
My loved ones, rest securely,
For God this night will surely
From peril guard your heads.
Sweet slumbers may He send you
And bid His hosts attend you
And through the night watch o’er your beds.

Now sing we, now rejoice,
Now raise to heaven our voice;
He from whom joy streameth
Poor in a manger lies;
Not so brightly beameth
The sun in yonder skies.
Thou my Savior art!
Thou my Savior art! 
Come from on high to me;
I cannot rise to Thee
Cheer my wearied spirit,
O pure and holy Child;
Through Thy grace and merit,
Blest Jesus, Lord most mild,
Draw me unto Thee!
Draw me unto Thee! 
Now through His Son doth shine
The Father's grace divine.
Death o'er us had reigned
Through sin and vanity;
He for us obtained
Eternal joy on high.
May we praise Him there!
May we praise Him there! 
Oh, where shall joy be found?
Where but on heavenly ground?
Where the angels singing
With all His saints unite,
Sweetest praises bringing
In heavenly joy and light.
Oh, that we were there!
Oh, that we were there!

Now sweeping down the years untold,
The day of truth is breaking;
And sweet and fair the leaves unfold,
Of love’s immortal waking.
For flower and fruitage now are seen,
Where blight and mildew rested:
The Christ today to us has been
By word and deed attested.
His living presence we have felt,
The Word made flesh among us:
And hearts of stone before Him melt,
His peace is brooding o’er us.

Now thank we all our God, with heart and hands and voices,
Who wondrous things has done, in Whom this world rejoices;
Who from our mothers’ arms has blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love, and still is ours today.
O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts and blessed peace to cheer us;
And keep us in His grace, and guide us when perplexed;
And free us from all ills, in this world and the next!
All praise and thanks to God the Father now be given;
The Son and Him Who reigns with Them in highest Heaven;
The one eternal God, Whom earth and Heaven adore;
For thus it was, is now, and shall be evermore.

I belong to You
And I'll do what You want me to
You can show the way
That I will follow every day
All my life I needed
A friend to see me through
But I'll not have to worry
Now that I belong to You
Every morn I wake
And every breath of air I take
Reminds me of the time
That You became a friend of mine
All my dreams and visions
Inspiration too
Are given to me gladly
Now that I belong to You
Interlude:
(Every morn I wake)
(All my visions)
(Let it be)
There will come a day (there will come a day)
When I'll have to pass away (when I will have to pass away)
Into a world of bliss
I hope it will be like this (you can make me happy)
You can make me happy
In everything You do (I belong to you)
But I'll not have to worry (worry)
Now that I belong to You
I'll be Yours forever
Now that I belong to You

Now that the day has reached its close,
The sun doth shine no more,
In sleep the toil-worn find repose
And all who wept before.
But Thou, my God, dost never sleep,
For Thou Thyself art Light;
No darkness, howsoever deep,
Can dim Thy perfect sight.
Therefore, O Lord, remember me
Throughout the gloom of night,
Protect Thou me most graciously
And shield me with Thy might.
Keep satan's fury far from me
By many an angel arm;
Then shall I be from worry free
And safe from every harm.
I know the evil I have done
Doth cry aloud to Thee;
But yet in mercy Thy dear Son
Hath full atoned for me.
In Him accepted I shall be
When suppliant at Thy feet,
He is my Surety and my Plea
Before Thy judgment-seat.
And so I close my weary eyes,
Sweet peace within my breast,
Why toss about in fears or sighs?
God watches while I rest.
Should this night prove the last for me
In this sad vale of cares,
Then lead me, Lord, to dwell with Thee
And all Thy chosen heirs.
And thus I live and die to Thee,
Strong Lord of hosts indeed.
In life, in death, deliver me
From every fear and need.

Now that the daylight dies away,
By all Thy grace and love,
Thee, Maker of the world, we pray
To watch our bed above.
Let dreams depart and phantoms fly,
The offspring of the night,
Keep us, like shrines, beneath Thine eye,
Pure in our foe’s despite.
This grace on Thy redeemed confer,
Father, co-equal Son,
And Holy Ghost, the Comforter,
Eternal Three in One.

Now that the daylight fills the sky,
We lift our hearts to God on high,
That He, in all we do or say,
Would keep us free from harm today.
May He restrain our tongues from strife,
And shield from anger’s din our life,
And guard with watchful care our eyes
From earth’s absorbing vanities.
O may our inmost hearts be pure,
From thoughts of folly kept secure,
And pride of sinful flesh subdued
Through sparing use of daily food.
So we, when this day’s work is o’er,
And shades of night return once more,
Our path of trial safely trod,
Shall give the glory to our God.
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
Whom with the Spirit we adore
Forever and forevermore.

Now that the daystar glimmers bright
We suppliantly pray
That He, the uncreated Light,
May guide us on our way.
No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,
Nor thoughts that idly rove,
But simple truth be on our tongue,
And in our hearts be love.
And while the hours in order flow,
O Christ, securely fence
Our gates, beleaguered by the foe,
The gate of every sense.
And grant that to Thine honor, Lord,
Our daily toil may tend;
That we begin it at Thy Word,
And in Thy favor end.
To God the Father glory be,
And to His only Son,
And to the Spirit, One and Three,
While endless ages run

Now that the sun is gleaming bright,
Implore we, bending low,
That He, the uncreated Light
May guide us as we go.
No sinful word, nor deed of wrong
Nor thoughts that idly rove,
But simple truth be on our tongue,
And in our hearts be love.
And while the hours in order flow,
O Christ, securely fence
Our gates, beleaguered by the foe,
The gate of every sense.
And grant that to Thine honor, Lord,
Our daily toil may tend;
That we begin it at Thy Word,
And in Thy favor end.

Now the busy week is done,
Now the rest-time is begun;
Thou hast brought us on our way,
Kept and led us day by day;
Now there comes the first and best,
Day of worship, light and rest.
Hallow, Lord, the coming day!
When we meet to praise and pray,
Hear Thy Word, Thy feast attend,
Hours of happy service spend;
To our hearts be manifest,
Lord of labor and of rest.
For Thy children gone before
We can trust Thee and adore;
All their earthly week is past,
Sabbath-time is theirs at last;
Fold them, Father, to Thy breast,
Give them everlasting rest.
Guide us all the days to come,
Till Thy mercy call us home:
All our powers do Thou employ,
Be Thy work our chiefest joy;
Then, the promised land possessed,
Bid us enter into rest.

Now the day is over,
Night is drawing nigh,
Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.
Now the darkness gathers,
Stars begin to peep,
Birds, and beasts and flowers
Soon will be asleep.
Jesus, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tenderest blessing
May mine eyelids close.
Grant to little children
Visions bright of Thee;
Guard the sailors tossing
On the deep, blue sea.
Comfort those who suffer,
Watching late in pain;
Those who plan some evil
From their sin restrain.
Through the long night watches
May Thine angels spread
Their white wings above me,
Watching round my bed.
When the morning wakens,
Then may I arise
Pure, and fresh, and sinless
In Thy holy eyes.
Glory to the Father,
Glory to the Son,
And to Thee, blest Spirit,
While all ages run.

Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,
Wheat that in the dark earth many years has lain;
Love lives again, that with the dead has been:
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.
In the grave they laid Him, Love Whom we had slain,
Thinking that He’d never wake to life again,
Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen:
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.
Up He sprang at Easter, like the risen grain,
He that for three days in the grave had lain;
Up from the dead my risen Lord is seen:
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.
When our hearts are saddened, grieving or in pain,
By Your touch You call us back to life again;
Fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been:
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.

Now to Heaven our prayer ascending,
God speed the right!
In a noble cause contending,
God speed the right!
May we live our lives before Thee,
Like the good and great in story,
If we fail, we fail in glory:
God speed the right!
Patient, firm, and persevering,
God speed the right!
No event or danger fearing,
God speed the right!
Pains, nor toils, nor trials heeding,
Never from the truth receding,
And in Heaven’s own time succeeding,
God speed the right!
Still our onward course pursuing,
God speed the right!
Every foe at length subduing,
God speed the right!
Truth! thy cause, whate’er delay it,
There’s no power on earth can stay it,
Proudly let us then obey it,
God speed the right!

Now, the hour of worship o’er,
Teaching, hearing, praying, singing,
Let us gladly God adore,
For His Word our praises bringing;
For the rich repast He gave us
Bless the Lord, Who deigned to save us.
Now the blessing cheers our heart,
By His grace to us extended.
Let us joyfully depart;
Be our souls to God commended.
May His Spirit ever guide us
And with all good gifts provide us!
Bless our going out, we pray,
Bless our entrance in like measure;
Bless our bread, O Lord, each day,
Bless our toil, our rest, our pleasure;
Bless us when we reach death’s portal,
Bless us then with life immortal.

Now the king in Thy strength shall be joyful, O Lord,
Thy salvation shall make him rejoice;
For the wish of his heart Thou didst freely accord,
The request of his suppliant voice.
All the blessings of goodness Thou freely didst give;
With the purest of gold he is crowned;
When he asked of Thee life, Thou hast made Him to live
While the ages shall circle around.
Through salvation from Thee has his fame spread abroad
Thou didst glory and honor impart;
Thou hast made him most blessed forever, O God,
And Thy presence has gladdened his heart.
For the king in the strength of Jehovah most high
Did unwavering confidence place;
On the Name of Jehovah he still will rely,
And shall stand evermore in His grace.
By the hand of Thy might and the dread of Thy Name
All Thy foes Thou wilt burn in Thy fire;
Thou wilt swallow them up in the vengeance of flame,
And their race shall succumb to Thine ire.
Thou they plotted their schemes against Thee and Thy might,
In their purpose they cannot succeed;
Thou wilt certainly make them turn backward in flight,
For Thine arrows are ready to speed.
Be Thou then high exalted, Jehovah our God,
And arise in the weight of Thy might;
We shall sing of Thy strength and omnipotent rod;
In Thy praises shall be our delight.

Now the laborer’s task is o’er;
Now the battle day is past;
Now upon the farther shore
Lands the voyager at last.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the tears of earth are dried;
There its hidden things are clear;
There the work of life is tried
By a juster Judge than here.
There the Shepherd, bringing home
Many a lamb forlorn and strayed,
Shelters each, no more to roam,
Where the wolf can ne’er invade.
There the sinful souls, that turn
To the cross their dying eyes,
All the love of Christ shall learn
At His feet in Paradise.
There no more the powers of hell
Can prevail to mar their peace;
Christ the Lord shall guard them well,
He Who died for their release.
“Earth to earth, and dust to dust,"
Calmly now the words we say;
Left behind, we wait in trust
For the resurrection day.

Now the shades of night are gone,
Now the morning light is come.
Lord, may we be Thine today;
Drive the shades of sin away.
Fill our souls with heavenly light,
Banish doubt and cleanse our sight.
In Thy service, Lord, today
Help us labor, help us pray.
Keep our haughty passions bound,
Save us from our foes around;
Going out and coming in,
Keep us safe from every sin.
When our work of life is past;
Oh, receive us then at last!
Night of sin will be no more
When we reach the heavenly shore.

Now the silence, now the peace,
Now the empty hands uplifted;
Now the kneeling, now the plea,
Now the Father’s arms in welcome;
Now the hearing, now the power,
Now the vessel brimmed for pouring;
Now the body, now the blood,
Now the joyful celebration;
Now the wedding, now the songs,
Now the heart forgiven, leaping;
Now the Spirit’s visitation,
Now the Son’s epiphany;
Now the Father’s blessing,
Now, now, now.

Now to God, our Strength and Savior,
Render praise and loudly sing.
In our fathers’ God rejoicing,
All your noblest music bring.
Let the trumpet, far resounding,
This our festal day proclaim,
By our fathers’ God appointed,
When from bondage Israel came.
I, Thy God, removed thy burdens,
When thou calledst, set thee free,
Proved thee in the thirsty desert,
In the thunder answered thee.
O My people, hear My pleadings;
O that thou wouldst hearken now;
No strange worship shalt thou offer,
Nor to idols shalt thou bow.
I am God the Lord Who saved thee,
And from cruel bondage freed;
Open wide thy mouth of longing;
I will satisfy thy need.
But My people would not hearken,
Yea, they would not yield to Me;
So I left them in their blindness,
Their own counselors to be.
If My people would obey Me,
Gladly walking in My ways,
Soon would I, their foes subduing,
Fill their lips with songs of praise.
All the haters of Jehovah
Shall His clemency implore,
And the days of those that love Him
Shall endure forevermore.

Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more
Than all we ask or imagine
According to His power that is at work within us 
Bridge (several times through in round): 
To Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
Throughout all generations,
Forever and ever! Amen.
Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more
Than all we ask or imagine
Yea, with wheat the very finest
I their hunger will supply,
Bid the very rocks yield honey
That shall fully satisfy.

Many are the words we speak
Many are the songs we sing
Many kinds of offerings
But now to live the life
Many are the words we speak
Many are the songs we sing
Many kinds of offerings
But now to live the life
Help us live the life
Help us live the life
All we want to do is bring you something real
Bring You something true
(We hope that) Precious are the words we speak
(We pray that) Precious are the songs we sing
Precious all these offerings
But now to live the life
Help us live the life
Help us live the life
All we want to do is bring you something real
Bring You something true
Help us live the life
Help us live the life
All we want to do is bring you something real
Bring You something true
Now to go the extra mile
Now to turn the other cheek
And to serve You with a life
Let us share your fellowship
Even of your sufferings
Never let the passion die.
Now to live the life.
Now to live the life
Now to live the life
Now to live the life 

Now to the Fountain of Life I am going,
Jesus, I pray Thee, make me Thine.
Wholly thine, wholly Thine,
Seal and keep me Thine;
Wholly thine, wholly Thine,
Keep me wholly Thine.
All I surrender to Thee, O my Savior,
All to Thy sov’reign will divine.
O what a fullness of love He has granted,
O what a rapture, Lord, is mine.
Now I am trusting the words of Thy promise,
Thou hast redeemed me, I am Thine

Now to the Lord a noble song!
Awake, my soul; awake, my tongue;
Hosanna to th’eternal Name,
And all His boundless love proclaim.
See where it shines in Jesus’ face,
The brightest image of His grace;
God, in the person of His Son,
Has all His mightiest works outdone.
The spacious earth and spreading flood
Proclaim the wise and powerful God;
And thy rich glories from afar
Sparkle in every rolling star.
But in His looks a glory stands,
The noblest labor of thine hands;
The pleasing luster of His eyes
Outshines the wonders of the skies.
Grace! ‘tis a sweet, a charming theme;
My thoughts rejoice at Jesus’ Name:
Ye angels, dwell upon the sound!
Ye heav’ns, reflect it to the ground!
O may I live to reach the place
Where he unveils His lovely face!
Where all His beauties you behold,
And sing His Name to harps of gold!

Now to the Lord, that makes us know
The wonders of His dying love,
Be humble honors paid below,
And strains of nobler praise above.
’Twas He that cleansed our foulest sins,
And washed us in His richest blood;
’Tis He that makes us priests and kings,
And brings us rebels near to God.
To Jesus, our atoning Priest,
To Jesus, our superior King,
Be everlasting power confessed,
And every tongue His glory sing.
Behold, on flying clouds He comes,
And every eye shall see Him move;
Though with our sins we pierced Him once,
Then He displays His pard’ning love.
The unbelieving world shall wail,
While we rejoice to see the day:
Come, Lord; nor let Thy promise fail,
Nor let Thy chariots long delay.

Now, my tongue, the mystery telling,
Of the glorious body sing,
And the blood, all price excelling,
Which all mankind’s Lord and King,
In a virgin’s womb once dwelling,
Shed for this world’s ransoming.
Given for us and condescending
To be born for us below,
He, with men in converse blending,
Dwelt the seed of truth to sow,
Till He closed with wondrous ending
His most patient life below.
That last night, at supper lying
’Mid the twelve, His chosen band,
Jesus, with the law complying,
Keeps the feast its rites demand;
Then, more precious food supplying,
Gives Himself with His own hand.
Word made flesh, true bread He maketh
By His word His flesh to be;
Wine His Blood: which whoso taketh
Must from carnal thoughts be free;
Faith alone, though sight forsaketh
Shows true hearts the mystery.
Therefore we, before Him bending,
This great sacrament revere;
Types and shadows have their ending,
For the newer rite is here;
Faith, our outward sense befriending,
Makes our inward vision clear.
Glory let us give, and blessing,
To the Father and the Son;
Honor, might and praise addressing
While eternal ages run,
Ever, too, His love confessing,
Who from Both with Both is One.

Now unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty,
All glory and strength and dominion accord;
Ascribe to Him glory, and render Him honor,
In beauty of holiness worship the Lord.
The voice of Jehovah, the God of all glory,
Rolls over the waters, the thunders awake;
The voice of Jehovah, majestic and mighty,
Is heard, and the cedars of Lebanon break.
His voice makes the mountains and deserts to tremble,
Wild beasts are affrighted, the forests laid bare,
And through all creation, His wonderful temple,
All things He has fashioned His glory declare.
The Lord ruled in might at the flood of great waters,
A King Whose dominion is never to cease;
The Lord will give blessing and strength to His people,
The Lord all His people will comfort with peace.

Not what my hands have done can save my guilty soul;
Not what my toiling flesh has borne can make my spirit whole.
Not what I feel or do can give me peace with God;
Not all my prayers and sighs and tears can bear my awful load.
Your voice alone, O Lord, can speak to me of grace;
Your power alone, O Son of God, can all my sin erase.
No other work but Yours, no other blood will do;
No strength but that which is divine can bear me safely through.
Thy work alone, O Christ, can ease this weight of sin;
Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God, can give me peace within.
Thy love to me, O God, not mine, O Lord, to Thee,
Can rid me of this dark unrest, And set my spirit free.
I bless the Christ of God; I rest on love divine;
And with unfaltering lip and heart I call this Savior mine.
His cross dispels each doubt; I bury in His tomb
Each thought of unbelief and fear, each lingering shade of gloom.
I praise the God of grace; I trust His truth and might;
He calls me His, I call Him mine, My God, my joy and light.
’Tis He Who saveth me, and freely pardon gives;
I love because He loveth me, I live because He lives.
will ever bless His Name;
Praise ye the Lord, His praise proclaim.

Now, when the dusky shades of night, retreating
Before the sun’s red banner, swiftly flee;
Now, when the terrors of the dark are fleeting,
O Lord, we lift our thankful hearts to Thee.
To Thee, Whose Word, the fount of light unsealing,
When hill and dale in thickest darkness lay,
Awoke bright rays across the dim earth stealing,
And bade the even and morn complete the day.
Look from the tower of heaven, and send to cheer us,
Thy light and truth, to guide us onward still;
Still let Thy mercy, as of old, be near us,
And lead us safely to Thy holy hill.
In vain to labor, unless Thou be with him,
Man goeth forth through all the weary day;
In vain his strife, in vain his toil unceasing,
Unless Thy staff bring comfort on his way.
Thou, Who hast made the north and south, watch o’er us;
Thou, in Whose Name the lonely ones rejoice,
Still let Thy cloudy pillar glide before us,
Still let us listen for Thy warning voice.
So, when the morn of endless light is waking,
And shades of evil from its splendors flee,
Safe may we rise, the earth’s dark breast forsaking,
Through all the long bright day to dwell with Thee.

Now with creation’s morning song
Let us, as children of the day,
With wakened heart and purpose strong,
The works of darkness cast away.
O may the morn so pure, so clear,
Its own sweet calm in us instill!
A guileless mind, a heart sincere,
Simplicity of word and will.
And ever, as the day glides by,
May we the busy senses rein;
Keep guard upon the hand and eye,
Nor let the conscience suffer stain.
Grant us, O God, in love to Thee,
Clear eyes to measure things below;
Faith, the invisible to see;
And wisdom, Thee in all to know.

Now with joyful exultation
Let us sing Jehovah’s praise,
To the Rock of our salvation
Loud hosannas let us raise;
Thankful tribute gladly bringing,
Let us come before Him now,
And with psalms His praises singing,
Joyful in His presence bow.
For how great a God, and glorious,
Is Jehovah Whom we sing;
Over idol gods victorious,
Great is He, our God and King.
In His hand are earth’s deep places,
His the strength of all the hills,
His the sea whose bounds He traces,
His the land His bounty fills.
To the Lord, such might revealing,
Let us come with reverence meet,
And, before our Maker kneeling,
Let us worship at His feet.
He is our own God and leads us,
We the people of His care;
With a shepherd’s hand He feeds us
As His flock in pastures fair.
While He proffers peace and pardon
Let us hear His voice today,
Lest, if we our hearts should harden,
We should perish in the way;
Lest to us, so unbelieving,
He in judgment shall declare:
Ye, so long My Spirit grieving,
Never in My rest can share.

Now woods and wolds are sleeping,
And darkness fast is creeping
O’er byre, hearth, and hall;
But thou, my soul, ere slumber,
For blessings passing number
Exalt the Giver of them all.
Ye also, O my dearest,
My friends and kindred nearest,
God rest you safe from harm!
His angel hosts attend ye,
Their golden shields defend ye,
From nightly danger and alarm.

Not worthy, Lord, to gather up the crumbs
With trembling hand that from Thy table fall,
A weary, heavy laden sinner comes
To plead Thy promise and obey Thy call.
I am not worthy to be thought Thy child,
Nor sit the last and lowest at Thy board;
Too long a wanderer and too oft beguiled;
I only ask one reconciling word.
One word from Thee, my Lord, one smile, one look,
And I could face the cold, rough world again;
And with that treasure in my heart could brook
The wrath of devils and the scorn of men.
And is not mercy Thy prerogative,
Free mercy, boundless, fathomless, divine?
Me, Lord, the chief of sinners, me forgive,
And Thine the greater glory, only Thine.
I hear Thy voice; Thou bidd’st me come and rest;
I come, I kneel, I clasp Thy pierced feet;
Thou bidd’st me take my place, a welcome guest
Among Thy saints, and of Thy banquet eat.
My praise can only breathe itself in prayer,
My prayer can only lose itself in Thee;
Dwell Thou forever in my heart, and there,
Lord, let me sup with Thee; sup Thou with me.

Lay down your head, go off to sleep
Dream of our love and future so sweet
Dream of the days that are waiting out there
Of all of the joy our family will share 
Now you're here and you're more than we had dreamed of
Now you're here and you know we think the world of you
I thank my God who has answered our prayers and delivered you safe in His care
Cause now you're here 
Close little eyes, rest your sweet head
Mom & Dad will pray for you and put you to bed
We'll be your friends as we're watchin' you grow (while watching you grow)
And help you learn the things you should know (things you should know) 
It seemed like such a long, long time (well it seemed so long)
Until the promised bonding time (such a long time)
Couldn't know how special you would be (how special now we see)
Now your with us at this place
We see your smiling face
The newest member of our family 
Lay down your head, go off to sleep
Dream of our love and future so sweet
Dream of a joy overflowing to live
That only our creator can give 
You're here 

Now, in a song of grateful praise,
To my dear Lord my voice I’ll raise;
With all His saints I’ll join to tell—
My Jesus has done all things well.
Dear Jesus is the One I love,
Oh, bless His Name! He died for me;
His blood now cleanses me from sin,
Dear Jesus now He sets me free.
All worlds His glorious power confess,
His wisdom all His works express;
But oh! His love what tongue can tell?
My Jesus has done all things well.
How sovereign, powerful and free
Has been His love to sinful me!
He plucked me from the jaws of hell—
My Jesus has done all things well.

Now, when the dusky shades of night, retreating
Before the sun’s red banner, swiftly flee;
Now, when the terrors of the dark are fleeting,
O Lord, we lift our thankful hearts to Thee.
To Thee, Whose Word, the fount of light unsealing,
When hill and dale in thickest darkness lay,
Awoke bright rays across the dim earth stealing,
And bade the even and morn complete the day.
Look from the tower of heaven, and send to cheer us,
Thy light and truth, to guide us onward still;
Still let Thy mercy, as of old, be near us,
And lead us safely to Thy holy hill.
In vain to labor, unless Thou be with him,
Man goeth forth through all the weary day;
In vain his strife, in vain his toil unceasing,
Unless Thy staff bring comfort on his way.
Thou, Who hast made the north and south, watch o’er us;
Thou, in Whose Name the lonely ones rejoice,
Still let Thy cloudy pillar glide before us,
Still let us listen for Thy warning voice.
So, when the morn of endless light is waking,
And shades of evil from its splendors flee,
Safe may we rise, the earth’s dark breast forsaking,
Through all the long bright day to dwell with Thee.

When we gather at last over Jordan,
And the ransomed in glory we see,
As the numberless sands of the seashore—
What a wonderful sight that will be!
Numberless as the sands of the seashore!
Numberless as the sands of the shore!
Oh, what a sight ’twill be,
When the ransomed host we see,
As numberless as the sands of the seashore!
When we see all the saved of the ages,
Who from sorrow and trials are free,
Meeting there with a heavenly greeting—
What a wonderful sight that will be!
When we stand by the beautiful river,
’Neath the shade of the life giving tree,
Gazing over the fair land of promise—
What a wonderful sight that will be!
When at last we behold our Redeemer,
And His glory transcendent we see,
While as King of all kingdoms He reigneth—
What a wonderful sight that will be!

I’ll see the new Jerusalem when Christ to earth does come.
I’ll see Him then, will hear His voice, all Christians will rejoice.
Of sun and moon there is no sign, God’s light o’er all will shine.
And then, when He has come with might, it never will be night.
A stream of water, crystal clear, from His throne will appear.
An end to struggle and all strife, that water brings new life.
The tree of life brings forth its fruits, on ever growing shoots.
With praise and music in the air, no thirst or hunger there.
And all who served Him, with Him reign, now free from sin and stain.
How fathomless, dear Lord, the love, come to us from above.
That caught in bondage, fraught with strife, You bring eternal life!
One day, on Your eternal shore, we’ll praise You evermore.

The newborn King Who comes today
Brings tidings of great joy,
Which sin can never take away,
Nor death nor hell destroy.
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,
And hail this glorious dawn,
For God comes down, frail man to crown:
The Lord of Life is born!
He comes not as a king of earth,
In pomp and pride to reign;
He seeks a poor and humble birth,
But free from sinful stain;
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,
Glad hymns of triumph sing:
The Wonderful, the Counsellor,
He comes, your God and King!
For us He leaves His Father’s throne,
His sapphire throne on high,
And comes to dwell on earth alone,
For fallen man to die.
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,
All hail Messiah’s dawn:
Our God comes down, earth’s joy and crown,
The King of Love is born!
Glad Gentiles in their eastern home
His radiant star behold;
To God, their King, they joy to bring
Sweet incense, myrrh, and gold.
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,
In heaven your praises sing:
Before Him fall, the Lord of all,
Your Maker and your King!
We join your song, celestial throng,
Whose anthems never cease;
We tune our lyres, with angels choirs,
To hail the Prince of Peace!
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice
All hail Immanuel’s morn:
For God comes down, frail man to crown,
To us a Child is born.

There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold.
But one was out on the hills away,
Far off from the gates of gold.
Away on the mountains wild and bare.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.
“Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
Are they not enough for Thee?"
But the Shepherd made answer: “This of Mine
Has wandered away from Me;
And although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep."
But none of the ransomed ever knew
How deep were the waters crossed;
Nor how dark was the night the Lord passed through
Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
Out in the desert He heard its cry,
Sick and helpless and ready to die;
Sick and helpless and ready to die.
“Lord, whence are those blood drops all the way
That mark out the mountain’s track?"
“They were shed for one who had gone astray
Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
“Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"
“They are pierced tonight by many a thorn;
They are pierced tonight by many a thorn."
And all through the mountains, thunder riven
And up from the rocky steep,
There arose a glad cry to the gate of Heaven,
“Rejoice! I have found My sheep!"
And the angels echoed around the throne,
“Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!
Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!"

O all ye peoples, bless our God,
Aloud proclaim His praise,
Who safely holds our souls in life,
And steadfast makes our ways.
Thou, Lord, hast proved and tested us
As silver tried by fire;
Thy hand has made our burden great
And thwarted our desire.
Through pain and trouble Thou hast led,
And humbled all our pride;
But, in the end, to liberty
And wealth Thy hand did guide.
Here in Thy house I give to Thee
The life that Thou dost bless,
And pay the solemn vows I made
When I was in distress.
Come, ye that fear the Lord, and hear
What He has done for me;
My cry for help is turned to praise,
For He has set me free.
If in my heart I sin regard,
My prayer He will not hear;
But truly God has heard my voice,
My prayer has reached His ear.
O let the Lord, our gracious God,
Forever blessed be,
Who has not turned my prayer from Him,
Nor yet His grace from me.
O all ye peoples, bless our God,
Aloud proclaim His praise,
Who safely holds our souls in life,
And steadfast makes our ways.

Sinner, how thy heart is troubled,
God is coming very near;
Do not hide thy deep emotion,
Do not check that falling tear.

O Beautiful hills of Galilee!
Amid whose scenes the Saviour dwells,
Your flow'rs that bloom so beautifully,
Of heaven's lasting beauties tell.
We're travelling home; one by one,
Across death's river our friends are gone,
And we are following, one by one.
"Then, O poor soul, if you would be
Thus clothed in robes as pure as they,
Lay all else down, come follow me;
My love shall last through endless day."
My soul replies, "'T is not for me,"
With tears fast streaming from mine eyes;
That voice still calls, "Come, follow me,
We're going home beyond the skies.
"I come you maladies to heal,
I left my Father's home on high;
His wondrous love I thus reveal
And thus are trembling souls brought nigh.
"I go away--I'll come again,
My Holy Spirit hov'ring round,
To show that for you I was slain,
And guard you till the trump shall sound.

O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain;
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood,
From sea to shining sea.

O Bethlem town tonight is cold,
And Bethlem town is very dark;
Down tumbling street, on upland wold
Stirs neither wife nor patriarch;
No travelers the inn doors seek
Where still the gust stirred signboards creak.

O bless the Lord, my soul!
Let all within me join,
And aid my tongue to bless His Name
Whose favors are divine.

O bless the Lord, my soul!
His grace to thee proclaim!
And all that is within me join
To bless His holy Name!

O blessed be the Lord
For His eternal Word,
That sheds around the paths we tread
Its calm and steady rays:
Come, worship at His throne;
O make His wonders known,
And let His temple gates be filled
With songs of praise.

O blessed, blessed Bible,
Our treasured book divine,
With hope, and joy, and comfort,
Thy pages brightly shine.

O blest Creator of the light,
Who mak’st the day with radiance bright,
And o’er the forming world didst call
The light from chaos first of all.

O blessed day of motherhood!
We lift our hearts in praise,
To thank the Source of every good:
Thy joy crowns all our days.
O God, our Father, bless this day,
Enrich its golden store
Of blessed mother love, and may
Thy children Thee adore.

O blessed day when 
first was poured
The blood of our redeeming Lord!
O blessed day when Christ began
His saving work for sinful man!

Divine, eternal Unity,
God Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Be Thou this day my Guide and Host.

O blessed home where man and wife
Together lead a godly life
By deeds their faith confessing!
There many a happy day is spent,
There Jesus gladly will consent
To tarry with His blessing.

O blessed Jesus! This
Thy lowly manger is
The paradise where oft my soul would feed:
Here is the place, my Lord,
Where lies th’eternal Word
Clothed with our flesh, made like to us indeed.

O blessed Lord, what hast Thou done!
How vast a ransom paid!
Who could conceive God’s only Son
Upon the altar laid!

O blessed Son of God,
In love and faith we plead,
That Thou wouldst bind our minds and hearts
In Brotherhood of need.

O blessed souls are they
Whose sins are covered o’er;
Divinely blessed, to whom the Lord
Imputes their guilt no more.

Eternal life is in God’s Word
For dead and dying men;
By it alone we know the Lord,
Unseen by mortal ken.

Oh, bliss of the purified, bliss 
of the free,
I plunge in the crimson tide 
opened for me;
O’er sin and uncleanness exulting 
I stand,
And point to the print of the 
nails in His hand.

O boundless salvation! deep ocean of love,
O fullness of mercy, Christ brought from above,
The whole world redeeming, so rich and so free,
Now flowing for all men, now flowing for all men,
Now flowing for all men, come, roll over me!

O boundless Wisdom, God most high,
O Maker of the earth and sky,
Who bid’st the parted waters flow
In heaven above, on earth below.

O Breath of Life, come 
sweeping through us,
Revive Thy church with life and pow'r;
O Breath of Life, come, cleanse, renew us,
And fit Thy church to meet this hour.

O Bread of life from Heaven,
O Food to pilgrims given,
O Manna from above:
Feed with the blessed sweetness
Of Your divine completeness
The souls that want and need Your love.

O Bread to pilgrims given,
O food that angels eat,
O manna sent from heaven,
For heav'n-born natures meet:
Give us, for thee long pining,
To eat till richly filled;
Till, earth's delights resigning,
Our every wish is stilled.
O water, life-bestowing,
Forth from the Saviour's heart
A fountain purely flowing,
A fount of love thou art:
O let us, freely tasting,
Our burning thirst assuage;
Thy sweetness, never wasting,
Avails from age to age.
Jesus, this feast receiving,
We thee unseen adore;
Thy faithful word believing,
We take, and doubt no more:
Give us, thou true and loving,
On earth to live in thee;
Then, death the veil removing,
Thy glorious face to see.

O breath of God, breathe on us now,
And move within us while we pray:
The Spring of our new life art Thou,
The very light of our new day.

O Breath of life, come sweeping through us,
Revive Thy church with life and power;
O Breath of life, come, cleanse, renew us,
And fit Thy church to meet this hour.

O Bride of Christ, rejoice!
Exultant raise thy voice
To hail the day of glory,
Foretold in sacred story.

O Brightness of th’immortal Father’s face,
Most holy, heav’nly, blest,
Lord Jesus Christ, in Whom His truth and grace
Are visibly expressed!

O Brightness of th’immortal Father’s face,
Most holy, heav’nly, blest,
Lord Jesus Christ, in Whom His truth and grace
Are visibly expressed!

O brother, life’s journey beginning,
With courage and firmness arise!
Look well to the course thou art choosing;
Be earnest, be watchful, and wise!
Remember—two paths are before thee,
And both thy attention invite;
But one leadeth on to destruction,
The other to joy and delight.

O brother man, fold to thy heart thy brother;
Where pity dwells, the peace of God is there;
To worship rightly is to love each other,
Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.

O brothers, lift your voice, triumphant songs to raise;
Till Heav’n on high rejoices, and earth is filled with 
praise;
Ten thousand hearts are bounding, with holy hopes and 
free;
The Gospel trump is sounding, the trump of jubilee.

Well ol' Buddah was a man
And I'm sure that he meant well
But I pray for his disciples
Less they wind up in Hell
And I'm sure that ol' Muhammad
Thought he knew the way
But it won't be Hare Krishna
We stand before on the Judgment Day

True patriot love in all thy sons command.
With glowing hearts we see thee rise, 
The true north strong and free! 
From far and wide, 
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
God keep our land glorious and free! 
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

great prairies spread and lordly rivers flow,
how dear to us thy broad domain,
from east to western sea,
thou land of hope for all who toil!
Thou true north, strong and free!
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

our own beloved native land,
our true north strong and free!
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
Ruler supreme, who hearest humble prayer,
hold our dominion in thy loving case.
Help us to find, O God, in thee
a lasting rich reward,
as waiting for the better day,
we ever stand on guard.
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

O Captain of God’s host, whose dreadful might
Led forth to war the armed seraphim,
And from the starry height,
Subdued in burning light,
Cast down that ancient dragon dark and grim;

O changeless Christ, for ever new,
who walked our earthly ways,
still draw our hearts as once you drew
the hearts of other days.
As once you spoke by plain and hill
or taught by shore and sea,
so be today our teacher still,
O Christ of Galilee.
As wind and storm their master heard
and his command fulfilled,
may troubled hearts receive your word,
the tempest-tossed be stilled.
And as of old who prayed
your healing hand was shown,
so be your touch upon us laid,
unseen but not unknown.
In broken bread, in wine outpoured,
your new and living way
proclaim to us, O risen Lord,
O Christ of this our day.
O changeless Christ, till life is past
your blessing still be given;
then bring us home, to taste at last
the timeless joys of heaven.

O changeless Word of life and light,
A perfect rule to guide me,
I take thy counsels, trust thy truth,
And in my heart I hide thee.

O chief of cities, Bethlehem,
Of David’s crown the fairest gem,
But more to us than David’s name,
In you, as man, the Savior came.

O child of God, wait patiently when dark thy path may 
be,
And let thy faith lean trustingly on Him Who cares for 
Thee;
And though the clouds hang drearily upon the brow of 
night,
Yet in the morning joy will come, and fill thy soul with 
light.

O Child of lowly manger birth
On whose low cry the ages wait,
Lead us Thy way, and every day
Guide us to see what made Thee great.

O Christ, our God, Who with Thine own hast been,
Our spirits cleave to Thee, the Friend unseen.

O Christ, our Hope, our heart’s Desire,
Redemption’s only Spring!
Creator of the world art Thou,
Its Savior and its King.

O Christ, our Joy, gone up on high
To fill Thy throne above the sky,
How glorious dost Thou shine!
Thy sovereign rule the worlds obey,
And earthly joys all fade away
In that pure light of Thine.

O Christ, our joy, to Whom is giv’n
A throne o’er all the thrones of Heav’n,
In Thee, Whose hand all things obey,
The world’s vain pleasures pass away.

O Christ, our King, Creator, Lord,
Savior of all who trust Thy Word,
To them who seek Thee ever near,
Now to our praises bend Thine ear.

O Christ, our true and only Light,
Illumine those who sit in night;
Let those afar now hear Thy voice,
And in Thy fold with us rejoice.

O Christ, Redeemer of our race,
Thou Brightness of the Father’s face,
Of Him, and with Him ever One,
Ere times and seasons had begun.

O Christ, the healer, we have come
to pray for health, to plead for friends.
How can we fail to be restored,
when reached by love that never ends?
From every ailment flesh endures
our bodies clamor to be freed;
yet in our hearts we would confess
that wholeness is our deepest need.
How strong, O Lord, are our desires,
how weak our knowledge of ourselves!
Release in us those healing truths
unconscious pride resists or shelves.
In conflicts that destroy our health,
we diagnose the world's disease;
our common life declares our ills:
is there no cure, O Christ, for these?
Grant that we all, made one in faith,
in your community may find
the wholeness that, enriching us,
shall reach the whole of humankind.

O Christ, the heavens’ eternal King,
Creator, unto Thee we sing,
With God the Father ever One,
Co-equal, co-eternal Son.

O Christ, the Lord of Heaven, to Thee
Clothed with all majesty divine,
Eternal power and glory be:
Eternal praise and right is Thine.

O Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life,
Show me the living way,
That in the tumult and the strife,
I may not go astray.

O Christ, the Word Incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth, unchanged, unchanging,
O Light of our dark sky;
we praise thee for the radiance
that from the scripture's page,
a lantern to our footsteps,
shines on from age to age.
The Church from our dear Master
received the word divine,
and still that light is lifted
o'er all the earth to shine.
It is the chart and compass
that o'er life's surging sea,
mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
still guides, O Christ, to thee.
O make thy Church, dear Savior,
a lamp of purest gold,
to bear before the nations
thy true light as of old;
O teach thy wandering pilgrims
by this their path to trace,
till, clouds and darkness ended,
they see face to face.

O Christ, Thou hast ascended,
Triumphantly on high!
By cherub guards attended
And armies of the sky:
Let earth tell forth the story—
Our very flesh and bone,
Immanuel, in glory,
Ascends His Father’s throne.

O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stead,
Didst bear all ill for me.
A Victim led, Thy blood was shed;
Now there’s no load for me.

O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stead,
Didst bear all ill for me.
A Victim led, Thy blood was shed;
Now there’s no load for me.

O Christ, Who art the Light and Day,
Thou drivest darksome night away!
We know Thee as the Light of light
Illuminating mortal sight.

O Christ, Who hast prepared a place
For us around Thy throne of grace,
We pray Thee, lift our hearts above,
And draw them with the cords of love.

O Christ, who holds the open gate,
O Christ who drives the furrow straight,
O Christ, the plow, O Christ, the laughter
of holy white birds flying after.
Lo, all my heart's field red and torn,
and thou wilt bring the young green corn,
the young green corn divinely springing,
the young green corn for ever singing.
And when the field is fresh and fair
thy blessed feet shall glitter there,
and we will walk the weeded field,
and tell the golden harvest's yield.
The corn that makes the holy bread
by which the soul of man is fed,
the holy bread, the food unpriced,
thy everlasting mercy, O Christ.

O Christ, thou Lord of worlds, thine ear to hear us 
bow
On this the festival of thine apostle now,
Who taught to men thy power to free from sin's 
offence
The souls of those that tread the way of penitence.
Redeemer, save thy work, thy noble work of grace,
Sealed with the holy light that beameth from thy 
face;
Nor suffer them to fall to Satan's wiles a prey
For whom thou didst on earth death's costly ransom 
pay.
Pity thy flock, enthralled by sin's captivity,
Forgive each guilty soul and set the bondmen free;
And those thou hast redeemed by thine own Passion 
sore
Grant to rejoice with thee, O King, for evermore.

O Christ, whom we may love and know
And follow to the end,
We who are friends together come
To thee our heavenly Friend.
Thou who didst share our daily toil
To make us good and free,
Help us to share thy fiery love
And shining purity.
Give us thy love, that loves us all
And dared the glorious Cross,
That we may love to share and know
Each other's joy and loss.
Give us thy purity to shield
Our souls in each dark place,
To give us wings to rise to thee,
And power to see thy face.

O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,
To tell to all the world that God is light,
That He who made all nations is not willing
One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

O Christians, leagued together to battle for the 
right
Arise and don your armor, put the foe to flight!
We’ve given our allegiance to serve without 
surcease
The mighty Lord of armies and gentle Prince of 
Peace.

O Christmas night! Day’s light transcending,
Who no beginning had or end
Till He a man became, was God.
Then He Who ne’er before was human
Was born in Bethlehem of woman,
When nips the frost the verdant sod.

O Church of God, arise!
Reach out thy helping hand,
And like a trumpet let thy voice
Go forth to ev’ry land;
Lay not thine armor down,
Nor cease by day or night,
To lift the sword of Gospel truth,
And wield it for the right.

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels;

O come all ye saints, in glorious dress,
Arrayed in His love, and His righteousness.
Come sing in His presence, come speak of His 
grace
He’s standing among us, behold His dear face.

O come and dwell in me,
Spirit of power within,
And bring the glorious liberty
From sorrow, fear, and sin.

O come, and let us to the Lord
In songs our voices raise,
With joyful noise let us the Rock
Of our salvation praise.
Let us before his presence come
With praise and thankful voice;
Let us sing psalms to him with grace,
And make a joyful noise.
The Lord's a great God, and great King
Above all gods he is;
Depths of the earth are in his hand,
The strength of hills is his.
To him the spacious sea belongs,
For he the same did make;
The dry land also from his hands
Its form at first did take.
O come and let us worship him,
Let us bow down withal,
And on our knees before the Lord
Our Maker let us fall.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, and is,
And shall be evermore.

O come and mourn with me awhile;
And tarry here the cross beside;
O come, together let us mourn;
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.

O come and mourn with me awhile;
O come ye to the Saviour's side;
O come, together let us mourn:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
Have we no tears to shed for him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews deride?
Ah, look how patiently he hangs:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
How fast his hands and feet are nailed;
His throat with parching thirst is dried;
His failing eyes are dimmed with blood:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
Seven times, he spake, seven words of love;
And all three hours his silence cried
For mercy on the souls of men:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
O love of God! O sin of man!
In this dread act your strength is tried;
And victory remains with love:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.

O come and sing to the God, the Lord,
To Him our voices raise;
Let us in our most joyful songs
The Lord, our Savior, praise.

O come before the Lord, our King,
And in His presence let us sing;
Let us in glad and joyful lays
The Rock of our salvation praise;
Before Him come with thankful song,
In joyful psalms His praise prolong.

O come, let us sing to the Lord,
To Him our voices raise;
With joyful noise let us the Rock
Of our salvation praise.

O come, loud anthems let us sing,
Loud thanks to our almighty King;
For we our voices high should raise,
When our salvation’s Rock we praise.

O come, My people, to my Law,
Attentively give ear;
With willing heart and teachable
The words of wisdom hear.

O come, my soul, bless thou the Lord thy Maker,
And all within me bless His holy Name;
Bless thou the Lord, forget not all His mercies,
His pard’ning grace and saving love proclaim.

O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.

O come, Redeemer of mankind, appear,
Thee with full hearts the virgin born we greet;
Let every age with rapt amazement hear
That wondrous birth which for our God is meet.

Oh! come to the merciful 
Savior Who calls you,
Oh! come to the Lord Who 
forgives and forgets;
Though dark be the fortune on 
earth that befalls you,
There’s a bright home above, 
where the sun never sets.

O come, and let us to the Lord
In songs our voices raise,
With joyful noise let us the Rock
Of our salvation praise.
Let us before his presence come
With praise and thankful voice;
Let us sing psalms to him with grace,
And make a joyful noise.
The Lord's a great God, and great King
Above all gods he is;
Depths of the earth are in his hand,
The strength of hills is his.
To him the spacious sea belongs,
For he the same did make;
The dry land also from his hands
Its form at first did take.
O come and let us worship him,
Let us bow down withal,
And on our knees before the Lord
Our Maker let us fall.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, and is,
And shall be evermore.

O come and mourn with me awhile;
O come ye to the Saviour's side;
O come, together let us mourn:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
Have we no tears to shed for him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews deride?
Ah, look how patiently he hangs:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
How fast his hands and feet are nailed;
His throat with parching thirst is dried;
His failing eyes are dimmed with blood:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
Seven times, he spake, seven words of love;
And all three hours his silence cried
For mercy on the souls of men:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
O love of God! O sin of man!
In this dread act your strength is tried;
And victory remains with love:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.

O come, divine Messiah!
The world in silence waits the day
When hope shall sing its triumph,
And sadness flee away.

O Comforter, gentle and tender,
O holy and heavenly Dove;
We’re yielding our hearts in surrender,
We’re waiting Thy fullness to prove.

O Could I find, from day to day, 
A nearness to my God;
Then should my hours glide sweet away,
And live upon thy word.
Lord, I desire with thee to live
Anew, from day to day,
In joys the world can never give,
Nor ever take away.
O Jesus, come and rule my heart,
And make me wholly thine;
And never, never more depart,
But be forever mine.
Thus, till my last expiring breath,
Thy goodness I'd adore;
And when my flesh dissolves in death,
My soul shall love thee more.
Through boundless grace I then shall spend
An everlasting day,
In the embraces of my Friend,
Who took my guilt away.
That worthy name shall have the praise,
To whom all praise is due;
While every ransomed soul shall gaze
On scenes forever new.

Could I find some peaceful bow'r
Where sin hath neither place nor pow'r;
This traitor vile, I fain would shun;
But can not from His presence run.
When to the throne of grace I flee,
He stands between God and me;
Where'er I rove, where'er I rest,
I feel Him working in my breast.
Lord, free me from this deadly foe,
Which keeps my faith and hope so low;
I long to dwell in heav'n my homem
Where not one sinful though can come.

O could I speak the matchless worth,
O could I sound the glories forth which in my Savior shine!
I’d sing His glorious righteousness, and magnify the wondrous 
grace
Which made salvation mine, which made salvation mine.

O courage, my soul, and let us journey on,
For tho’ the night is dark, it won’t be very long.
O thanks be to God, the morning light appears,
And the storm is passing over, Hallelujah!

O, Creator of the cosmos, we present our hearts in prayer.
We are awestruck by your glory, which surrounds us everywhere.
From the birdsong of the morning to a stormy sky at night,
You reveal yourself in Nature, in its gentleness and might.

Far back in the ages past,
Veiled in the mist of years,
A wondrous vision I behold,
That moves my heart to tears;
There hanging upon a cross,
The form of One I see,
Who suffered there a sinner's death,
That sinners might be free;
Who suffered there a sinner's death,
That sinners might be free.

O darkest woe! Ye tears, forth flow!
Has earth so sad a wonder?
God the Father’s only Son
Now lies buried yonder.

O Day of God, draw nigh
In beauty and in power;
Come with thy timeless judgment now
To match our present hour.

O day of light and gladness,
Of prophecy and song,
What thoughts within us waken,
What hallowed memories throng!
The soul’s horizon widens,
Past, present, future blend;
And rises on our vision
The life that hath no end.

O day of peace that dimly shines
through all our hopes and prayers and dreams,
guide us to justice, truth, and love,
delivered from our selfish schemes.
May the swords of hate fall from our hands,
our hearts from envy find release,
till by God's grace our warring world
shall see Christ's promised reign of peace.
Then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb,
nor shall the fierce devour the small;
as beasts and cattle calmly graze,
a little child shall lead them all.
Then enemies shall learn to love,
all creatures find their true accord;
the hope of peace shall be fulfilled,
for all the earth shall know the Lord.

O day of rest and gladness, of day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness, most beautiful, most bright:
On Thee, the high and lowly, through ages joined in tune,
Sing holy, holy, holy, to the great God Triune.

O dearest Jesus, what law hast Thou broken
That such sharp sentence should on Thee be spoken?
Of what great crime hast Thou to make confession—
What dark transgression?

O do not let the Word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved, O tonight.

O do some good deed ev’ry day,
And speak kind words along the way;
O sing a glad and cheerful song,
For it may make some weak heart strong.

There’s a land unseen by our mortal eyes,
And its joys no tongue can tell;
Where in robes of white, in its vales of light,
We shall meet, and forever dwell.

Oh, enter, Lord, Thy 
temple,
Be Thou my spirit’s Guest,
Who gavest me, the 
earth-born,
A second birth more blest.
Thou in the Godhead, Lord,
Though here to dwell Thou 
deignest,
Forever equal reignest,
Art equally adored.

O faith of England, taught of old
by faithful shepherds of the fold,
the hallowing of our nation;
thou wast many a wealthy year,
through many a darkened day of fear
the rock of our salvation.
Arise, arise, good Christian men,
your glorious standard raise again,
the cross of Christ who calls you;
who bids you live and bids you die
for his great cause and stands on high
to witness what befalls you.
Our fathers heard the trumpet call
through lowly cot and kingly hall
from oversea resounding;
they bowed their stubborn wills to learn
the truths that live, the thoughts that burn,
with new resolve abounding.
Arise, arise, good Christian men,
your glorious standard raise again,
the cross of Christ who guides you;
whose arm is bared to join the fray,
who marshals you in stern array,
fearless, whate'er betides you.
Our fathers held the faith received, 
by saints declared, by saints believed,
by saints in death defended;
through pain of doubt and bitterness,
through pain of treason and distress,
they for the right contended.
Arise, arise, good Christian men,
your glorious standard raise again,
the cross of Christ who bought you;
who leads you forth in this new age
with long-enduring hearts to wage
the warfare he has taught you.
Though frequent be the loud alarms,
though still we march by ambushed arms
of death and hell surrounded,
with Christ for Chief we have no foe,
nor force nor craft can overthrow
the Church that he has founded.
Arise, arise, good Christian men,
your glorious standard raise again,
the cross wherewith he signed you;
the King himself shall lead you on,
shall watch you till the strife be done,
then near his throne shall find you.

O faithful God, thanks be to Thee
Who dost forgive iniquity.
Thou grantest help in sin’s distress,
And soul and body dost Thou bless.

O Father, hear my morning prayer,
Thine aid impart to me,
That I may make my life today
Acceptable to Thee.

O Father, hear my morning prayer,
Thine aid impart to me,
That I may make my life today
Acceptable to Thee.

O Father, on our festal day,
behold us with thy blessing,
as year by year thy children come
thy love and truth confessing;
we stand rejoicing in thy house
with thankful hearts and lowly,
and dare to raise our songs of praise
to thee, O Lord most holy.
For love by which through all our days
our lives have been surrounded,
for all the goodness of thy hand
which hath to us abounded,
for home and health and happiness,
for all the joy of living,
to thee we sing, our Lord and King,
and offer our thanksgiving.
But chiefly for the boundless love
that brought to us salvation,
we bow before thy mighty throne
in humble adoration;
and to thine honor, God most high,
we hymn the wondrous story
of him who came on earth to die,
and rose, and reigns in glory.

O Father, Thy kingdom is come upon earth,
Thou rulest in all Thy creation;
Thou sendest Thy witnesses, telling Thy worth,
To call and entreat every nation,
With news of Thy mighty salvation,
With news of Thy mighty salvation.

O Father, all creating,
Whose wisdom, love, and power
First bound two lives together
In Eden’s primal hour,
Today to these Thy children
Thine earliest gifts renew,
A home by Thee made happy,
A love by Thee kept true.

O Father, bless the children
Brought hither to Thy gate;
Lift up their fallen nature,
Restore their lost estate;
Renew Thine image in them,
And own them, by this sign,
The very sons and daughters
New born of birth divine.

Our Father, by Whose servants
Our house was built of old,
Whose hand hath crowned her children
With blessing manifold,
For Thine unfailing mercies
Far-strewn along our way,
With all who passed before us, 
We praise Thy Name today.

O Father, by whose sovereign sway
The sun and stars in order move,
Yet who hast made us bold to say
Thy nature and thy name is love:
O royal Son, whose every deed
Showed love and love's divinity,
Yet didst not scorn the humblest need
At Cana's feast in Galilee.
O Holy Spirit, who dost speak
In saint and sage since time began,
Yet givest courage to the weak
And teachest love to selfish man:
Be present in our hearts to-day,
All powerful to bless, and give
To these thy children grace that they
May love, and through their loving live.

O Father, for this little life
Entrusted from above,
Ere yet he face earth's sin and strife,
We supplicate thy love.
As Hannah to the Temple gate
Her dearest treasure bore,
So, Lord, to thee we consecrate
This child for evermore.
Thy faithful soldier, may he fight
With falsehood, sin, and shame,
And loosing all to win the right
Confess thy holy name.
Thy faithful servant, may he learn
To love and labour still,
And with a flaming spirit burn
To know and do thy will.
O Saviour, all he is is thine,
And all he yet may be:
O shelter him with love divine,
And draw him near to thee.
For thou, O Lord, art all our life,
In thee all struggles end:
Through all the sorrow and the strife
Our Maker and our Friend.

O Father, hear me as I pray to Thee,
I know that I am far from purity;
But Jesus died that sinful men might live,
So in His Name I ask Thee to forgive.

O Father, in Whose great design
Our human love is made divine,
Teach us to give our love to those
By sin beset and all its woes;
On Thee for them to cast our care,
By fasting and by lowly prayer.

O Father, Thou Who hast created all
In wisest love, we pray,
Look on this babe, who at Thy gracious call
Is entering on life’s way;
Bend o’er 

O Father, we thank thee for Jesus thy Son,
For all that for us by his death he hath won,
His rising at Easter, his reign on thy throne,
His gift of the Spirit to make us thine own.
All praise to thee, Lord, for evangelists brave,
The witness by word and by life that they gave,
The Church of our fathers, the home of us all,
Her sturdy grey towers and steeples so tall.
All praise for the masons who built them so true
With axe and with chisel, the best that they knew;
All praise for the craftsmen who carved with a will,
The nave and the chancel with glory to fill.
How surely they painted, those guildsmen of old,
The screen with its martyrs aglimmer with gold!
How fair shone their windows which let the sun 
through,
And flecked the white pillars with crimson and blue!
Then ring out, ye belfries, from hill and from plain,
And thunder, ye organs, in deep-toned :
Praise God, priest and people, for blessings 
outpoured
On Britain, our homeland.Yes, praise ye the Lord!

O Father, we would thank Thee
For all Thy love has given,
Our present joy of sonship,
Our future joy in Heaven;
The life which sin had blighted
So wondrously restored
By our mysterious union
With Jesus Christ our Lord.

O Father, Who didst all things make
That Heav’n and earth might do Thy will,
Bless us this night for Jesus’ sake
And for Thy work preserve us still.

O Father, You are sovereign
In all the worlds You made;
Your mighty Word was spoken,
And light and life obeyed.
Your voice commands the seasons
And bounds the ocean’s shore,
Sets stars within their courses
And stills the tempests’ roar.

Eternity is drawing near,
O unconverted soul.
Dost thou not fear the troubled waves
That o’er thee soon may roll?

O Food of men wayfaring,
The bread of angels sharing,
O Manna from on high!
We hunger; Lord, supply us,
Nor Thy delights deny us,
Whose hearts to Thee draw nigh.

O Food that weary pilgrims love,
O Bread of angel hosts above,
O Manna of the saints,
The hungry soul would feed on Thee;
Ne’er may the heart unsolaced be
Which for Thy sweetness faints.

O food to pilgrims given,
O bread of life from Heaven,
O manna from on high!
We hunger, Lord, supply us,
Nor Thy delights deny us,
Whose hearts to Thee draw nigh.

O for a closer walk with God,
A calm and heavenly frame,
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb!

O, for a faith that will not shrink,
Though pressed by every foe,
That will not tremble on the brink
Of any earthly woe!

O for a glance of heavenly day,
To take this stubborn heart away,
And thaw, with beams of love divine,
This heart, this frozen heart of mine.

O for a heart of calm repose
Amid the world’s loud roar,
A life that like a river flows
Along a peaceful shore!

O for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that always feels Thy blood
So freely shed for me.

O for a shout of joy, loud as the 
theme we sing!
To this divine employ your hearts and 
voices bring;
Sound, sound, through all the earth 
abroad,
The love, th’eternal love of God;
The love, th’eternal love of God.

O for a shout of sacred joy
To God the sov’reign King!
Let ev’ry land their tongues employ,
And hymns of triumph sing.

O for a sweet, inspiring ray,
To animate our feeble strains,
From the bright realms of endless 
day,
The blissful realms where Jesus 
reigns.

Glory to the Lamb
Whose throne shall ever reign
God in the highest
Worthy to merit our praise

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

O for that flame of living fire,
Which shone so bright in saints 
of old!
Which bade their souls to Heav’n 
aspire,
Calm in distress, in danger 
bold.

O for that tenderness of heart
Which bows before the Lord,
Acknowledging how just Thou art,
And trembling at Thy Word!

O give thanks to Him Who made
Morning light and evening shade;
Source and Giver of all good,
Nightly sleep and daily food;
Quickener of our wearied powers,
Guard of our unconscious hours.

O give the Lord whole-hearted 
praise,
To Him thanksgiving I will 
bring;
With all His people I will raise
My voice and of His glory sing.

O gladsome light, O grace of 
our Creator’s face,
The eternal splendor wearing; 
celestial, holy blessed,
Our Savior Jesus Christ, 
joyful in Your appearing!

O glorious day when God's love overflowed
and all its beauty on the earth bestowed;
the Spirit gave all creatures life and health
and on them breathed the life of God's own self.
In all creation, in each tiny flower,
in every life we see God's living power.
More glorious still that day of storm and flame
when God on Sinai's mount to Moses came;
when Israel, from the waters brought ashore,
received its calling and God's holy law.
For on that day of God, the great I AM,
the Spirit on the chosen people came.
Most wonderful of all that holy dawn
in which the Savior of the world was born!
The Spirit rested on a Hebrew maid
and God in human form came to our aid.
Then, Holy Spirit, your great love excelled
when we our God in flesh and blood beheld.
Christ rose from death, victorious over sin;
the ascended Lord now reigns, the world to win;
and on the church that it may witness give,
God's love was poured, that through it all might live.
On this fresh Pentecost, live-giving Lord,
come, spread through us your saving love abroad.

O glorious hope of perfect 
love!
It lifts me up to things 
above;
It bears on eagles’ wings.
It gives my ravished soul a 
taste,
And makes me for some moments 
feast
With Jesus’ priests and kings,
With Jesus’ priests and kings.

O glorious King of martyr 
hosts,
Thou Crown that each confessor 
boasts,
Who leadest to celestial day
The saints who cast earth’s 
joys away;

O glorious Maid, exalted far
beyond the light of burning star,
from him who made thee thou hast won
grace to be Mother of his Son.
That which was lost in hapless Eve
thy holy Scion did retrieve;
the tear-worn sons of Adam's race
through thee have seen the heavenly place.
Thou wast the gate of heaven's high Lord,
the door through which the light hath poured.
Christians rejoice, for through a Maid
to all mankind is life conveyed!
All honor, laud and glory be,
O Jesus, Virgin-born to thee!
All glory, as is ever meet,
to Father and to Paraclete.

O God, above the drifting 
years,
The shrines our fathers 
founded stand,
And where the higher gain 
appears,
We trace the working of Thy 
hand.

O God, be merciful to me,
My soul for refuge comes to 
Thee,
Beneath Thy wings I safe will 
stay,
Until these troubles pass 
away.
To God Most High shall rise my 
prayer,
To God Who makes my wants His 
care,
From Heav’n He will salvation 
send,
And me from every foe defend.

O God, be with us, for the night is falling;
For Thy protection we to Thee are calling;
Beneath Thy shadow to our rest we yield us;
Thou, Lord, wilt shield us.

O God, before Thy sun’s bright 
beams
All night’s dark shadows fly;
So on the soul Thy mercy 
gleams,
And doubts and terrors die.

O God, beneath Thy guiding 
hand
Our exiled fathers crossed the 
sea;
And when they trod the wintry 
strand,
With prayer and psalm they 
worshipped Thee.

O God beyond all praising,
we worship you today
and sing the love amazing
that songs cannot repay;
for we can only wonder
at every gift you send,
at blessings without number
and mercies without end:
we lift our hearts before you
and wait upon your word,
we honor and adore you,
our great and mighty Lord.
Then hear, O gracious Savior,
accept the love we bring,
that we who know your favor
may serve you as our king;
and whether our tomorrows
be filled with good or ill,
we'II triumph through our sorrows
and rise to bless you still:
to marvel at your beauty
and glory in your ways,
and make a joyful duty
our sacrifice of praise.

O God, creation’s secret 
force,
Thyself unmoved, all 
motion’s source,
Who from the morn till 
evening ray
Through all its changes 
guid’st the day:

O God, forsake me not!
Thy gracious presence lend me;
Lead Thou Thy helpless child;
Thy Holy Spirit send me
That I my course may run,
Be Thou my Light, my Lot,
My Staff, my Rock, my Shield—
O God, forsake me not!

O God, forsake me not!
Thy gracious presence lend me;
Lead Thou Thy helpless child;
Thy Holy Spirit send me
That I my course may run,
Be Thou my Light, my Lot,
My Staff, my Rock, my Shield—
O God, forsake me not!

O God, give Thou ear to my 
plea,
And hide not Thyself from my 
cry;
O hearken and answer Thou 
me,
As restless and weary I 
sigh.

O God, great Father, Lord 
and King!
Our children unto Thee we 
bring;
And strong in faith, and 
hope, and love,
We dare Thy steadfast Word 
to prove.

O God, hear Thou the nation’s prayer,
We lift our cause to Thee;
We wage the holy war of Christ;
We fight to make men free.

O God, how good Thou art
To all the pure of heart,
Though life seems vain.
Burdened with anxious 
care,
I groped in dark despair,
Till in Thy house of 
prayer,
All was made plain.

O God, I cried, no dark 
disguise
Can e’er hereafter hide 
from me
Thy radiant identity, Thy 
radiant identity!
I know the path that tells 
the way
Thro’ the cool eve of 
every day.
God, I can push the grass 
apart
And lay my finger on Thy 
heart.

O God, I love Thee; not 
that my poor love
May win me entrance to Thy 
Heaven above,
Nor yet that strangers to 
Thy love must know
The bitterness of 
everlasting woe.

O God, I thank Thee for 
each sight
Of beauty that Thy hand 
doth give;
For sunny skies and air 
and light;
O God, I thank Thee that I 
live.

O God in heaven, whose loving plan 
ordained for us our parents' care, 
and from the time our life began, 
the shelter of a home to share.

O God, in whom we live and move,
Thy love is law, Thy law is love;
Thy present Spirit waits to fill
The soul which comes to do Thy will.

O God, mine inmost soul 
convert,
And deeply on my 
thoughtful heart
Eternal things impress;
Give me to feel their 
solemn weight,
And save me ere it be too 
late;
Wake me to righteousness.

O God, most holy are 
Thy ways,
And who like Thee 
deserves my praise?
Thou only doest 
wondrous things,
The whole wide world 
Thy glory sings;
Thine outstretched


O God, my God, my all Thou art!
Ere shines the dawn of rising day,
Thy sovereign light within my heart,
Thy all enlivening power display.

O God, my God, wherefore 
dost Thou
Forsake me utterly?
And helpest not when I 
do make
My great complaint and 
cry?

O God, my heavenly 
King,
My Savior, and my 
All,
To Thee my every 
power I bring,
And at Thy footstool 
fall.

O God, my strength 
and fortitude
In truth I

O God, no longer hold Thy peace,
No longer silent be;
Thine enemies lift up their head
To fight Thy saints and Thee.
Against Thine own, whom Thou dost love,
Their craft Thy foes employ;
They think to cut Thy people off,
Thy church they would destroy.

O God, of all the strength and power,
Who dost, Thyself unmoved, each hour
Through all its changes guide the day
From early morn to evening’s ray;

O God of Bethel, by Whose hand
Thy people still are fed,
Who through this weary pilgrimage
Hast all our fathers led.

O God of earth and altar, bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter, our people drift and die;
The walls of gold entomb us, the swords of scorn 
divide;
Take not Thy thunder from us, but take away our 
pride.

O God of every nation,
of every race and land,
redeem the whole creation
with your almighty hand;
where hate and fear divide us
and bitter threats are hurled,
in love and mercy guide us
and heal our strife-torn world.
From search for wealth and power
and scorn of truth and right,
from trust in bombs that shower
destruction through the night,
from pride of race and nation
and blindness to your way,
deliver every nation,
eternal God, we pray!
Lord, strengthen all who labor
that we may find release
from fear of rattling saber,
from dread of war's increase;
when hope and courage falter,
your still small voice be heard;
with faith that none can alter,
your servants undergird.
Keep bright in us the vision
of days when war shall cease,
when hatred and division 
give way to love and peace,
till dawns the morning glorious
when truth and justice reign
and Christ shall rule victorious
o'er all the world's domain.

O God of font and altar,
of music, grandeur, light;
toward whom the soaring arches
aspire beyond their height:
as beauty draws us to you
within this house of prayer,
let worship form and feed us
to help us show your care.
O life-bestowing Spirit, 
inspire this hallowed space;
breathe through us with new fervor
and fill us with your grace.
Arouse our lagging spirits,
enflame our hearts with joy;
here let a love be kindled
that death cannot destroy.
O Christ, who cleansed the temple,
baptize us with your zeal,
and teach us your compassion
to love, forgive, and heal.
Be in our midst to claim us
and mark us as your own;
then send us forth in witness
to make your mercy known.

O God of God! O Light of Light!
Thou Prince of Peace, Thou King of kings,
To Thee, where angels know no night,
The song of praise forever rings:
To Him Who sits upon the throne,
The Lamb once slain for sinful men,
Be honor, might, all by Him won,
Glory and praise! Amen! Amen!

O God, of good the unfathomed Sea!
Who would not give his heart to Thee?
Who would not love Thee with his might?
O Jesus, Lover of mankind,
Who would not his whole soul and mind,
With all his strength, to Thee unite?

O God of grace, thy mercy send;
Let thy protecting arm defend;
Save us and keep us to the end:
Have mercy, Lord.
And through the coming hours of night
Fill us, we pray, with holy light;
Keep us all sinless in thy sight:
Grant this, O Lord.
May some bright messenger abide
For ever by thy servant's side,
A faithful guardian and our guide:
Grant this, O Lord.
From every sin in mercy free;
Let heart and conscience stainless be,
That we may live henceforth for thee:
Grant this, O Lord.
We would not be by care opprest,
But in thy love and wisdom rest;
Give what thou seest to be best:
Grant this, O Lord.
While we of every sin repent,
Let our remaining years be spent
In holiness and sweet content:
Grant this, O Lord.
And when the end of life is near,
May we, unshamed and void of fear,
Wait for the judgement to appear:
Grant this, O Lord.

O God of grace and righteousness,
Hear and attend when I complain;
Thou hast enlarged me in distress,
Bow down a gracious ear again.

O God of hosts, the mighty Lord,
How lovely is the place
Where Thou, enthroned in glory, show’st,
The brightness of Thy face.

O God of Hosts, with Thy strong hand,
Protect the sons of our fair land;
Be Thou our Shield in war or peace,
And guide our steps till life shall cease.

O God of love, grant us Your peace,
Within each restless mind.
May all our inner turmoil cease,
God show us how to find
Your quiet rest, Your still, small voice,
Your light upon life’s way,
To walk with you our humble choice,
God give us grace to pray.

O God of love, O King of Peace,
Make wars throughout the world to cease;
The wrath of sinful men restrain,
Give peace, O God, give peace again!

O God of mercy, God of might,
In love and pity infinite,
Teach us, as ever in Thy sight,
To live our life to Thee.

O God of mercy! hearken now
Before Thy throne we humbly bow;
With heart and voice to Thee we cry
For all on earth who suffering lie.

O God of truth, Whose living Word
Upholds whate’er hath breath,
Look down on Thy creation, Lord,
Enslaved by sin and death.

O God of truth, O Lord of might,
Who ord’rest time and change aright,
Bright’ning the morn with golden gleams,
Kindling the noonday’s fiery beams.

O God of our forefathers, hear,
And make thy faithful mercies known;
To thee through Jesus we draw near,
Thy suffering, well-beloved Son,
In whom thy smiling face we see,
In whom thou art well pleased with me.
With solemn faith we offer up,
And spread before thy glorious eyes,
That only ground of all our hope,
That precious, bleeding sacrifice,
Which brings thy grace on sinners down,
And perfects all our souls in one.
Acceptance through his only name,
Forgiveness in his blood, we have;
But more abundant life we claim
Through him who died our souls to save,
To sanctify us by his blood,
And fill with all the life of God.
Father, behold thy dying Son,
And hear the blood that speaks above;
On us let all thy grace be shown,
Peace, righteousness, and joy, and love -
Thy kingdom - come to every heart,
And all thou hast, and all thou art.

O God the Son eternal, thy dread might
sent forth Saint Michael and the hosts of heaven,
and from the realms of light
cast down in burning fight
Satan's rebellious hosts, to darkness given.
Thine angels, Lord, we bless with thankful lays,
dwelling with thee above yon depths of sky:
who, 'mid thy glory's blaze,
heaven's ceaseless anthems raise,
and gird thy throne in faithful ministry.
We celebrate their love, whose viewless wing
hath left for us so oft their mansion high,
the mercies of their King
to mortal saints to bring,
or guard the couch of slumbering infancy.
But thee, the First and Last, we glorify,
who, when thy world was sunk in death and sin,
not with thine hierarchy,
the armies of the sky,
but didst with thine own arm the battle win.
Therefore with angels and archangels we
to thy dear love our thankful raise,
and tune our songs to thee,
who art and art to be;
and, endless as thy mercies, sound thy praise!

O God, the world's sustaining force,
thyself unmoved, all motion's source,
who, from the morn till evening's ray,
dost through its changes guide the day;
O grant us light at eventide,
that life may unimpaired abide,
and that a holy death may be
the door of immortality.
Almighty Father, hear our cry
through Jesus Christ our Lord most high,
who with the Holy Ghost and thee
doth live and reign eternally.

O God, Thou bottomless abyss!
Thee to perfection who can know?
O height immense! What words suffice
Thy countless attributes to show?

O God, whom neither time nor space
can limit, hold, or bind,
look down from heaven, thy dwelling place,
with love for humankind.
Another year its course has run;
thy loving care renew:
forgive the ill that we have done,
the good we failed to do.
In doubt or danger, all our days,
be near to guard us still;
let all our thoughts and all our ways
be governed by thy will.
O help us here on earth to live
from selfish passions free;
to us at last in mercy give
eternal life with thee.

O God, your constant care and love
are shed upon us from above
throughout our lives, in every stage,
from infancy to later age.
We thank you, Lord, for dreams of youth,
for wisdom leading on to truth,
for memories gathered through the years,
and faith that grows from joys and tears.
All time is yours, O Lord, to give;
may we, in all the years we live,
find every day of life is new,
a celebration, Lord, with you.
Let not the passing of the years
rob us of joy nor cause us fears;
and give us faith, O Lord, that we
may live with you eternally.

O God, before whose altar
The stars like tapers burn,
At whose inscrutable decree
The planets wheel and turn,
Though earth and sea and heaven
Unite thy praise to sing,
Man in his weakness yet may give
A worthier offering.
Those who gave up life's bounty
To serve a race to be,
Whose bones lie white along the trail
Which leads the world to thee;
Those who when fears beset them
Stand fast and fight and die,
Their unconsidered lives go up
Like incense to the sky.
All those oppressed or lonely
Or long at strife with pain,
Who face the darkness undismayed
And turn their loss to gain,
Those who with love and meekness
Outlast the years of wrong,
Their silent courage pleads to heaven
More eloquent than song.
O Lord, be ours the glory
Beyond all earthly fame,
Like those to conquer for thy sake
Despair and doubt and shame;
Till through a world made noble,
Through lands from sin set free,
The armies of the living God
Shall march to victory.

O God, in this thine hour of grace,
With needy heart and empty hand,
Yet bidden of thee to seek thy face,
For blessing at thy feet we stand.
Ours are the vows, the frail desires,
The high resolve to dare and do;
Our flickering faith to thee aspires,
And passes like the morning dew.
Ours is the mighty need of the -
How great, thy love alone can know;
Ours but the hunger and the plea
That strives and will not let thee go.
Thy word we clasp, thy touch we wait;
Our eyes, O God, are unto thee,
Whose loving-kindness makes us great,
Whose strength shall seal our victory.

Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

O God, our Maker, throned on high,
The earth is Thine, and Thine the sky,
Th’adoring sun obeys Thy will,
And countless stars Thy laws fulfill.

O God, our strength, to Thee our song
With grateful hearts we raise;
To Thee, and Thee alone, belong
All worship, love and praise.

O God, our words cannot express
The pain we feel this day.
Enraged, uncertain, we confess
Our need to bow and pray.

O God, preserve me, for in Thee
Alone my trust has stood;
My soul has said, Thou art my Lord,
My chief and only good.

O God, regard my humble plea;
I cannot be so far from Thee
But Thou wilt hear my cry;
When I by trouble am distressed,
Then lead me on the Rock to rest
That higher is than I.

O God the deep immutable, the changeless, wise 
and still,
You’re the absolute, eternal One; You wield the 
sovereign will.
Deep Heav’n itself and even time must bend 
beneath your sway.
With a whispered thought you banish night in a 
flash of blinding day.

O God, the God that saveth me,
Remove my guilty stains,
And I will sing Thy righteousness
In grateful, joyous praise.

O God, the help of all Thy saints,
Our hope in time of ill:
We trust Thee, though Thy face be hid,
And seek Thy presence still.

O God, the joy of Heav’n above,
Thou didst not need Thy creatures’ love,
When from Thy secret place of rest
Thy Word the earth’s foundations blest.

O God, the Rock of Ages,
Who evermore hast been,
What time the tempest rages,
Our dwelling place serene:
Before Thy first creations,
O Lord, the same as now,
To endless generations,
The everlasting Thou.

O God, Thou art my God alone;
Early to Thee my soul shall cry;
A pilgrim in a land unknown,
A thirsty land whose springs are dry.

O God, Thou art our King of old,
Salvation Thou hast wrought;
In safety through the mighty sea
Our fathers Thou hast brought.

O God, Thou art the Father
Of all that have believed;
From whom all hosts of angels
Have life and power received.
O God, thou art the Maker
Of all created things,
The righteous Judge of judges,
Th’almighty King of kings.

O God, Thou faithful God,
Thou fountain ever flowing,
Without whom nothing is,
All perfect gifts bestowing,
Grant me a healthy frame,
And give me, Lord, within,
A conscience free from blame,
A soul unhurt by gain.

O God, Thou Giver of all good;
Thy children live by daily food;
And daily must the prayer be said,
“Give us this day our daily bread."

O God, Thou hast rejected us,
And hast afflicted sore;
Thou hast been angry, but in grace
O once again restore.

O God, Thou high and lofty One,
Transcending all the rolling spheres,
Who wast, and art, and art to come,
The same through everlasting years.
Thee would we worship and adore,
Thy Name extol forevermore.

O God, though countless worlds of light,
Thy power and glory show,
Though round Thy throne, above all height,
Immortal seraphs glow—

O God, Thy power is wonderful,
Thy glory passing bright;
Thy wisdom, with its deep on deep,
A rapture to the sight.

O God, Thy righteousness we own;
Judgment is at Thy house begun!
With humble awe Thy rod we hear,
And guilty in Thy sight appear;
We cannot in Thy judgment stand,
But sink beneath Thy mighty hand.

O God, Thy soldiers’ crown and guard,
And their exceeding great reward;
From all transgressions set us free,
Who sing Thy martyr’s victory.

O God, Thy soldiers’ great Reward,
Their Portion, Crown, and faithful Lord,
From all transgressions set us free
Who sing Thy martyr’s victory.

O God, Thy world is sweet with prayer;
The breath of Christ is in the air;
We rise on Thy free Spirit’s wings,
And every thought within us sings.

O God, to know that Thou art just
Gives hope and peace within;
We could not in a mercy trust
Which takes no count of sin.

O God, to Thine anointed King
Give truth and righteousness;
Thy people He will justly judge
And give the poor redress.
Then every fruitful mountainside
Shall yield its rich increase,
And righteousness in all the land
Shall bear the fruit of peace.

O God, to us show mercy and bless us in 
Thy grace;
Cause Thou to shine upon us the brightness 
of Thy face;
That so Thy way most holy on earth may 
soon be known,
And unto every people Thy saving grace be 
shown.

O God, unseen yet ever near,
Thy presence may we feel;
And thus inspired with holy fear,
Before Thine altar kneel.

O God, we have heard, and our fathers have 
told
What wonders Thou didst in the great days 
of old;
The nations were crushed and expelled by 
Thy hand,
Cast out that Thy people might dwell in 
their land.

O God, we praise Thee, and confess
That Thou the only Lord
And everlasting Father art,
By all the earth adored.

O God, we pray for all mankind,
The nations far astray;
We plead that all Thy grace may find,
In this Thy gracious day,
In this Thy gracious day.

O God, what offering shall I give
To thee, the Lord of earth and skies?
My spirit, soul, and flesh receive,
A holy, living sacrifice:
Small as it is, 'tis all my store;
More shouldst thou have, if I had more.
Now, O my God, thou hast my soul,
No longer mine, but thine I am;
Guard thou thine own, possess it whole,
Cheer it with hope, with love inflame;
Thou hast my spirit, there display
Thy glory to the perfect day.
Thou hast my flesh, thy hallowed shrine,
Devoted solely to thy will;
Here let thy light for ever shine,
This house still let thy presence fill;
O source of life, live, dwell, and move
In me, till all my life be love!
Send down thy likeness from above,
And let this my adorning be;
Clothe me with wisdom, patience, love,
With lowliness and purity,
Than gold and pearls more precious far,
And brighter than the morning star.
Lord, arm me with thy Spirit's might,
Since I am called by thy great name;
In thee let all my thoughts unite,
Of all my works be thou the aim:
Thy love attend me all my days,
And my sole business be thy praise.

O God, Who didst Thy will unfold
In wondrous modes to saints of old,
By dream, by oracle, or seer,
Wilt Thou not still Thy people hear?

O God, Who metest in Thine hand
The waters of the mighty sea,
And barrest ocean with the sand
By Thy perpetual decree:

O God, Whom I delight to praise,
To Thee my cry for help I raise;
Be Thou my Friend and Advocate
When foes assail with bitter hate.

O God, Whose law from age to age
No chance or change can know,
Whose love forevermore abides,
While eons come and go;
From all the strife of earthly life,
To Thine embrace we flee,
And ’mid our crowding doubts and fears
Would put our trust in Thee.

O God, Whose love is over all
The children of Thy grace,
Whose rich and tender blessings fall
On every age and place,
Hear Thou the songs and prayers we raise
In eager joy to Thee,
And teach us, as we sound Thy praise,
In all things Thee to see.

O God, whose mighty works of old
Our fathers to their sons have told,
Be with us still from age to age,
Our children's children's heritage.
Thine are the kingdoms: at thy feet
All peoples of the earth do meet
In equal lowliness of prayer
To find thine equal pity there.
Thy strength made strong our father's hands,
A people great on seas and lands,
To win, till earth shall pass away,
Such honour as the earth can pay.
Be with their children: give us grace
To know, nor fear to hold, their place,
Nor meanly shrink, nor boast at ease -
A people great on lands and seas.
Keep thou our boyhood free and fair
And quick to help and brave to dare:
From greed and selfishness and shame
Guard thou, O Lord, the English name.
Keep thou our girlhood fair and free
In mirth and love and modesty:
From ugly thought and deed and word
Guard thou our English homes, O Lord.
O God, whose mighty works of old
Our fathers to their sons have told,
Be thou our strength from age to age,
Our children's children's heritage.

O God, whose smile is in the sky,
Whose path is in the sea,
Once more from earth’s tumultuous strife
We gladly turn to Thee.

O God, whose will is life and good
for all of mortal breath,
unite in bonds of brotherhood
all those who fight with death.
Make strong their hands and hearts and wills
to drive disease afar,
to battle with the body's ills,
and wage thy holy war.
Where'er they heal the sick and blind,
Christ's love may they proclaim;
make known the good Physician's mind,
and prove the Saviour's name.
Before them set thy holy will,
that they, with heart and soul,
to thee may consecrate their skill,
and make the sufferer whole.

O God, within Whose sight
All men have equal right
To worship Thee,
Break every bar that holds
Thy flock in diverse folds;
Thy will from none withholds
Full liberty.

O golden day, when light shall break,
And dawn’s bright glories shall unfold,
When He Who knows the path I take
Shall ope for me the gates of gold!
Earth’s little while will soon be past,
My pilgrim song will soon be over,
The grace that saves shall time outlast,
And be my theme on yonder shore.

O golden day! so long desired,
Born of a darksome night,
Soon shall the waiting earth be fired
With thy resplendent light;
Soon shall resound the joyous word
O’er hill and vale and sea,
“One Master, Christ; one Sovereign Lord,
And brethren all are we."

O! golden Hereafter, thine every bright 
rafter
Will shake in the thunder of sanctified 
song;
And every swift angel proclaim an 
evangel,
To summon God’s saints to the glorified 
throng.

O gracious Father of mankind,
Our spirits’ unseen Friend,
High Heaven’s Lord, our hearts’ dear 
Guest,
To Thee our prayers ascend.
Thou dost not wait till human speech
Thy gifts divine implore;
Our dreams, our aims, our work, our 
lives
Are prayers Thou lovest more.

O gracious God, forsake me not,
When I am old and gray,
That unto those that follow me
I may Thy might display.

O grant us light, that we may know
The wisdom Thou alone canst give,
That truth may guide where’er we go,
And virtue bless where’er we live.

O great God of nations, revive us, we 
pray,
Raise prodigal hearts to contrition 
today;
In pride have we turned from Your life 
giving Word,
Embracing the darkness while truth goes 
unheard.
Create deep within us a clean heart 
today,
Renew a right spirit, and teach us to 
say:
Awaken, my soul, and send anthems above,
To Him Who is yearning to bless you in 
love.

There’s a story that’s been told, Hallelujah!
Of a Savior and His precious love;
How He died to make us free, Hallelujah!
That we all might go and live with Him above.

O happy band of pilgrims,
If onward you will tread,
With Jesus as your Fellow,
To Jesus as your Head.

O happy day, that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

O happy day, when first was poured
The blood of our redeeming Lord!
O happy day, when first began
His sufferings for sinful man!

O Happy day, when saints shall meet,
To part no more! the thought is sweet!
No more to feel the rending smart,
Oft felt below when Christians part.
O happy place! I still must say,
Where all but love is done away;
All cause of parting there is past,
Their social feast will ever last.
Such union here is sought in vain,
As there in ev'ry heart shall reign;
There separation can't compel
The saint to bid the sad farewell
On earth, when friends, together meet,
And find the passing movements sweet,
Time's rapid moments soon compel
With grief to say, Dear friends, farewell.
The happy season soon will come,
When saints shall meet in heav'n, their home;
Eternally with Christ to dwell,
Nor ever hear the sound Farewell.

O happy home, where Thou art loved the dearest,
Thou loving Friend and Savior of our race,
And where among the guests there never cometh
One who can hold such high and honored place!

O happy is the man who hears
Instruction’s warning voice;
And who celestial Wisdom makes
His early, only choice.

O happy soul that lives on high
While men lie groveling here!
His hopes are fixed above the sky,
And faith forbids his fear.

O Happy time, long waited for,
The comfort of my heart,
Since I have met the saints once more
May we in union part.
Temptations cease to break my peace,
And all my sorrows die;
When I with you my love renew,
O what a heav'n have I.
My sorrows past, and I at last
Have heav'nly comforts found,
My heart and treasure is above,
And I for heaven bound.
If fellowship with saints below
Is to our souls so sweet,
What heav'nly raptures shall we know
When round the throne we meet?
While here we sit and sing his love
With raptures so divine,
Our joys are more like theirs above,
While in their songs we join.
Our hearts are filled with holy zeal,
We long to see the King
We long to see those heav'nly hills,
Where saints and angels sing.

O have you not heard of that beautiful stream
That flows through our Father’s land?
Its waters gleam bright in the heavenly light,
And ripple o’er golden sand.

O hear my cry, be gracious now to me,
Come, Great Deliverer, come;
My soul bowed down is longing now for Thee,
Come, Great Deliverer, come.

O hear them marching, marching,
The legions of good will,
The men of peace who seek not
To bomb and maim and kill;
They march not to their conquest
With battle flags unfurled;
But with their gentle spirit
They shall subdue the world.

O hearken ye who 
would believe,
the gracious tidings now receive:
Gloria! Gloria
in excelsis Deo!

O heavenly Jerusalem,
Of everlasting halls,
Thrice blessed are the people
Thou storest in thy walls.

O heavenly King, look down from above;
Assist us to sing thy mercy and love:
So sweetly o'erflowing, so plenteous the store,
Thou still art bestowing, and giving us more.
O God of our life, we hallow thy name;
Our business and strife is thee to proclaim.
Accept our thanksgiving for creating grace;
The living, the living shall show forth thy praise.
Our Father and Lord, almighty art thou;
Preserved by thy word, we worship thee now;
The bountiful donor of all we enjoy,
Our tongues to thine honour, and lives we employ.
But O above all, thy kindness we praise,
From sin and from thrall which saves the lost race;
Thy Son thou hast given the world to redeem,
And bring us to heaven whose trust is in him.
Wherefore of thy love we sing and rejoice,
With angels above we lift up our voice;
Thy love each believer shall gladly adore,
For ever and ever, when time is no more.

O help us, Lord, each hour of need
Thy heavenly succor give;
Help us in thought, and word, and deed,
Each hour on earth we live.

Thou “Word Incarnate," “truth so divine,"
Thou dost illumine each path of mine.
Never a sorrow can e’er abide,
While in thy refuge in safety I hide.

O holy city, seen of John,
Where Christ the Lamb, doth reign,
Within whose foursquare walls shall come
No night, nor need, nor pain,
And where the tears are wiped from eyes
That shall not weep again.

O holy Father, Who in tender love
Didst give Thine only Son for us to die,
The while He pleads at Thy right hand above,
We in one Spirit now with faith draw nigh,
And, as we eat this bread and drink this wine,
Plead His once offered sacrifice divine.

O Holy Ghost, Thy people bless
Who long to feel Thy might,
And fain would grow in holiness
As children of the light.

O holy, holy, holy, Lord!
Thou God of hosts, by all adored;
The earth and heavens are full of Thee;
Thy light, Thy power, Thy majesty.

O holy, holy, holy Lord,
Bright in Thy deeds and in Thy Name,
Forever be Thy Name adored,
Thy glories let the world proclaim.

O holy Lord, our God,
By heav’nly hosts adored,
Hear us, we pray;
To Thee the cherubim,
Angels and seraphim,
Unceasing praises hymn,
Their homage pay.

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of the dear Savior’s birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men from Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our trials born to be our Friend!
He knows our need—to our weakness is no stranger.
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy Name!
Christ is the Lord! O praise His name forever!
His pow’r and glory evermore proclaim!
His pow’r and glory evermore proclaim!

O holy Savior, Friend unseen,
The faint, the weak on Thee may lean,
Help me, throughout life’s varying 
scene,
By faith to cling to Thee.

O Holy Spirit, enter in,
Among these hearts Thy work begin,
Thy temple deign to make us;
Sun of the soul, Thou Light divine,
Around and in us brightly shine,
To strength and gladness wake us.
Where Thou shinest, life from Heaven
There is given; we before Thee
For that precious gift implore Thee.

O Holy Spirit, grant us grace
That we our Lord and Savior
In faith and fervent love embrace
And truly serve Him ever,
So that when death is drawing nigh,
We to His open wounds may fly
And find in them salvation.

O Holy Spirit, whom our Master sent
rich with all treasures from the throne above,
we pray thee for thy gift most excellent,
thy greatest, thine unfailing gift of love.
Thy grace abounds; the written word is ours;
and Satan trembles at the might of prayer:
the shield of faith can quell the evil powers,
and hope's bright helmet save us from despair.
These yet abide; but we would covet still
one gift, exalted faith and hope above;
grant us the new commandment to fulfill,
and even as Jesus loved us, so to love.
Grant us to follow his long-suffering path,
joying in truth, yet helping them that fall,
to think no evil, give no place to wrath,
but bear, believe, endure and hope for all.
So when at length we know as we are known,
and all the shadows are for ever past,
he who is Love may see in us his own,
and all in him be perfect love at last.

O how blest the hour, Lord Jesus,
When we can to thee draw near,
Promises so sweet and precious
From thy gracious lips to hear.
Be with us this day to bless us,
That we may not hear in vain;
With the saving truths impress us
Which the words of life contain.
Open thou our minds, and lead us
Safely on our heavenward way;
With the lamp of truth precede us,
That we may not go astray.
Make us gentle, meek, and humble,
And yet bold in doing right;
Scatter darkness, lest we stumble:
Safe our walking in the light.
Lord, endue thy word from heaven
With such light, and love, and power,
That in us its silent leaven
May work on from hour to hour.
Give us grace to bear our witness
To the truths we have embraced;
And let others both their sweetness
And their quickening virtue taste.

O how blest to be a pilgrim,
Guided by the Father’s hand;
Free at last from ev’ry 
burden
We shall enter Canaan’s land.

O how happy are they
Who the Savior obey,
And have laid up their 
treasure above!
Tongue cannot express
The sweet comfort and peace
Of a soul in its earliest 
love.

O how I love Thy holy 
law!
 ’Tis daily my delight;
And thence my meditations 
draw
Divine advice by night.

how light to 
the soul are 
its crosses,
And how easy 
our burdens to 
bear,
When we think 
of that land 
over Jordan,
And the joy 
that will crown 
us there.

O how shall I keep my Christmas?"
My heart whispered softly to me,
For I had been reading the story
Of the Lord’s nativity;
And slowly and clearly before me
The words like pictures rise,
And the scenes appear in the beauty
Of the starry Syrian skies.
O cradled He was in a manger!
For lowly and poor was He,
Whose throne is the splendors of heaven
Whose pow’r is infinity;
And He bore His cross to save us,
To save us from death and sin,
And He trod all alone the winepress
To make us pure and clean.
In glory the hosts of the angels
Came singing His song of praise,
And filling the heav’ns with their music
In those wonderful old days;
Singing “Glory to God in the highest!"
And “peace upon earth,"
And the mighty of voices
Pealed forth “Good will to all."
“O how shall I keep my Christmas?"
As they keep it in heaven above;
O keep it with peace and thanksgiving,
And kindliest deed of love;
And share with the poor and needy
The joys which the Lord gives thee;
And thy heart shall keep with the angels
The Lord’s nativity.

O how shall I receive Thee,
How greet Thee, Lord, aright?
All nations long to see Thee,
My Hope, my heart’s Delight!
O kindle, Lord, most holy,
Thy lamp within my breast,
To do in spirit lowly
All that may please Thee best.

O how shall I receive Thee,
How meet Thee on Thy way;
Blest Hope of every nation,
My soul’s Delight and Stay?
O Jesus, Jesus, give me,
By Thine illuming light,
To know whate’er is pleasing
And welcome in Thy sight.

O how the thought of God attracts
And draws the heart from earth
And sickens it of passing shows
And dissipating mirth!

O how well do I remember
How I doubted day by day, 
For I did not know for certain
That my sins were washed away.
When the Spirit tried to tell me,
I would not the truth receive;
I endeavored to be happy
And to make myself believe.

O I am singing of Jesus,
Happy as mortal can be;
How can I help but adore Him,
He is so gracious to me:
Holding me up when I falter,
Giving me light from His throne,
Cheering me on with His counsel,
Keeping my hand in His own?

O I love to tell the blessed story
Since the Lord sanctified me;
For my soul received a flood of glory
When the Lord sanctified me.

O I love to walk with Jesus
Like the publicans of old,
When He gathered them about Him
And the blessed tidings told;
How He came to bring deliverance
To the captives in distress,
Take away our ev’ry burden,
Giving perfect peace and rest.

As I journey thro’ the land, singing as I go,
Pointing souls to Calvary—to the crimson flow,
Many arrows pierce my soul from without, within;
But my Lord leads me on, thro’ Him I must win.

O Jehovah, hear my words,
To my thoughts attentive be;
Hear my cry, my King, my God,
I will make my prayer to Thee.
With the morning light, O Lord,
Thou shalt hear my voice arise,
And expectant I shall bring
Prayer as morning sacrifice.

O Jerusalem the blissful, home of gladness yet untold,
Thou whose countless throngs triumphal fill with joy thy street of gold
Graven on thee, new and glorious, they the King’s own Name behold!

O Jesu, Thou the beauty art
Of angel worlds above;
Thy Name is music to the heart,
Enchanting it with love.

O Jesu, thou the Virgin's crown,
Thy gracious ear to us bow down,
Born of that Virgin whom alone
The Mother and the Maid we own.
In thee, their Bridegroom and their Lord,
The virgins find their bright reward,
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps wend
With hymns and praises thee attend.
O gracious Lord, we thee implore
Thy grace into our minds to pour;
From all defilement keep us free,
And make us pure in heart for thee.
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to thee,
Whom with the Spirit we adore,
For ever and for evermore.

O Jesu, thou art standing
Outside the fast-closed door,
In lowly patience waiting
To pass the threshold o'er:
Shame on us, Christian brethren,
His name and sign who bear,
O shame, thrice shame upon us
To keep him standing there!
O Jesu, thou art knocking;
And lo, that hand is scarred,
And thorns thy brow encircle,
And tears thy face have marred:
O love that passeth knowledge,
So patiently to wait!
O sin that hath no equal
So fast to bar the gate!
O Jesu, thou art pleading
In accents meek and low,
 'I died for you, my children,
And will ye treat me so?'
O Lord, with shame and sorrow
We open now the door:
Dear Saviour, enter, enter,
And leave us nevermore.

O Jesus Christ, from thee began
this healing for the soul of man,
by fasting sought, by fasting found,
through forty days of yearly round;
That he who fell from high delight,
borne down to sensual appetite,
by dint of stern control may rise
to climb the hills of paradise.
Therefore, behold thy Church, O Lord,
and grace of penitence accord
to all who seek with generous tears
renewal of their wasted years.
Forgive the sin that we have done,
forgive the course that we have run,
and show henceforth in evil day
thyself our succor and our stay.
But now let every heart prepare,
by sacrifice of fast and prayer,
to keep with joy magnifical
the solemn Easter festival.
Father and Son and Spirit blest,
to thee be every prayer addressed,
who art in threefold Name adored,
from age to age, the only Lord.

O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,
And all things else recede!
My heart be daily nearer Thee,
From sin be daily freed.

O Jesu Christ, if aught there be
That, more than all beside,
In ever painful memory
Must in my heart abide,

O Jesus Christ, our Lord most dear,
As Thou wast once an Infant here
So give this child of Thine, we pray,
Thy grace and blessing day by day.

O Jesus, crowned with all renown,
Since Thou the earth hast trod,
Thou reignest, and by Thee come down
Henceforth the gifts of God.
Thine is the health and Thine the wealth
That in our halls abound,
And Thine the beauty and the joy
With which the years are crowned.

O Jesu, crucified for man,
O Lamb, all glorious on Thy throne,
Teach Thou our wondering souls to scan
The mystery of Thy love unknown.

O JESUS, full of truth and grace,
O all-atoning Lamb of God,
I wait to see thy glorious face,
I seek redemption through thy blood.

O 
Jesus, I have promised
To serve thee to the end;
Be thou for ever near me,
My Master and my Friend:
I shall not fear the battle
If thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway
If thou wilt be my guide.
O let me feel thee near me:
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear;
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
But, Jesus, draw thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.
O let me hear thee speaking
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will;
O speak to reassure me,
To hasten or control;
O speak, and make me listen,
Thou guardian of my soul.
O Jesus, thou hast promised
To all who follow thee,
That where thou art in glory
There shall thy servant be;
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve thee to the end:
O give me grace to follow,
My Master and my friend.
O let me see thy foot-marks,
And in them plant mine own;
My hope to follow duly
Is in thy strength alone:
O guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end;
And then in heaven receive me,
My Saviour and my friend.

O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!
Forgive me if I say,
For very love, Thy sacred Name
A thousand times a day.

O Jesus, King most wonderful,
Thou Conqueror renowned,
Thou Sweetness most ineffable,
In Whom all joys are found!

O Jesus, King of Glory,
Both David’s Lord and Son!
Thy realm endures forever,
In Heav’n is fixed Thy throne.
Help that in earth’s dominions,
Throughout from pole to pole,
Thy reign may spread salvation,
To each benighted soul.
The Eastern sages, bringing
Their tribute gifts to Thee,
Bear witness to Thy kingdom
And humbly bow the knee.
To Thee the star is pointing,
And the prophetic Word;
Hence joyously we hail Thee:
Our Savior and our Lord!
Thou art a mighty Monarch,
As by Thy Word is told,
Yet carest Thou but little
For earthly goods or gold;
On no proud steed Thou ridest,
Thou wear’st no jeweled crown
Nor dwell’st in lordly castle,
But bearest scoff and frown.
Yet art Thou decked with beauty,
With rays of glorious light;
Thy works proclaim Thy goodness,
And all Thy ways are right.
Vouchsafe to shield Thy people
With Thine almighty arm
That they may dwell in safety
From those who mean them harm.
Ah, look on me with pity
Though I am weak and poor;
Admit me to Thy kingdom
To dwell there, blest and sure.
I pray Thee, guide and keep me
Safe from my bitter foes,
From sin and death and Satan;
Free me from all my woes.
And bid Thy Word within me
Shine as the fairest star;
Keep sin and all false doctrine
Forever from me far.
Help me confess Thee truly
And with Thy Christendom
Here own Thee King and Savior
And in the world to come.

O Jesus, Lamb of God, Thou art
The Life and Comfort of my heart.
A sinner poor I come to Thee
And bring my many sins with me.

O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
The soul’s eternal King,
Grant now Thy grace and favor,
While we Thy praises sing!

O Jesus, Lord most merciful,
Low at Thy cross I lie;
O sinner’s Friend, most pitiful,
Hear my bewailing cry.
I come to Thee with mourning,
I come to Thee in woe;
With contrite heart returning,
And tears that overflow.

O Jesus, Lord of heavenly grace,
[

O Jesus my hope, for me offered up,
Who with clamor pursued Thee to Calvary’s top,
The blood Thou hast shed, for me let it plead,
And declare Thou hast died in Thy murderer’s stead.

O Jesus, once a Nazareth boy,
And tempted like as we,
All inward foes help us destroy
And spotless all to be.
We trust Thee for the grace to win
The high, victorious, goal,
Where purity shall conquer sin
In Christlike self control.

O Jesus, strong, and pure and true, 
before thy feet we bow;
the grace of earlier years renew, 
and lead us onward now.
The joyous life that year by year
within these walls is stored,
the golden hope, the gladsome cheer,
we bring to thee, O Lord.
Our faith endow with keener powers,
with warmer glow our love;
and draw these halting hearts of ours
from earth to things above.
In paths our bravest ones have trod 
O make us brave to go,
That we may give our lives to God 
in serving man below.
Scorn we the selfish aim or choice,
and love's high precept keep,
rejoice with those that do rejoice,
and weep with those that weep.
So hence shall flow fresh strength and grace,
as from a full-fed spring,
to make the world a better place,
and life a worthier thing.

O Jesus, Thou art standing, outside the fast closed door,
In lowly patience waiting to pass the threshold o’er:
Shame on us, Christian brothers, His Name and sign who bear,
O shame, thrice shame upon us, to keep Him standing there!

O Jesus, we adore Thee,
Upon the cross, our King!
We bow our hearts before Thee,
Thy gracious Name we sing.
That Name hath brought salvation,
That Name in life our stay,
Our peace, our consolation,
When life shall fade away.

O Jesus, when I think of Thee,
Thy manger, cross, and throne,
My spirit trusts exultingly
In Thee, and Thee alone.

O Jesus, Youth of Nazareth,
Preparing for the bitter strife,
Wilt Thou impart to every heart
Thy perfect purity of life?

O Jesus Christ, the Saviour,
We only look to Thee;
 'Tis in Thy love and favour
Our souls find liberty.
While Satan fiercely rages
And shipwreck oft we fear,
 'Tis this our grief assuages,
That Thou art always near.

O joy of God, that comest in the morning,
For thee, unsunned, we wait and eastward gaze,
Lift on our dark the splendours of thy dawning,
Flood all our being in the feast of praise.
O life of God, for whom our spirits hunger,
Except we eat and drink indeed of thee,
With love and faith renewed and hope grown younger
Send us out hence thy saving health to see.
O peace of God, that passest understanding,
Guard thou our heart through every fretting day:
In him who is our Peace, our wills commanding,
Direct our path and perfect all our way.

O joy, because the circling year
Hath brought our day of blessing here!
The day when first the light divine
Upon the church began to shine.
Like unto quivering tongues of flame
Upon each one the Spirit came:
Tongues, that the earth might hear their call,
And fire, that love might burn in all.
Thus unto all was spread abroad
The wonder of the works of God;
They knew the prophet's word fulfilled,
And owned the work which God had willed.
Of old in every hallowed breast
Thou camest in thy grace to rest:
O grant us now from sin release,
And in our time, good Lord, give peace.

O joyful sound of Gospel grace!
Christ shall in me appear;
I, even I, shall see His face,
I shall be holy here.

O joyous Easter morning,
That saw the Lord of love arise!
O bright and happy morning!
The clouds have left the skies.
The night of grief is ended,
The smiling day has come again,
And Christ has won the victory
For all the sons of men.

O kind Creator, bend Thine ear
To mark the cry, to know the tear
Before Thy throne of mercy spent
In this Thy holy fast of Lent.

O King most high of earth and sky
on prostrate death thou treadest,
and with thy blood dost mark the road
whereby to heaven thou leadest.
Christ, behold thine orphaned fold,
which thou hast borne with anguish,
steeped in the tide from thy rent side:
O leave us not to languish!
The glorious gain of all thy pain
henceforth dost thou inherit;
now comes the hour, then gently shower
on us thy promised Spirit!

O King of Glory! David’s Son!
Our Sovereign and our Friend!
In Heav’n forever stands Thy throne,
Thy kingdom hath no end:
Oh now to all men, far and near,
Lord, make it known, we pray,
That as in Heav’n all creatures here
May know Thee and obey.

O King of Glory! David’s Son!
Our Sovereign and our Friend!
In Heav’n forever stands Thy throne,
Thy kingdom hath no end:
Oh now to all men, far and near,
Lord, make it known, we pray,
That as in Heav’n all creatures here
May know Thee and obey.

O King of kings, O Lord of hosts, Whose throne is lifted high
Above the nations of the earth, the armies of the sky,
The spirits of perfected saints may give their nobler songs
And we, Thy children, worship Thee, to Whom all praise 
belongs.

O King of kings, whose reign of old
hath been from everlasting,
before whose throne their crowns of gold
the white-robed saints are casting;
while all the shining courts on high
with angel-songs are ringing,
O let thy children venture nigh,
their lowly homage bringing.
For every heart, made glad by thee,
with thankful praise is swelling;
and every tongue, with joy set free,
its happy theme is telling.
Thou hast been mindful of thine own,
and lo! we come confessing--
'tis thou hast dowered our Empire's throne
with countless years of blessing.
Lead on, O Lord, thy people still,
new grace and wisdom giving,
to larger love and purer will,
and nobler heights of living.
And while of all thy love below
they chant the glorious story,
O teach them first thy Christ to know,
and magnify his glory.

O Lamb of God, still keep me
Close to Thy pierced side;
 ’Tis only there in safety
And peace I can abide.
What foes and snares surround me,
What lusts and fears within!
The grace that sought and found me
Alone can keep me clean.

O Lamb of God, Whose love divine
Draws virgin souls to follow Thee;
And bids them earthly joys resign
If so they may Thy beauty see;

Land of rest, for thee I sigh;
When will the moment come,
When I shall lay my armour by,
And dwell with Christ at home?
No tranquil joys on earth I know,
No peaceful shelt'ring dome;
This world's a wilderness of woe;
This world is not my home.
To Jesus Christ I sought for rest;
He bade me cease to roam,
And fly for succor to his breast,
And he'd conduct me home.
I should at once have quit the field,
Where foes and fury roam;
But, ah! my passport was not sealed;
I could not yet go home.
When by affliction sharply tried,
I view the gaping tomb,
Although I dread death's chilling tide,
Yet still I sigh for home.
Weary of wand'ring round and round
This vale of sin and gloom,
I long to leave th' unhallowed ground,
And dwell with Christ at home.

O lead my blindness by the hand,
Lead me to Thy familiar feast,
Not here or now to understand,
Yet even here and now to taste,
How the eternal Word of Heav’n
On earth in broken bread is giv’n.

O let him whose sorrow no relief can find,
Trust in God, and borrow ease for heart and mind.
Where the mourner weeping sheds the secret tear,
God His watch is keeping, though none else is near.

O let me walk with Thee, my God,
As Enoch walked in days of old;
Place Thou my trembling hand in Thine,
And sweet communion with me hold;
E’en though the path I may not see,
Yet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.

O let my supplicating cry
By Thee, my gracious Lord, be heard;
Give wisdom and deliver me
According to Thy faithful Word.

O let the heart beat high with bliss,
Yea, let it triumph at the sound
Of Jesu’s Name, so sweet it is,
For every joy therein is found.

O, let the light stream in,
The glorious light of day,
That o’er the face of nature sheds
A bright and genial ray;
We need its beams our steps to guide,
Ere daily toils begin,
Then open wide the door of prayer,
And let the light stream in.
Let the light stream in,
Let the light stream in,
Then open wide the door of prayer,
And let the light stream in.

O Life that makest all things new,
The blooming earth, the thoughts of men,
Our pilgrim feet, wet with Thy dew,
In gladness hither turn again.

O Light, from age to age the same,
O ever living Word,
Here have we felt Thy kindling flame,
Thy voice within have heard.

O Light of life, O Savior dear,
Before we sleep, bow down Thine ear;
Through dark and day, o’er land and sea,
We have no other hope but Thee.

O Light of light, by love inclined,
Jesus, Redeemer of mankind,
with loving-kindness deign to hear
from suppliant voices praise and prayer.
Thou who to raise our souls from hell
didst deign in fleshly form to dwell,
vouchsafe us, when our race is run,
in thy fair body to be one.
More bright than day thy face did show,
thy raiment whiter than the snow,
when on the mount to mortals blest
man's maker thou was manifest.
Two prophets, that had faith tosee,
with thine elect found company,
where unto each, divinely shown,
the Godhead veiled in form was known.
The heavens above his glory named,
the Father's voice his Son proclaimed;
to whom, the King of glory now,
all faithful hearts adoring bow.
May all who seek thy praise aright
through purer lives show forth thy light;
so to the brightness of the skies
by holy deeds our hearts shall rise.
Eternal God, to thee we raise,
the King of kings, our hymn of praise,
who Three in One and One in Three
doth live and reign eternally.

O Light of my spirit and Joy of my heart,
Thou Chief among thousands, how lovely Thou art!
I think of Thy goodness where’er I may be,
My Rock and Salvation, I live but for Thee.

O Light that knew no dawn,
That shines to endless day,
All things in earth and Heav’n
Are lustered by Thy ray;
No eye can to Thy throne ascend,
Nor mind Thy brightness comprehend.

O Light, Whose beams illumine all
From twilight dawn to perfect day,
Shine Thou before the shadows fall
That lead our wandering feet astray;
At morn and eve Thy radiance pour
That youth may love, and age adore.

O list to the music that floats on the air,
The valleys are smiling, the reapers are there;
The summer rewards us with plenty again;
Then thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.

0 little flock, fear not the Foe
Who madly seeks your overthrow;
Dread not his rage and power.
What though your courage sometimes faints,
His seeming triumph o'er God's saints
Lasts but a little hour.
Be of good cheer; your cause belongs
To Him who can avenge your wrongs;
Leave it to Him, our Lord.
Though hidden yet from mortal eyes,
His Gideon shall for you arise,
Uphold you and His Word.
As true as God's own Word is true.
Not earth nor hell with all their crew
Against us shall prevail.
A jest and byword are they grown;
God is with us, we are His own;
Our victory cannot fail.
Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer;
Great Captain, now Thine arm make bare,
Fight for us once again!
So shall Thy saints and martyrs raise
A mighty to Thy praise,
World without end.Amen.

O living Bread from heaven,
How hast Thou fed Thy guest!
The gifts Thou now hast given
Have filled my heart with rest.
O wondrous food of blessing,
O cup that heals our woes,
My heart, this gift possessing,
In thankful song o’erflows!

O Lord! and is Thy table spread,
And doth Thy cup with truth o’erflow?
Thither be all Thy children led,
And let them all its sweetness know.

O Lord and Master of us all,
Whate’er our name or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
We test our lives by Thine.

O Lord, be Thou my Helper true,
For just and godly men are few;
The faithful who can find?
From truth and wisdom men depart,
With flattering lips and double heart,
They speak their evil mind.

O Lord, be with us when we sail
Upon the lonely deep,
Our Guard, when on the silent deck
The midnight watch we keep.

O Lord, by Thee delivered, I Thee with songs extol;
My foes Thou hast not suffered to glory o’er my fall.
O Lord, my God, I sought Thee, and Thou didst heal and 
save;
Thou, Lord, from death didst ransom and keep me from the 
grave.

You know that my times are in your hands
O Lord, deliver me
And I praise you for your goodness as my soul demands
O Lord, deliver me

O Lord, enlarge our scanty thought
To know the wonders thou hast wrought;
Unloose our stammering tongues, to tell
Thy love immense, unsearchable.
What are our works but sin and death,
Till thou thy quickening Spirit breathe?
Thou giv'st the power thy grace to move:
O wondrous grace! O boundless love!
How can it be, thou heavenly King,
That thou shouldst us to glory bring;
Make slaves the partners of thy throne,
Decked with a never-fading crown?
Hence our hearts melt, our eyes o'erflow,
Our words are lost; nor will we know,
Nor will we think of aught beside,
My Lord, my Love is crucified!
First-born of many brethren thou;
To thee, lo! all our souls we bow;
To thee our hearts and hands we give;
Thine may we die, thine may we live!

O Lord, give ear unto my voice, when I do cry to Thee;
Upon me also mercy have, and do Thou answer me.
When Thou didst say, “Seek ye My face," then unto Thee 
reply
Thus did my heart, above all things Thy face, Lord, seek 
will I.

O Lord, give heed unto our plea,
O Spirit, grant Thy graces,
That we who put our trust in Thee
May rightly sing Thy praises.
Thy Word, O Christ, unto us give,
That grace and pow’r we may receive
To follow Thee, our Master.

O Lord, how are my foes increased!
Against me many rise;
How many say, in vain for help
He on his God relies.

O Lord! how happy should we be,
If we could leave our cares to Thee,
If we from self could rest;
And feel at heart that One above,
In perfect wisdom, perfect love,
Is working for the best.

O Lord, how joyful ’tis to see
The brethren join in love to Thee!
On Thee alone their heart relies
Their only strength Thy grace supplies.

O Lord, how manifold the works
In wisdom wrought by Thee;
The wealth of Thy creation fills
The earth and mighty sea.

O Lord, how many are my foes,
In this weak state of flesh and blood!
My peace they daily discompose,
But my defense and hope is God.

O Lord, how many they
Who deeply trouble me;
How greatly are they multiplied
Who do me injury.

O Lord, how shall I meet You, how welcome you aright?
Your people long to greet You, my Hope, my heart’s Delight!
O kindle, Lord most holy, a lamp within my breast,
To do in spirit lowly all that may please You best.

O Lord, I sing with lips and heart,
Joy of my soul, to Thee;
To earth Thy knowledge I impart
As it is known to me.

O Lord Jesus, I adore thee
For the bread of worth untold
Freely given in thy Communion,
Wonderful a thousandfold,
Given to-day in loving bounty
More than my poor heart can hold.
Make thou of my soul an orchard
Quickened into fruitfulness;
Come, O Come, life-giving Manna,
Making glad my wilderness:
Sweeter far than any sweetness
Tongue can taste, or words express.
Ah, Lord Jesus, go not from me,
Stay, ah, stay with me, my Lord;
Make me shrink from whatsoever
Will not with thy name accord;
Act through me in every action,
Speak through me in every word.
Would that I could keep thee always
In mine inmost heart to be,
Thou and only thou suggesting
Every thought and wish in me;
All my soul, with singing, offered
For a sacrifice to thee.

O Lord Jesus, Lamb of God,
Bearing such a heavy load;
Pain and suffering was Your fate—
Anguish, ridicule and hate.

O Lord, life is sacred, a gift from above;
Each person is worthy of honor and love.
Your works are so marvelous, we’re wonderfully made;
We each bear Your image, conception to grave.

O Lord, look down from Heaven, behold
And let Thy pity waken:
How few are we within Thy fold,
Thy saints by men forsaken!
True faith seems quenched on every hand,
Men suffer not Thy Word to stand;
Dark times have us o’ertaken.

O Lord, make haste to hear my cry,
To Thee I call, on Thee rely.
Incline to me a gracious ear,
And, when I call, in mercy hear.

O Lord most high, with all my heart
Thy wondrous works I will proclaim;
I will be glad and give Thee thanks
And sing the praises of Thy Name.

O Lord most high, eternal King,
By Thee redeemed Thy praise we sing;
The bonds of death are burst by Thee,
And grace has won the victory.

O Lord my God! how great art Thou!
With honor and with glory crowned;
Light’s dazzling splendors veil Thy brow,
And gird the universe around.

O Lord, my God, most earnestly
My heart would seek Thy face,
Within Thy holy house once more
To see Thy glorious grace.

O Lord, my inmost heart and thought
Thy searching eye doth see;
Where’er I rest, where’er I go,
My ways are known to Thee.

O Lord of all, to thee 
our hearts we raise,
Thee we adore, Thee we praise,
Holy and blessed be Thy great
    and glorious name for evermore
O Lord of all, Worthy art Thou;
To Thee, with gladness,
Earth's mighty sings with hosts above
Holy art Thou, Spirit of righteousness,
Thou art our refuge and strength in time of need.
O Lord of all, Praise be to thee;
Honour and blessing and wisdom are Thine O Lord,
And in Thy Love is everlasting peace.
Honour and blessing and wisdom are thine,
O Lord, forevermore.

O Lord of Heav’n and earth and sea,
To Thee all praise and glory be;
How shall we show our love to Thee,
Who givest all?

O Lord of hosts, almighty King,
Behold the sacrifice we bring:
To every arm Thy strength impart;
Thy Spirit shed through every heart.

O Lord of hosts, how lovely the 
place where Thou dost dwell!
Thy tabernacles holy in 
pleasantness excel.
My soul is longing, fainting, 
Jehovah’s courts to see;
My heart and flesh are crying, O 
living God for Thee.

O Lord of hosts, to Thee I cry,
Our fathers’ God, to Thee;
Let my petition reach Thine ear,
My prayer accepted be.
O God our Shield, look Thou on 
us,
Reveal Thyself in grace,
And let Thine own anointed one
Behold Thee face to face.

O Lord of hosts, Who didst 
upraise
Strong captains to defend the 
right,
In darker years and sterner 
days,
And armedst Israel for the 
fight;
Thou madest Joshua true and 
strong,
And David framed the battle 
song.

O Lord of hosts, Whose glory 
fills
The bounds of the eternal 
hills,
And yet vouchsafes, in 
Christian lands,
To dwell in temples made with 
hands;

O Lord of life, to Thee we 
lift our hearts in praise 
for those,
Thy prophets, who have 
shown Thy gift of grace 
that ever grows,
Of truth that spreads from 
shore to shore, of wisdom’s 
widening ray,
Of light that shineth more 
and more unto Thy perfect 
day.

O Lord of life, and love, 
and power,
How joyful life might be,
If in Thy service every 
hour
We lived and moved with 
Thee;
If youth in all its bloom 
and might
By Thee were sanctified,
And manhood found its 
chief delight
In working at Thy side!

O Lord of life, Thy 
kingdom is at hand,
Blest reign of love and 
liberty and light;
Time long foretold by 
seers of every land;
The cherished dream of 
watchers through the 
night.

O Lord of life, where’er they be,
Safe in Thine own eternity,
Our dead are living unto Thee:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

O Lord of Life, whose power sustains
The world unseen no less than this -
One family in him who reigns,
Triumphant over death, in bliss;
To thee with thankfulness we pray
For all our valiant dead to-day.
As nature's healing through the years
Reclothes the stricken battle-fields;
So mercy gives us joy for tears,
And grief to proud remembrance yields,
And mindful hearts are glad to keep
A tryst of love with them that sleep.
Not names engraved in marble make
The best memorials of the dead,
But burdens shouldered for their sake
And tasks completed in their stead;
A braver faith and stronger prayers,
Devouter worship, nobler cares.
O help us in the silence, Lord,
To hear the whispered call of love,
And day by day thy strength afford
Our work to do, our faith to prove.
So be thy blessing richly shed
On our communion with our dead.

O Lord, our Lord
How excellent Thy name
How excellent is Thy name in all the earth
Who has set Thy glory above the heavens!
We’ll praise Thy holy name for ever, evermore

O Lord, Thy work revive,
In Zion’s gloomy hour,
And make her dying graces live
By Thy restoring power.

O Lord, we welcome Thee,
Our hearts for joy are leaping.
Thou, Jesus, dearest Child,
Thy precious promise keeping,
Art come from heaven to earth
To be our Brother dear;
Thou gracious Son of God,
Wilt banish all our fear.

O Lord, who formedst me to wear
the image of thy Godhead here;
who soughtest me with tender care
through all my wanderings wild and drear:

0 Lord, whose bounteous hand again
Hath poured Thy gifts in plenty down,
Who all, creation dost sustain
And all the earth with goodness crown,
Lord of the harvest, here we own
Our joy to be Thy gift alone.

Incline to me a gracious ear,
And, when I call, in mercy hear.

O Lord, my earnest cry
Thy listening ear has heard;
With Thy salvation answer me,
And I will keep Thy Word.
At early dawn I prayed,
Thy promises my trust;
At night I thought upon Thy Word,
Most holy and most just.

O Lord, my God! I will keep on thanking 
You—forever
O, Father!
O Lord, my God! I will keep on thanking 
You—forever
O, Father!
You lift me up, You keep my enemies away.
My soul sings of your faithfulness!
You’re my Foundation, Lord, a rock that I 
can lean on.
Your Word will live forevermore!
I know, my Lord, that You have ransomed me 
from death.
O, help me never to forget!
Into Your hands do I commit my grateful 
spirit,
With You I will not be afraid!
O, Lord, my God, how You have filled my 
emptiness.
I’m like a stream, You’re like the rain.
O, Lord my God, now I can see Your plan for 
me—ev’rywhere I go, there You will be!

O Lord, my inmost heart and thought
Thy searching eye doth see;
Where’er I rest, where’er I go,
My ways are known to Thee.

O Lord, our Father, shall we be confounded
Who, though by trials and woes surrounded,
On Thee alone for help are still relying,
To Thee are crying?

Lord, our Father, thanks to Thee
In this new year we render,
For every evil had to flee
Before Thee, our Defender.
Our life was nourished, we were fed
With rich supplies of daily bread,
And peace reigned in our borders.

O Lord, our fathers oft have told,
In our attentive ears,
Thy wonders in their days performed,
And in more ancient years.

O Lord our God, arise!
The cause of truth maintain,
And wide o’er all the peopled world
Extend Thy blessed reign.

O Lord, our God, in adoration
We worship You and bend the knee,
With angel hosts our praises singing,
With longing eyes the Christ to see.

O Lord, our heav’nly King,
Thy Name is all divine;
Thy glories round the earth are spread,
And o’er the heav’ns they shine.

O Lord, our Lord
How excellent Thy name
How excellent is Thy name in all the earth
Who has set Thy glory above the heavens!
We’ll praise Thy holy name for ever, evermore

O Lord, our strength in weakness,
We pray to Thee for grace,
For power to fight the battle,
For speed to run the race;
When Thy baptismal waters
Were poured upon our brow,
We then were made Thy children
And pledged our earliest vow.

O Lord, regard me when I cry,
In mercy hear me when I speak;
Thou bidst me seek Thy face, and I
O Lord, with willing heart reply,
Thy face, Lord, will I seek.

O Lord, the holy innocents
Laid down for Thee their infant life,
And martyrs brave and patient saints
Have stood for Thee in fire and 
strife.

O Lord, Thou art my God and King;
Thee will I magnify and praise:
I will Thee bless, and gladly 
sing
Unto Thy holy Name always.

O Lord, Thou art my God and King,
And I will ever bless Thy Name.
I will extol Thee every day,
And evermore Thy praise proclaim.

O Lord, Thou hast ascended
On high in might to reign;
Captivity Thou leadest
A captive in Thy train.
Rich gifts to Thee are offered
By men who did rebel,
Who pray that now Jehovah
Their God with them may dwell.

O Lord, Thou Judge of all the 
earth,
To Whom all vengeance doth 
belong,
Arise and show Thy glory forth,
Requite the proud, condemn the 
wrong.

O Lord, Thy all discerning 
eyes
My inmost purpose see;
My deeds, my words, my 
thoughts, arise
Alike disclosed to Thee:
My sitting down, my rising 
up,
Broad noon, and deepest 
night,
My path, my pillow, and my 
cup,
Are open to Thy sight.

O Lord, Thy perfect 
righteousness
Is in Thy judgments shown;
In Thy unchanging 
faithfulness
Thy truth Thou hast made 
known.

O Lord, ’tis matter of 
high praise,
Thy Word on us doth 
shine,
But happy they who feel 
its rays,
And glorious power 
divine.

O Lord, to Thee I cry;
Thou art my Rock and 
Trust;
O be not silent, lest I 
die
And slumber in the 
dust.

O Lord, to Whom the 
spirits live
Of all the faithful 
passed away,
Unto their path that 
brightness give
Which shineth to the 
perfect day.

O Lord, to whom the spirits live
Of all the faithful passed away,
Unto their path that brightness give
Which shineth to the perfect day:
O Lamb of God, Redeemer blest,
Grant them eternal light and rest.

O Lord, turn not 
Thy face from me,
Who lie in woeful 
state,
Lamenting all my 
sinful life
Before Thy 
mercy-gate.

O Lord, we praise 
Thee, bless Thee, 
and adore Thee,
In thanksgiving 
bow before Thee.
Thou with Thy 
body and Thy 
blood didst 
nourish
Our weak souls 
that they may 
flourish.
O Lord, have 
mercy!
May Thy body, 
Lord, born of 
Mary
That our sins and 
sorrow did carry,
And Thy blood for 
us plead in all 
trial, fear and 
need:
O Lord, have 
mercy!

O Lord, while we 
confess the worth
Of this the 
outward seal,
Do Thou the 
truths herein set 
forth
To every heart 
reveal.

O Love divine 
and golden,
Mysterious 
depth and 
height,
To Thee the 
world beholden,
Looks up for 
life and light;
O Love divine 
and gentle,
The blesser and 
the blest,
Beneath Thy 
care parental
The world lies 
down in rest.

O love 
divine, how 
sweet thou 
art!
When shall I 
find my 
willing heart
All taken up 
by thee?
I thirst, I 
faint, I die 
to prove
The greatness 
of redeeming 
love,
The love of 
Christ to me.

O Love 
divine, 
that 
stooped to 
share
Our 
sharpest 
pang, our 
bitterest 
tear!
On Thee we 
cast each 
earthborn 
care;
We smile at 
pain while 
Thou art 
near.

O Love 
divine, 
what hast 
thou 
done!
The 
immortal 
God hath 
died for 
me!
The 
Father’s 
co-eternal 
Son
Bore all 
my sins 
upon the 
tree.
Th’immortal 
God for 
me hath 
died:
My Lord, 
my Love, 
is 
crucified!

O 
love 
of 
God, 
how 
strong 
and 
true!
Eternal, 
and 
yet 
ever 
new;
Uncomprehended 
and 
unbought,
Beyond 
all 
knowledge 
and 
all 
thought.

O 
love 
of 
God 
most 
full,
O 
love 
of 
God 
most 
free,
Come, 
warm 
my 
heart, 
come 
fill 
my 
soul,
Come, 
lead 
me 
unto 
Thee!

O Love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in thee;
I give thee back the life I owe,
That in thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.

O Love, Who formedst me to wear
The image of Thy Godhead here;
Who soughtest me with tender care
Thro’ all my wanderings wild and drear;
O Love, I give myself to Thee,
Thine ever, only Thine to be.

O love, 
how 
deep, 
how 
broad, 
how 
high,
It 
fills 
the 
heart 
with 
ecstasy,
That 
God, 
the Son 
of God, 
should 
take
Our 
mortal 
form 
for 
mortals’ 
sake!

O 
love 
of 
God, 
how 
strong 
and 
true!
Eternal, 
and 
yet 
ever 
new;
Uncomprehended 
and 
unbought,
Beyond 
all 
knowledge 
and 
all 
thought.

O 
Love! 
O 
Life! 
Our 
faith 
and 
sight
Thy 
presence 
maketh 
one,
As 
through 
transfigured 
clouds 
of 
white
We 
trace 
the 
noonday 
sun.

O loving Father, to thy care
We give again this child of thine,
Baptised and blessed with faithful prayer
And sealed with Love's victorious sign.
As Christ, thy Son, did not refuse
The homage of the children's cry,
So teach him childhood's gifts to use
Thy name to praise and magnify.
Through youth and age, through shine and shade,
Grant him to run his earthly race,
Forgetting not that man was made
To show thy glory and thy grace:
A loving child, a faithful friend,
A light in doubt and darkness given
To point the path that knows no end
Save in the fuller light of heaven;
Till, at the last, before thy throne
He lays his earthly armour down,
His task of loving service done,
And, in thy mercy, takes his crown.

O loving Lord, who art forever seeking
Those of thy mind, intent to do thy will,
Strong in thy strength, thy power and grace 
bespeaking,
Faithful to thee, through good report and ill -
To thee we come, and humbly make confession,
Faithless so oft, in thought and word and deed,
Asking that we may have, in true possession,
Thy free forgiveness in the hour of need.
In duties small be thou our inspiration,
In large affairs endue us with thy might;
Through faithful service cometh full salvation;
So may we serve, thy will our chief delight.
Not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
Faithful in all things, seeking not reward;
Then, following thee, may we fulfil our mission,
True to ourselves, our neighbours, and our Lord.

O magnify the Lord with me,
Ye people of His choice.
Let all to whom He lendeth breath
Now in His Name rejoice.
For love’s blest revelation,
For rest from condemnation,
For uttermost salvation,
To Him give thanks.

O magnify the Lord with me,
All ye that bear His Name;
His faithfulness and sovereignty
Forever are the same.

O Maker of the world, give ear;
In pitying love vouchsafe to hear
The prayers our contrite spirits raise
In this our fast of forty days.
All hearts are open unto thee;
Thou knowest each infirmity;
Now, as we turn to seek thy face,
Pour down on us thy pardoning grace.
Help us to grow in self-control,
To make the body serve the soul:
So may thy loving-kindness bless
Our fast with fruits of holiness.

O Maker of the mighty deep
Whereon our vessels fare,
Above our life’s adventure keep
Thy faithful watch and care.

O Maker of the sea and sky,
Whose word the stormy winds fulfill,
On the wide ocean Thou art nigh,
Bidding these hearts of ours be still.

O Maker of the world, give ear;
In pitying love vouchsafe to hear
The prayers our contrite spirits raise
In this our fast of forty days.
All hearts are open unto thee;
Thou knowest each infirmity;
Now, as we turn to seek thy face,
Pour down on us thy pardoning grace.
Help us to grow in self-control,
To make the body serve the soul:
So may thy loving-kindness bless
Our fast with fruits of holiness.

O Martyrs young and fresh as flowers,
Your day was in its morning hours
When Christ was sought and you were found
Like rain-strewn petals on the ground.
How weak to hurt you was the king!
You are Christ's morning offering,
His pretty lambs, his children, gay
With martyr-crowns and palms at play.
And you had cheated Herod's rage,
You little boys of Jesus' age;
For he whom Herod sought to slay,
Jesus, untouched escaped away.
Glory, O Christ the Lord to thee,
Child of the blessed Virgin, be,
Whom with the Father we adore
And Holy Spirit evermore.

O Mary don't you weep
Tell Martha not to moan
Pharaoh's army drowned in the Red Sea
O Mary don't you weep
Tell Martha not to moan

O Master of the waking world,
Who hast the nations in Thy heart,
The heart that bled and broke to send
God’s love to earth’s remotest part:
Show us anew in Calvary
The wondrous power that makes us free.

O Master Workman of the race, Thou Man of Galilee,
Who with the eyes of early youth eternal things did see,
We thank Thee for Thy boyhood faith that shone Thy whole life through;
“Did ye not know it is My work, My Father’s work to do?"

O Master, it is good to be
High on the mountain here with Thee,
Where stand revealed to mortal gaze
Those glorious saints of other days,
Who once received on Horeb’s height
Th’eternal laws of truth and right,
Or caught the still small whisper, higher
Than storm, than earthquake, or than fire.

O Master, let me walk with Thee,
In lowly paths of service free;
Tell me Thy secret; help me bear
The strain of toil, the fret of care.

O Master, when Thou callest,
No voice may say Thee nay,
For blest are they that follow
Where Thou dost lead the way;
In freshest prime of morning,
Or fullest glow of noon,
The note of heavenly warning
Can never come too soon.

O mean may seem this house of clay,
Yet ’twas the Lord’s abode;
Our feet may mourn this thorny way,
Yet here Emmanuel trod.

O merciful Creator, hear;
In tender pity bow Thine ear:
Accept the tearful prayer we raise
In this our fast of forty days.

O mercy divine, O couldst Thou incline,
My God, to become such as infant as mine?
What wonder of grace: The Ancient of Days
Is found in the likeness of Adam’s frail race!

O mighty cross,
Love lifted high
The Lord of life
raised there to die;
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross
a tree of life to me.
O mighty cross,
what throne of grace.
He knew no sin,
yet took my place;
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross
a tree of life to me.
O mighty cross,
O Christ so pure.
Love held Him there,
such shame endured;
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross
a tree of life to me.
O mighty cross,
my soul's release,
The stripes He bore,
have brought me peace;
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross
a tree of life to me.

O mighty man, why wilt thou boast
Thyself in hateful cruelty,
When God Almighty is most kind,
And ever merciful is He?

O mind of God, broad as the sky,
The earth, the air, the sea,
Give us Thy broadening Spirit’s grace,
In sweet simplicity.

O Morning Star, how fair and bright!
Thou beamest forth in truth and light,
O Sovereign meek and lowly!
Thou Root of Jesse, David’s Son,
My Lord and Master, Thou hast won
My heart to serve Thee solely!
Thou art holy,
Fair and glorious, all victorious, rich in blessing
Rule and might over all possessing.

O mother dear, Jerusalem,
When shall I come to thee?
When shall my sorrows have an end,
Thy joys when shall I see?
O happy harbor of the saints!
O sweet and pleasant soil!
In thee no sorrow may be found,
No grief, no care, no toil.

O Mother, will it always be,
That ev'ry passing year
Shall make thee seem more beautiful
Shall make thee grow more dear.

O my God, I fear Thee!
Thou art very high,
Yet to us, Thy children,
Thou art always nigh,
Far removed from mortal sight,
Dwelling in eternal light.

O my Savior, hear me,
Draw me close to Thee;
Thou hast paid my ransom,
Thou hast died for me;
Now by simple faith I claim
Pardon through Thy gracious Name;
Thou, my Ark of safety,
Let me fly to Thee.

O my Savior, lifted
From the earth for me,
Draw me, in Thy mercy,
Nearer unto Thee.

O my soul, bless God the Father;
All within me bless His Name;
Bless the Father, and forget not
All His mercies to proclaim.

O my soul, bless thou Jehovah,
All within me, bless His Name;
Bless Jehovah and forget not
All His mercies to proclaim.
He forgives all thy transgressions,
Heals thy sicknesses and pains;
He redeems thee from destruction,
And His love thy life sustains.

O mystery of love divine
That thought and thanks o’erpowers!
Lord Jesus, was our portion Thine,
And is Thy portion ours?

O north, with all thy vales of green,
O South, with all thy palms!
From peopled towns and vales between,
Uplift the voice of psalms;
Raise, ancient East, the anthem high,
And let the youthful West reply.

O One with God the Father,
In majesty and might,
The Brightness of His glory,
Eternal Light of Light,
O’er this our home of darkness
Thy rays are streaming now;
The shadows flee before Thee,
The world’s true Light art Thou.

O paradise! O paradise!
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy land
Where they that loved are blest.

O Paschal feast, what joy is thine!
We praise, dear Lord, Thy Name divine,
For Thou hast triumphed o’er the tomb;
No more we need to dread its gloom.

O precious word that Jesus 
said!
The soul that comes to Me,
I will in no wise cast him 
out,
Whoever he may be.
Whoever he may be,
Whoever he may be,
I will in no wise cast him 
out,
Whoever he may be.

O people blest, whose sons in youth,
In sturdy strength and noble truth,
Like plants in vigor spring;
Whose daughters fair, a queenly race,
Are like the cornerstones that grace
The palace of a king,
The palace of a king.

O perfect God, Thy love
As perfect Man did share
Here upon earth each form of ill
Thy fellow men must bear.

O perfect life of love!
All, all is finished now;
All that He left His throne above
To do for us below.

O perfect Love, all human thought 
transcending,
Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy throne,
That theirs may be the love which knows no 
ending,
Whom Thou forevermore dost join in one.

O power of love, all else transcending
In Jesus present evermore,
I worship Thee, in homage bending
Thy name to honor and adore;
Yea, let my soul, in deep devotion,
Bathe in love's mighty boundless ocean.
Thou art my rest, no earthly treasure
Can satisfy my yearning heart,
And naught can give to me the pleasure
I find in Thee, my chosen part,
Thy love, so tender, so possessing,
I joy to me, and every blessing.
To Thee my heart and life be given, 
Thou art in truth my highest good;
For me Thy sacred side was riven,
For me was shed Thy precious blood.
O Thou who art the world's salvation,
Be thine my love and adoration.

O praise our God today,
His constant mercy bless,
Whose love hath helped us on our way,
And granted us success.

O praise our great and gracious Lord,
And call upon His Name;
To strains of joy tune every chord,
His mighty acts proclaim;
Tell how He led His chosen race
To Canaan’s promised land;
Tell how His covenant of grace
Unchanged shall ever stand.

O praise the Lord, for He is good,
His mercies still endure;
Thus let His ransomed testify,
From all their foes secure.
He has redeemed His captive saints
From adversaries’ hands,
Has gathered them and brought them back
In peace from hostile lands.

O praise the Lord, ye servants of the Lord,
into his courts your joyful homage bring,
ye that within his holy temple stand
lift up your hands, lift up your voice and sing:
so shall ye have the blessing from your King.
He that hath made all heaven and all the worlds,
shall from that Zion where his saints adore
look down with favor, sanctify his Church,
bless them that tread his sanctuary floor,
and keep them in his ways for evermore.
All glory now to God the Father's Name;
Son everlasting, glory unto thee;
and, Holy Spirit, glory thine the same;
one God eternal, blessed Trinity,
as ever was and evermore shall be.

O praise the Lord, for He is good,
Let all in Heav’n above
And all His saints on earth proclaim
His everlasting love.
In my distress I called on God;
In grace He answered me,
Removed my bonds, enlarged my place,
From trouble set me free.

O praise the Lord, His deeds make 
known,
And call upon His Name;
Sing ye to Him, His praises sing,
His wondrous works proclaim.
Let hearts rejoice that seek the 
Lord,
His holy Name adore;
Seek ye Jehovah and His strength,
Seek Him forevermore.

O praise ye Name of Jehovah,
Proclaim ye His glory abroad;
O praise Him, ye servants 
appointed
To stand in the house of our 
God.

O praise ye the Lord and sing a 
new song,
Amid all His saints His praises 
prolong;
The praise of their Maker His 
people shall sing,
And children of Zion rejoice in 
their King.

O precious word that Jesus 
said!
The soul that comes to Me,
I will in no wise cast him 
out,
Whoever he may be.
Whoever he may be,
Whoever he may be,
I will in no wise cast him 
out,
Whoever he may be.

O Prince of Peace whose promised birth
the angels sang with "Peace on earth,"
peace be to us and all beside,
peace to us all--
peace to the world this Christmastide.
O Child who found to lay your head
no place but in a manger bed,
come where our doors stand open wide,
peace to us all--
peace to the world--
peace in our homes this Christmastide.
O Christ whom shepherds came to find,
their joy be ours in heart and mind;
let grief and care be laid aside,
peace to us all--
peace to the world--
peace in our homes--
peace in our hearts this Christmastide.
O Savior Christ, ascended Lord,
our risen Prince of Life restored,
our love who once for sinners died,
peace to us all--
peace to the world--
peace in our homes--
peace in our hearts--
peace with our God this Christmastide!

O quickly come, dread Judge 
of all,
For, awful though Thine 
advent be;
All shadows from the truth 
will fall,
And falsehood die, in sight 
of Thee.
O quickly come, for doubt 
and fear
Like clouds dissolve when 
Thou art near.

Oh realm of 
light! whose 
morning star
To Bethlehem’s 
manger led the 
way,
Not yet upon 
our longing 
eyes
Shines the full 
splendor of thy 
day:
Yet still 
across the 
centuries fall,
Both strong and 
sweet, our 
Lord’s command;
And still with 
steadfast faith 
we cry,
 “Behold, the 
kingdom is at 
hand!"

Oh, rejoice, ye 
Christians, loudly,
For our joy hath now begun;
Wondrous things our God hath done.
Tell abroad His goodness proudly
Who our race hath honored thus
That He deigns to dwell with us.
Joy O joy, beyond all gladness,
Christ hath done away with sadness!
Hence, all sorrow and repining,
For the Sun of Grace is shining!

O render thanks to God 
above,
The fountain of eternal 
love,
Whose mercy firm through 
ages past
Hath stood, and shall 
forever last.

O Rock of ages, one Foundation
On which the living Church doth rest -
The Church whose walls are strong salvation,
Whose gates are praise - thy name be blest.
Son of the living God, O call us
Once and again to follow thee;
And give us strength, whate'er befall us,
Thy true disciples still to be.
When fears appal and faith is failing,
Make thy voice heard o'er wind and wave;
And in thy perfect love prevailing
Put forth thy hand to help and save.
And if our coward hearts deny thee
In inmost thought, in deed or word,
Let not out hardiness still defy thee,
But with a look subdue us, Lord.
O strengthen thou our weak endeavour
Thee in thy sheep to serve and tend,
To give ourselves to thee for ever,
And find thee with us to the end.

O royal bride, give 
heed,
And to my words attend;
For Christ the King 
forsake the world
And every former 
friend.

O sacred Head, now 
wounded, with grief and 
shame weighed down,
Now scornfully 
surrounded with thorns, 
Thine only crown;
How pale Thou art with 
anguish, with sore 
abuse and scorn!
How does that visage 
languish, which once 
was bright as morn!

O Sacred Heart! O Love Divine!
Do keep us near to Thee;
And make our love so like to Thine
That we may holy be.

O sacred head, surrounded
by crown of piercing thorn!
O bleeding head, so wounded,
so shamed and put to scorn!
Death's pallid hue comes o'er thee,
the glow of life decays;
yet angel-hosts adore thee,
and tremble as they gaze.
Thy comeliness and vigour
is withered up and gone,
and in thy wasted figure
I see death drawing on.
O agony and dying!
O love to sinners free!
Jesu, all grace supplying,
turn thou thy face on me.
In this thy bitter passion,
good Shepherd, think of me
with thy most sweet compassion,
unworthy though I be:
beneath thy Cross abiding
for ever would I rest,
in thy dear love confiding,
and with thy presence blest.

O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
my soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
so sinful, so weary, thine, thine, would I be;
thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.

O saints of old, not yours alone
The search for God shall be;
We take the glory for our own;
Lord, we are seeking Thee.

O save me by Thy 
Name,
And judge me in Thy 
might,
O God, now grant my 
urgent claim
Acceptance in Thy 
sight.

O Savior Jesus, not alone
we plead for help before thy throne;
thy Mother's love shall aid our prayer
to win for us that healing care.
For souls defaulting supplicate
all orders of the angel state,
the patriarchs in line to thee,
the prophet's good company.
For souls in guilt ensnared pray
the Baptist, herald of thy way,
the wielder of the heavenly keys,
the apostolic witnesses.
For souls polluted intercede
thy martyrs, hallowed in their deed,
confessors high in priestly power,
and they who have the virgin dower.
Let all who served thy Church below,
and now thy heavenly freedom know,
give heed to help our lingering strife
and claim for us the crown of life.
To God the Father, God the Son,
and God the Spirit, Three in One,
all honor, praise and glory be
from age to age eternally.

O Savior, where shall guilty man
Find rest except in Thee?
Thine was the warfare with his foe,
The cross of pain, the cup of woe,
And Thine the victory.

O Savior, Lord, to Thee we pray,
Whose love has kept us safe today,
Protect us through the coming night,
And ever save us by Thy might.

O Savior, precious Savior,
Whom yet unseen we love!
O Name of might and favor,
All other names above!
We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
We praise Thee, and confess Thee
Our holy Lord and King.

O Savior! when Thy loving hand
Has brought us o’er the sea,
Through perils many, safe to land—
The land we longed to see.

O Savior, Who for man hast trod
The winepress of the wrath of God,
Ascend, and claim again on high
Thy glory left for us to die.

O Savior, Whom this holy morn
Gave to our world below;
To mortal want and labor born,
And more than mortal woe.

O Savior, may we never rest
Till Thou art formed within,
Till Thou hast calmed our troubled breast,
And crushed the power of sin.

O scorned and outcast Lord, beneath
Thy burden meekly bending,
Thou, our true Isaac, to Thy death
Art wearily ascending.

O seek the Lord in prayer
And fall down at Christ’s feet,
As two or three are gathered there,
Entreaties shall Christ meet!
Be whole! Be well! Be holy in the Lord!

O send thy light forth and thy truth;
Let them be guides to me,
And bring me to thy holy hill,
E'en where thy dwellings be.
Then will I to God's altar go,
To God my chiefest joy;
Yea, God, my God, thy name to praise
My harp I will employ.
Why art thou then cast down, my soul?
What should discourage thee?
And why with vexing thoughts art thou
Disquieted in me?
Still trust in God; for him to praise
Good cause I yet shall have;
He of my count'nance is the health,
My God that doth me save.

O Shepherd of the nameless fold,
The blessed Church to be,
Our hearts with love and longing turn
To find their rest in Thee;
 “Thy kingdom come," its heav’nly walls
Unseen around us rise,
And deep in loving human hearts
Its broad foundations rise.

O Shepherd of the sheep,
High Priest of things to come,
Who didst in grace Thy servant keep,
And take him safely home;

O show me not my Savior dying,
As on the cross He bled;
Nor in the tomb, a captive lying,
For He has left the dead.
Then bid me not that form extended
For my Redeemer own,
Who, to the highest heavens 
ascended,
In glory fills the throne.

O sing a new song to the Lord;
Sing all, the earth, to God,
To God sing, bless His Name, show 
still
His saving health abroad.

O sing a song of Bethlehem, of 
shepherds watching there,
And of the news that came to them 
from angels in the air.
The light that shone on Bethlehem 
fills all the world today;
Of Jesus’ birth and peace on 
earth the angels sing alway.

O sing His praise, Who governs earth and sky;
Sing His tender mercy, ever nigh;
Sing of the love that ransoms man from sin,
Love that conquered death, our souls to win.

O sing to me of Heav'n
When I am called to die;
Sing songs of holy ecstasy,
To waft my soul on high.

O sing to the Lord, Whose 
bountiful hand
Again doth accord His gifts 
to the land.
His clouds have shed down 
their plenteousness here,
His goodness shall crown the 
hopes of the year.

Oh, sing with exultation,
Sing to the Lord, rejoice,
And in His congregation
Shout with triumphant voice.
For, lo, at God's right hand
Is Christ in glory seated;
With death and hell defeated,
As Victor doth command.

O sing ye hallelujah! ’Tis good our God to praise.
 ’Tis pleasant and becoming to Him our songs to raise;
He builds the walls of Zion, He seeks her wandering sons;
He binds their wounds and comforts the brokenhearted ones.

O sinner, lift the eye of 
faith,
To true repentance turning;
Bethink thee of the curse 
of sin,
Its awful guilt discerning;
Upon the Crucified One 
look,
And thou shalt read, as in 
a book,
What well is worthy thy 
learning.

O Sion, open wide thy gates,
Let symbols disappear:
A Priest and Victim, both in one,
The Truth himself is here.
No more the slaughtered beast must die:
Behold, the Father's Son
His temple enters, soon himself
For sinners to atone.
Conscious of hidden Deity,
The lowly Virgin brings
Her new-born Babe, with two young doves,
Her humble offerings.
There waiting Simeon sees at last
The Saviour long desired,
And Anna welcomes Israel's Hope,
With holy rapture fired.
But silent stood the Mother blest
Of the yet silent Word,
And, pondering in her steadfast heart,
With speechless praise adored.
All glory to the Father be,
All glory to the Son,
All glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,
While endless ages run.

O sleepless nights, O 
cheerless days,
O sobs, that will not 
cease;
Be still, be still! kind 
are His ways,
Christ is the Prince of 
Peace:
 ’Tis well thy head, in 
throbbing pain,
May pillow on His breast;
Weep there thy tears like 
springtime rain—
He gives the mourner 
rest.

O sometimes gleams upon our sight,
through present wrong, the eternal right;
and step by step, since time began,
we see the steady gain of man.
That all of good the past hath had
remains to make our own time glad,
our common, daily life divine,
and every land a Palestine.
Through the harsh noises of our day,
a low sweet prelude finds its way;
through clouds of doubt and creeds of fear
a light is breaking, calm and clear.
Henceforth my heart shall sigh no more
for olden time and holier shore:
God's love and blessing, then and there,
are now and here and everywhere.

O Son of God, in glory 
crowned,
The Judge ordained of 
quick and dead!
O Son of man, so 
pitying found
For all the tears Thy 
people shed!

O Son of God, our 
Captain of salvation,
Thyself by suffering 
schooled to human 
grief,
We bless Thee for Thy 
sons of consolation,
Who follow in the 
steps of Thee their 
Chief.

O Son of God, we 
wait for Thee,
In love for Thine 
appearing;
We know Thou 
sittest on the 
throne,
And we Thy Name are 
bearing,
Who trusts in Thee, 
may joyful be,
And see Thee, Lord, 
descending,
To bring us bliss 
unending.

O Son of Man! Thy 
Name by choice,
Our hope, our 
joy, our life,
Make us like 
Thee, Whose 
gentle voice
Was never heard 
in strife.

O Son of Man, 
our Hero strong 
and tender,
Whose servants 
are the brave 
in all the 
earth,
Our living 
sacrifice to 
Thee we render,
Who sharest all 
our sorrows, 
all our mirth.

O Son of Man, 
Thou madest 
known,
Through quiet 
work in shop 
and home,
The 
sacredness of 
common 
things,
The chance of 
life that 
each day 
brings.

O songs of the beautiful, songs of the blest,
That breathe o’er the spirit the calmness of rest;
We list to their music, we echo the praise
Of Christ, our Redeemer, the Ancient of Days.

O sons and 
daughters, 
let us 
sing!
The King of 
heaven, the 
glorious 
King,
Over death 
today rose 
triumphing.
Alleluia! 
Alleluia!

O Source 
divine, 
and life 
of all,
The Fount 
of 
being’s 
wondrous 
sea!
Thy depth 
would 
every 
heart 
appall
That saw 
not love 
supreme 
in Thee.

O Spirit 
of Life, 
O Spirit 
of God,
In every 
need Thou 
bringest 
aid,
Thou 
camest 
forth 
from 
God’s 
great 
throne,
From God, 
the 
Father 
and the 
Son;
O Spirit 
of Life, 
O Spirit 
of God.

O 
Spirit 
of 
the 
living 
God,
In 
all 
Thy 
plenitude 
of 
grace,
Where’er 
the 
foot 
of 
man 
hath 
trod,
Descend 
on 
our 
apostate 
race.

O 
Spirit 
of the 
living 
God, 
Thou 
light 
and 
fire 
divine,
Descend 
upon 
Thy 
church 
once 
more, 
and 
make it 
truly 
Thine.
Fill it 
with 
love 
and joy 
and 
power, 
with 
righteousness 
and 
peace;
Till 
Christ 
shall 
dwell 
in 
human 
hearts, 
and sin 
and 
sorrow 
cease.

O 
splendor 
of 
God’s 
glory 
bright,
From 
light 
eternal 
bringing 
light,
Thou 
Light 
of 
light, 
light’s 
living 
Spring,
True 
Day, 
all 
days 
illumining.

O still in accents sweet and strong
Sounds forth the ancient word,
“More reapers for white harvest fields,
More laborers for the Lord."

O teach me what it meaneth,
That cross uplifted high,
With One, the Man of Sorrows,
Condemned to bleed and die!
O teach me what it cost thee
To make a sinner whole;
And teach me, Saviour, teach me
The value of a soul!
O teach me what it meaneth,
That sacred crimson tide,
The blood and water flowing
From Thine own wounded side.
Teach me that if none other
Had sinned, but I alone,
Yet still Thy blood, Lord Jesus,
Thine only, must atone.
O teach me what it meaneth,
Thy love beyond compare,
The love that reacheth deeper
Than depths of self despair!
Yes, teach me, till there gloweth
In this cold heart of mine
Some feeble, pale reflection
Of that pure love of thine.
O teach me what it meaneth,
For I am full of sin;
And grace alone can reach me,
And love alone can win.
O teach me, for I need Thee,
I have no hope beside,
The chief of all the sinners
For whom the Saviour died!
O Infinite Redeemer!
I bring no other plea,
Because Thou dost invite me
I cast myself on Thee.
Because Thou dost accept me
I love and I adore;
Because Thou love constraineth,
I'll praise Thee evermore!

O tell me no more of this world’s vain store,
The time for such trifles with me now is o’er;
A country I’ve found where true joys abound,
To dwell I’m determined on that happy ground.

O that I could for ever dwell,
Delighted, at the Savior’s feet,
Behold the form I love so well,
And all His tender words repeat.

O that I could repent!
O that I could believe!
Thou by Thy voice the marble rent,
Thou by Thy voice the marble rent,
The rock in sunder cleave!

O that I could, in every place,
By faith behold Jehovah’s face;
My strict Observer see
Present, my heart and reins to try
And feel the influence of His eye
For ever fixed on me!

O that I had a thousand voices
And with a thousand tongues could tell
Of Him in Whom the earth rejoices
Who all things wisely does and well!
My grateful heart would then be free
To tell what God has done for me.

O that I knew the secret place
Where I might find my God!
I’d spread my wants before His face,
And pour my woes abroad.

O that Pearl of great price! have you found it?
Is the Savior supreme in your love?
O consider it well, ere you answer,
As you hope for a welcome above.
Have you given up all for this Treasure?
Have you counted past gains as but loss?
Has your trust in yourself and your merits
Come to naught before Christ and His cross?

O that mine eyes might closed be
To what concerns me not to see;
That deafness might possess mine ear
From what concerns me not to hear;
That truth my tongue might closely tie
From ever speaking foolishly;
That no vain thought might ever rest
Or be conceived in my breast!
Wash, Lord, and purify my heart,
And make it clean in every part;
And when 'tis clean, Lord, keep it too;
For that is more than I can do.


O that the Lord would guide my ways
To keep His statutes still!
O that my God would grant me grace
To know and do His will!

O that the Lord’s salvation
Were out of Zion come,
To heal His ancient nation,
To lead His outcasts home!

O that the race of men would raise
Their voices to their heav’nly King,
And with the sacrifice of praise
The glories of Jehovah sing!
Ye navigators of the sea,
Your course on ocean’s tides who keep,
And there Jehovah’s wonders see,
His wonders in the briny deep!

When all my labors and trials are o’er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

O the bitter shame and sorrow,
That a time could ever be,
When I let the Savior’s pity
Plead in vain, and proudly answered,
“All of self, and none of Thee!"

Weary gleaner in the field, poor or plenty be the yield,
Labor on for the Master, nothing fearing,
There’s a promise of reward, at the coming of the Lord,
Unto all them that love His appearing.

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, vast, unmeasured, boundless, free!
Rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me!
Underneath me, all around me, is the current of Thy love
Leading onward, leading homeward to Thy glorious rest above!

O the depth of love divine, th’unfathomable grace!
Who shall say how bread and wine God into us conveys!
How the bread His flesh imparts, how the wine transmits His blood,
Fills His faithful people’s hearts with all the life of God!

O the way is long and weary,
And our bleeding feet are sore;
Is it far to Canaan’s land?
Is it far to Canaan’s land?
In the desert we are longing
For its shelter more and more
Is it far, is it far to Canaan’s land?

O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
O they tell me of a home far away
And they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an unclouded day

O thou, who at thy Eucharist didst pray
that all thy Church might be for ever one,
grant us at every Eucharist to say
with longing heart and soul, "thy will be done."
O may we all one Bread, one Body be,
through this blest Sacrament of unity.
For all thy Church, O Lord, we intercede;
make thou our sad divisions soon to cease;
draw us the nearer each to each, we plead,
by drawing all to thee, O Prince of Peace;
thus may we all one Bread, one Body be,
through this blest Sacrament of unity.
We pray thee too for wanderers from thy fold;
O bring them back, good Shepherd of the sheep,
back to the faith which saints believed of old,
back to the Church which still that faith doth keep;
soon may we all one Bread, one Body be,
through this blest Sacrament of unity.
So, Lord, at length when sacraments shall cease,
may we be one with all thy Church above,
one with thy saints in one unbroken peace,
one with thy saints in one unbounded love;
more blessed still, in peace and love to be
one with the Trinity in Unity.

O Thou before Whose presence naught evil may come in,
Yet Who dost look in mercy down on this world of sin,
O give us noble purpose to set the sin bound free,
And Christlike tender pity to seek the lost for Thee.

O Thou eternal Christ of God, ride on, ride on, ride on!
Establish Thou forevermore the triumph now begun.
A mighty host, by Thee redeemed, is marching in Thy train,
Thine is the kingdom and the power, and Thou in love shalt reign.

O thou eternal King most high,
Whose Blood has brought salvation nigh,
The bonds of death are burst by thee,
And love has won the victory.
Ascending to the Father's throne
Thou tak'st the kingdom as thine own;
While awestruck angels contemplate
The wondrous change of man's estate.
Be thou our joy, O mighty Lord,
As thou wilt be our great reward;
Let all our glory be in thee
Both now and through eternity.

O Thou God of my salvation, my Redeemer from all sin;
Moved by Thy divine compassion, Who hast died my heart to win;
I will praise Thee, I will praise Thee, where shall I Thy praise begin?
I will praise Thee, I will praise Thee, where shall I Thy praise begin?

O Thou great Shepherd of Thy chosen race,
Who leadest like a flock Thine Israel dear,
From out the cherubim reveal Thy face,
Before our host now let Thy might appear.
Come Thou, O God, to save us and restore;
We shall be saved when shines Thy face once more.

O Thou In Whose Presence My Soul Takes Delight
On whom in affliction I call;
My comfort by day, and my song in the night,
My hope, my salvation, my all.
Where dost thou at noontide resort with thy sheep,
To feed on the pastures of love?
Say, why in the valley of death should I weep,
Or alone in the wilderness rove?
O why should I wander an alien from thee,
Or cry in the desert for bread?
Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,
And smile at the tears I have shed.
Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have ye seen
The Star that on Israel shone?
Say, if in your tents my Beloved has been,
And where with His flock He has gone?
This is my Beloved, His form is divine
His vestments shed odors around;
The locks on His head are as grapes on the vine,
When autumn with plenty is crowned,
As roses of Sharon, as lilies that grow
In vales, on the banks of the streams,
On his cheeks does the beauty of excellence glow,
And His eyes are as quivers of beams.
His voice as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
Is heard through the shadows of death;
The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet,
The air is perfumed with His breath.
His lips as a fountain of righteousness flow,
That waters the garden of grace,
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
And bask in the smiles of His face.
Love is in His eye-lids, and scatters delight
Through all the bright mansions on high;
Their faces the cherubim veil in His sight,
And praise Him with fullness of joy.
1He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice
And myriads wait for his word;
He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

O thou joyful, O thou wonderful
Grace revealing Christmastide!
Jesus came to win us
From all sin within us;
Glorify, glorify the Holy Child!

O thou my soul, bless God the Lord;
And all that in me is
Be stirred up His holy Name
To magnify and bless.

O thou my soul, bless God the Lord;
And all that in me is
Be stirred up His holy Name
To magnify and bless.

O thou, my soul, forget no more
The Friend Who all thy misery bore;
Let every idol be forgot,
But, O my soul, forget Him not.

O thou not made with hands,
not throned above the skies,
nor walled with shining walls,
nor framed with stones of price,
more bright than gold or gem,
God's own Jerusalem!
Where'er the gentle heart
finds courage from above;
where'er the heart forsook
warms with the breath of love;
where faith bids fear depart,
City of God, thou art.
Thou art where'er the proud
in humbleness melts down;
where self itself yields up;
where martyrs win their crown;
where faithful souls possess
themselves in perfect peace;
where in life's common ways
with cheerful feet we go;
where in his steps we tread,
who trod the way of woe;
where he is in the heart,
City of God, thou art.
Not throned above the skies,
nor golden-walled afar,
but where Christ's two or three
in his name gathered are,
be in the midst of them,
God's own Jerusalem.

O Thou that hear’st when sinners cry,
Though all my crimes before Thee lie,
Behold them not with angry look,
But blot their mem’ry from Thy book.

O Jesu, thou the Virgin's crown,
Thy gracious ear to us bow down,
Born of that Virgin whom alone
The Mother and the Maid we own.
In thee, their Bridegroom and their Lord,
The virgins find their bright reward,
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps wend
With hymns and praises thee attend.
O gracious Lord, we thee implore
Thy grace into our minds to pour;
From all defilement keep us free,
And make us pure in heart for thee.
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to thee,
Whom with the Spirit we adore,
For ever and for evermore.

O Thou to Whose all searching sight
The darkness shineth as the light,
Search, prove my heart; it pants 
for Thee;
O burst these bonds, and set it 
free!

O Thou Who by a star didst 
guide
The wise men on their way,
Until it came and stood beside
The place where Jesus lay.

O Thou who at Thy creature’s bar
Thy glorious Godhead didst 
declare,
A true and good confession make;
Come in Thy Spirit from above
And arm me with Thy faithful 
love,
For Thy own truth and mercy’s 
sake.
Called forth by Thee Thou know’st 
I am,
Thy truth and mercy to proclaim,
Thy Godhead, and eternal power,
The man whom God His fellow owns,
Whom angel-powers, dominions, 
thrones
Through all eternity adore.

O Thou Who by a star didst 
guide
The wise men on their way,
Until it came and stood beside
The place where Jesus lay.

O Thou Who camest from above,
The pure celestial fire to 
impart,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
Upon the mean altar of my 
heart.

O Thou, Who didst with love 
untold
Thy doubting servant chide,
Bidding the eye of sense 
behold
Thy wounded hands and side.

O thou who dost accord us
the highest prize and guerdon,
thou hope of all our race,
Jesus, do thou afford us
the gift we ask of pardon
for all who humbly seek thy face.
With whispered accusation
our conscience tells of sinning
in thought and word and deed;
thine is our restoration,
the work of grace beginning
for souls from every burden freed.
For who, if thou reject us,
shall raise the fainting spirit?
 'Tis thine alone to spare:
if thou to life elect us,
with cleansed hearts to near it,
shall be our task, our lowly prayer.
O Trinity most glorious,
thy pardon free bestowing,
defend us evermore;
that in thy courts victorious,
thy love more truly knowing,
we may with all thy saints adore.

O Thou Who dost to man 
accord
His highest prize, his 
best reward,
Thou Hope of all our 
race;
Jesu, to Thee we now draw 
near,
Our earnest supplications 
hear,
Who humbly seek Thy face.

O Thou Who dwell’st on 
high,
’Mid burning seraphs 
bright,
Pavilioned in the azure 
sky,
Robed with celestial 
light:
Permit us to draw near,
And worship and adore;
Redeemed from sin and 
guilt and fear,
Thy blessing we 
implore.

O thou who gavest power to love
That we might fix our hearts on thee,
Preparing us for joys above
By that which here on earth we see;
Thy Spirit trains our souls to know
The growing purpose of thy will,
And gives to love the power to show
That purpose growing larger still.
Larger, as love to reverent eyes
Makes manifest another soul,
And shows to life a richer prize,
A clearer course, a nobler goal.
Lord, grant thy servants who implore
Thy blessing on the hearts they blend,
That from that union evermore
New joys may blossom to the end.
Make what is best in each combine
To purge all earthly dross away,
To strengthen, purify, refine,
To beautify each coming day.
So may they hand in hand advance
Along life's paths from troubles free;
Brave to meet adverse circumstance
Because their love points up to thee.

O Thou, who gav’st 
Thy servant grace
On Thee the living 
Rock to rest,
To look on Thine 
unveiled face,
And lean on Thy 
protecting breast.

O Thou, Who hast at 
Thy command
The hearts of all 
men in Thy hand,
Our wayward, erring 
hearts incline
To have no other 
will but Thine.

O Thou Who hast 
Thy servants 
taught
That not by words 
alone,
But by the fruits 
of holiness,
The life of God 
is shown.

O Thou Who in 
Jordan didst 
bow Thy meek 
head,
And, ’whelmed 
in our sorrow, 
didst sink to 
the dead,
Then rose from 
the darkness to 
glory above,
And claimed for 
Thy chosen the 
kingdom of 
love.

O Thou Who 
makest souls to 
shine
With light from 
brighter worlds 
above,
Now send Thy 
glistening dew 
divine
On all who seek 
a Savior’s 
love!

O Thou Who sealest up the past,
The days slip from us, and the years
Grow silent with their hopes and fears;
 ’Tis Thine to keep all things at last.

O Thou Who 
the Shepherd 
of Israel 
art,
Give ear to 
our pray’r 
and Thy favor 
impart;
Thou Leader 
of Joseph, 
Thou Guide of 
his way,
 ’Mid cherubim 
dwelling, Thy 
glory 
display.

O Thou who this mysterious bread
Didst in Emmaus break,
Return, herewith our souls to feed,
And to thy followers speak.
Unseal the volume of thy grace,
Apply the gospel word,
Open our eyes to see thy face,
Our hearts to know the Lord.
Of thee communing still, we mourn
Till thou the veil remove;
Talk with us, and our hearts shall burn
With flames of fervent love.
Enkindle now the heavenly zeal,
And make thy mercy known,
And give our pardoned souls to feel
That God and love are one.

O Thou, Who 
through 
this holy 
week,
Didst 
suffer for 
us all,
The sick to 
heal, the 
lost to 
seek,
To raise up 
them that 
fall.

O Thou, Who 
through 
this holy 
week,
Didst 
suffer for 
us all,
The sick to 
heal, the 
lost to 
seek,
To raise up 
them that 
fall.

O Thou, 
Whom 
all Thy 
saints 
adore,
We now 
with 
all Thy 
saints 
agree,
And bow 
our 
inmost 
souls 
before
Thy 
glorious, 
awful 
majesty.

O thou, whom once they flocked to hear,
Thy words to hear, thy power to feel;
Suffer the sinners to draw near,
And graciously receive us still.
They that be whole, thyself hast said,
No need of a physician have;
But I am sick, and want thine aid,
And want thine utmost power to save.
Thy power, and truth, and love divine,
The same from age to age endure;
A word, a gracious word of thine,
The most inveterate plague can cure.
Helpless howe'er my spirit lies,
And long hath languished at the pool,
A word of thine shall make me rise,
And speak me in a moment whole.
Make this my Lord's accepted hour;
Come, O my souls physician, thou!
Display thy justifying power,
And show me thy salvation now.

O 
Thou 
Whose 
all 
redeeming 
might
Crowns 
every 
chief 
in 
faith’s 
true 
fight,
On 
this 
commemoration 
day
Hear 
us, 
good 
Jesu, 
while 
we 
pray.

O 
Thou 
Whose 
feet 
have 
climbed 
life’s 
hill
And 
trod 
the 
path 
of 
youth,
Our 
Savior 
and 
our 
Brother 
still,
Now 
lead 
us 
into 
truth.

O 
Thou 
Whose 
gracious 
presence 
blest
The 
home 
at 
Bethany,
This 
shelter 
from 
the 
world’s 
unrest,
This 
home 
made 
ready 
for 
its 
Guest,
We 
dedicate 
to 
Thee.

O 
Thou 
Whose 
hand 
hath 
brought 
us
Unto 
this 
joyful 
day,
Accept 
our 
glad 
thanksgiving,
And 
listen 
as 
we 
pray;
And 
may 
our 
preparation
For 
this 
day’s 
service 
be
With 
one 
accord 
to 
offer
Ourselves, 
O 
Lord, 
to 
Thee.

O Thou whose justice reigns on high,
And makes th’oppressor cease,
Behold how envious sinners try
To vex and break my peace.

O Thou whose offering on the tree
The legal offerings all foreshowed,
Borrowed their whole effect from Thee,
And drew their virtue from Thy blood.

O Thou, before the world began,
Ordained a sacrifice for man,
And by th’eternal Spirit made
An Offering for the sinner’s stead;
Our everlasting Priest art Thou,
Pleading Thy death for sinners now.

O Thou, from Whom all goodness flows,
I lift my heart to Thee;
In all my sorrows, conflicts, woes,
Dear Lord, remember me.

O Thou, in all Thy might so far,
In all Thy love so near,
Beyond the range of sun and star,
And yet beside us here.

O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
On whom in affliction I call,
My comfort by day, and my song in the night,
My hope, my salvation, my all.

O Thou, our Savior, Brother, Friend,
Behold a cloud of incense rise;
The prayers of saints to Heaven ascend,
Grateful, accepted sacrifice.

O Thou, the contrite sinner’s Friend,
Who loving, lov’st them to the end,
On this alone my hopes depend,
That Thou wilt plead for me.

O Thou, the eternal Son of God,
The Lamb, for sinners slain,
We worship, while Thy head is bowed
In agony and pain.

O Thou, to Whom, in ancient time,
The lyre of Hebrews bards was strung,
Whom kings adored in song sublime,
And prophets praised with glowing 
tongue.

O Thou before Whose presence naught evil may come in,
Yet Who dost look in mercy down on this world of sin,
O give us noble purpose to set the sin bound free,
And Christlike tender pity to seek the lost for Thee.

O Thou Who camest from above,
The pure celestial fire to 
impart,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
Upon the mean altar of my 
heart.

O throned, O crowned with all renown,
Since Thou the earth hast trod,
Thou reignest, and by Thee come down
Henceforth the gifts of God.
By Thee the suns of space, that burn
Unspent, their watches hold;
The hosts that turn, and still return
Are swayed, and poised, and rolled.

O to abide in Jesus,
O to be His alone;
Close to the fount of blessing,
Close to my Savior’s throne.
O for an earnest longing,
Into His life to grow;
O for a deeper yearning,
More of its joy to know.

O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer,
This is my constant longing and prayer;
Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures,
Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.

v

O Trinity, most blessed light,
O Unity of sovereign might,
as now the fiery sun departs,
shed thou thy beams within our hearts.
To thee our morning song of praise,
to thee our evening prayer we raise;
thee may our souls for evermore
in lowly reverence adore.
All praise to God the Father be,
all praise, eternal Son, to thee,
whom with the Spirit we adore,
for ever and for evermore.Amen.

O troubled sea of Galilee,
When run thy billows high,
And through thy dreaded storms I see
That pain and death are nigh;
O when thy threatening clouds appear
And floods impending chill,
Through surge and tempest may I hear
A voice say, “Peace, be still."

O ’twas a joyful sound to hear
Our tribes devoutly say,
Up, Israel! to the temple haste,
And keep your festal day.
At Salem’s courts we must appear,
With our assembled powers,
In strong and beauteous order ranged,
Like her united towers.

O Unity of threefold light,
Send out Thy loveliest ray,
Add scatter our transgressions’ night,
And turn it into day;
Make us those temples pure and fair
Thy glory loveth well,
The spotless tabernacles, where
Thou may’st vouchsafe to dwell.

O valiant hearts who to your glory came
Through dust of conflict and through battle flame;
Tranquil you lie, your knightly virtue proved,
Your memory hallowed in the land you loved.

O very God of very God,
And very Light of Light,
Whose feet this earth’s dark valley trod,
That so it might be bright.

O voice of the Beloved!
Thy bride hath heard Thee say,
 “Rise up, My love, My fair one,
Arise and come away.
For lo, ’tis past, the winter,
The winter of thy year;
The rain is past and over,
The flowers on earth appear.

O what shall I do my Savior to praise,
So faithful and true, so plenteous in grace,
So strong to deliver, So good to redeem
The weakest believer that hangs upon Him!

O what their joy and their glory must be,
Those endless Sabbaths the blessed ones see;
Crown for the valiant, to weary ones, rest;
God shall be all, and in all ever blessed.

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above,
And from that flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love!
When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin,
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above,
And from that flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love!
When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin,
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?

O when the saints go marching in,
O when the saints go marching in;
O Lord, I want to be among the number
When the saints go marching in!
O when they crown Him Lord of all,
O when they crown Him Lord of all;
O Lord, I want to be among the number
When they crown Him Lord of all.
O when all knees bow at His name,
O when all knees bow at His name,
O Lord, I want to be among the number
When all knees bow at His name.
O when they sing the Saviour's praise,
O when they sing the Saviour's praise,
O Lord, I want to be among the number
When they sing the Saviour's praise.
O when the saints go marching in,
O when the saints go marching in;
O Lord, I want to be among the number
When the saints go marching in!

O where are kings and empires now
Of old, that went and came?
But Lord, Thy Church is praying yet,
A thousand years the same.

O where are the reapers that garner in
The sheaves of the good from the fields of sin?
With sickles of truth must the work be done,
And no one may rest till the “harvest home."

O where shall rest be found,
Rest for the weary soul?
 ’Twere vain the ocean’s depths to sound,
Or pierce to either pole.

O wherefore do the nations rage,
And kings and rulers strive in vain,
Against the Lord of earth and Heav’n
To overthrow Messiah’s reign?

O wherefore hast Thou cast us off,
O God, our God of old?
Why art Thou angry with Thy sheep,
The sheep of Thine own fold,
The sheep of Thine own fold?

O who like Thee, so calm, so bright,
Thou Son of Man, Thou Light of Light?
O who like Thee did ever go
So patient through a world of woe!

Oh, do not let thy Lord depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not thy heart;
Thou wouldst be saved—why not tonight?
Thou wouldst be saved—why not tonight?

O do not let the Word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved, O tonight.

O why so far removed, O Lord,
And why so distant be;
Why hidest Thou Thy face from us
In our anxiety?

O Will of God beneath our life,
The sea beneath the wave:
From Thee we rise in mystic strife,
In Thee we find our grave.

I have heard a most wonderful story
Of Jesus, the Savior and King;
How He came from the bright realms of glory
Glad news of salvation to bring.

O wondrous sight! O vision fair
[

O wondrous type, O vision fair
Of glory that the Church shall share,
Which Christ upon the mountain shows,
Where brighter than the sun he glows!
The law and prophets there have place,
The chosen witnesses of grace;
The Father's voice from out the cloud
Proclaims his only Son aloud.
With shining face and bright array,
Christ deigns to manifest to-day
What glory shall to faith be given
When we enjoy our God in heaven.
And Christian hearts are raised on high
By that great vision's mystery,
For which in thankful strains we raise
On this glad day the voice of praise.

O Word immortal of eternal God,
only-begotten of the only Source,
for our salvation stooping to the course
of human life and born of Mary's blood;
Sprung from the ever-virgin womanhood
of her who bare thee, God immutable,
incarnate, made as man with man to dwell,
and condescending to the bitter rood;
Save us, O Christ our God, for thou hast died
to save thy people to the uttermost,
and dying tramplest death in victory;
one of the ever-blessed Trinity,
in equal honor with the Holy Ghost,
and with the eternal Father glorified.

O Word immortal of eternal God,
Only begotten of the only Source,
For our salvation stooping to the course
Of human life, and born of Mary’s blood.
In equal honor with the Holy Ghost,
And with th’eternal Father glorified.

O Word of God, how marvelous
Thy wisdom and thy power!
How manifold thy mightiness
To meet our need each hour!

O Word of God above,
Who fillest all in all,
Hallow this house with Thy sure love,
And bless our festival.

O Word of God incarnate, O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging, O Light of our dark sky:
We praise You for the radiance that from the hallowed page,
A Lantern to our footsteps, shines on from age to age.

O word of pity, for our pardon pleading,
Breathed in the hour of loneliness and pain;
O voice, which through the ages interceding,
Calls us to fellowship with God again.

O worship the King, all glorious above,
O gratefully sing His power and His love;
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness!
Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;
With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His Name!

O wretched man, that I am
Who'll deliver me, from this body of death?
O wretched man, that I am
Who'll deliver me, from this body of death?

O ye immortal throng of angels round the throne,
Join with our feeble song, to make the Savior known:
On earth ye knew His wondrous grace;
His glorious face in Heav’n ye view.

O young and fearless Prophet of ancient Galilee,
Thy life is still a summons to serve humanity;
To make our thoughts and actions less prone to please the crowd,
To stand with humble courage for truth with hearts uncowed.

O Zion, tune thy voice,
and raise thy hands on high;
tell all the earth thy joys,
and boast salvation nigh.
Cheerful in God, arise and shine,
while rays divine stream all abroad.
He gilds the morning face 
with beams that cannot fade;
his all-resplendent grace
he pours around thy head;
the nations round thy form shall view,
with luster new divinely crowned.
In honor to his Name
reflect that sacred light;
and loud that grace proclaim,
which makes thy darkness bright;
pursue his praise, till sovereign love
in worlds above the glory raise.
There on his holy hill
a brighter sun shall rise,
and with his radiance
fill those fairer purer skies;
while round his throne ten thousand stars
in nobler spheres his influence own.

O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,
To tell to all the world that God is light,
That He who made all nations is not willing
One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

O Zion, open wide thy gates,
Let figures disappear;
A Priest and Victim, both in One,
The Truth Himself, is here.

O Martyrs young and fresh as flowers,
Your day was in its morning hours
When Christ was sought and you were found
Like rain-strewn petals on the ground.
How weak to hurt you was the king!
You are Christ's morning offering,
His pretty lambs, his children, gay
With martyr-crowns and palms at play.
And you had cheated Herod's rage,
You little boys of Jesus' age;
For he whom Herod sought to slay,
Jesus, untouched escaped away.
Glory, O Christ the Lord to thee,
Child of the blessed Virgin, be,
Whom with the Father we adore
And Holy Spirit evermore.

How can I show Him love, I obey Him
How can I show the One from above my love
Obey Him
How can I show Him love, I obey Him
How can I show the One from above my love
Obey Him (I will obey Him)

Object of all our knowledge here,
Our one Desire, and Hope below,
Jesus, the Crucified, draw near,
And with Thy sad disciples go:
Our thoughts and words to Thee are known,
We commune of Thyself alone.

O’er continent and ocean,
From city, field, and wood,
Still speak, O Lord, Thy messengers
Of peace and brotherhood.
In Athens and Benares,
In Rome and Galilee,
They fronted kings and conquerors,
And taught mankind of Thee.

O'er Jerusalem Thou weepest
In compassion, dearest Lord.
Love divine, of love the deepest,
O'er Thine erring Israel poured,
Crieth out in bitter moan:
 "O loved city, hadst thou known
This thy day of visitation,
Thou wouldst not reject salvation."

O’er the distant mountains breaking
Comes the redd’ning dawn of day;
Rise, my soul, from sleep awaking,
Rise, and sing, and watch, and pray;
’Tis the Savior, blessed Lord,
On His bright returning way.

O’er the trackless ocean guided
By Thy hand our fathers came;
They, O Lord, in Thee confided,
Loved Thy day, revered Thy Name;
Nor would we, their faith despising,
False to their devotion be,
But, on wings of pray’r arising,
Lift our contrite hearts to Thee.

O’er those gloomy hills of darkness,
Look, my soul; be still, and gaze;
All the promises do travail
With a glorious day of grace:
Blessed jubilee!
Let thy glorious morning dawn.

O’erwhelmed in depths of woe,
Upon the tree of scorn,
Hangs the Redeemer of mankind,
With racking anguish torn.

Of all in earth or Heaven,
The dearest name to me,
Is the matchless Name of Jesus,
The Christ of Calvary.

Of all the thoughts of God that are
Borne inward into souls afar,
Along the psalmist’s music deep,
Now tell me if there any is,
For gift or grace surpassing this:
“He giveth His beloved sleep"?

Of Him Who did salvation bring,
I could forever think and sing:
Arise, ye needy, He’ll relieve;
Arise, ye guilty, He’ll forgive.

Of mercy and of justice
My thankful song shall be;
O Lord, in joyful praises
My song shall rise to Thee.
Within my house I purpose
To walk in wisdom’s way;
O Lord, I need Thy presence;
How long wilt Thou delay?

Of the Father’s love begotten, ere 
the worlds began to be,
He is Alpha and Omega, He the source, 
the ending He,
Of the things that are, that have 
been,
And that future years shall see, 
evermore and evermore!

Of the Father's love begotten
ere the worlds began to be,
he is Alpha and Omega,
he the source, the ending he,
of the things that are, that have been,
and that future years shall see,
evermore and evermore.
O that birth for ever blessed,
when the Virgin, full of grace,
by the Holy Ghost conceiving,
bare the Saviour of our race,
and the babe, the world's Redeemer,
first revealed his sacred face,
evermore and evermore.
O ye heights of heaven, adore him;
angel hosts, his praises sing;
powers, dominions bow before him,
and extol our God and King;
let no tongue on earth be silent,
every voice in concert ring,
evermore and evermore.

Of the glorious body telling,
O my tongue, its mysteries sing.
And the blood, all price excelling,
Which the world’s eternal King,
In a noble womb once dwelling,
Shed for this world’s ransoming.

Oft in danger, oft in woe,
onward, Christian, onward go:
bear the toil, maintain the strife,
strengthened with the Bread of Life.
Onward Christians, onward go,
join the war and face the foe;
will ye flee in danger's hour?
Know ye not your Captain's power?
Let your drooping hearts be glad:
march in heavenly armor clad:
fight, nor think the battle long,
victory soon shall be your song.
Let not sorrow dim your eye,
soon shall every tear be dry;
let not fears your course impede,
great your strength, if great your need.
Onward then in battle move,
more than conquerors ye shall prove;
though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go.

Oft in sorrow, oft in woe,
Onward, Christian, onward go:
Fight the fight, maintain the strife
Strengthened with the Bread of life.

When the Bridegroom cometh by and by,
When the Bridegroom cometh by and by,
Will your lamps be burning bright,
Will your robes be pure and white,
When the Bridegroom cometh by and by?

Oh, bless the Lord, my soul!
Let all within me join
And aid my tongue to bless His name
Whose favors are divine.

Oh, blest the house, whate'er befall,
Where Jesus Christ is all in all!
Yea, if He were not dwelling there,
How dark and poor and void it were!

Oh how fair that morning broke,
When in Eden man awoke!
Beast and bird and insect bright
Reveled in the gladsome light;
God looked down from Heav’n above,
All was life and joy and love.

Oh, how great is Thy compassion,
Faithful Father, God of grace,
That with all our fallen race
And in our deep degradation
Thou wast merciful that we
Might be saved eternally!

Oh, how great is Thy compassion,
Faithful Father, God of grace,
That with all our fallen race
And in our deep degradation
Thou wast merciful that we
Might be saved eternally!

There is a Name that I love to hear
And I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in my ear
The sweetest Name on earth

Oh, how sweet when we mingle with kindred spirits here,
And tell of Jesus and His love!
When by faith we can see Him, and feel His presence near,
And lift our longing souls above.

I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified—
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled, and died.

Oh Lead Me,      to the place where I can find    you

Oh Lord, You're beautiful,
Your face is all I seek.
For when Your eyes are on this child,
Your grace abounds to me.

Oh perfect love, all human thought transcending
Lowly we kneel in prayer before thy throne (holy throne)
That theirs may be the love which knows no ending
Whom thou forever more doth join in one

Oh realm of light! whose morning star
To Bethlehem’s manger led the way,
Not yet upon our longing eyes
Shines the full splendor of thy day:
Yet still across the centuries fall,
Both strong and sweet, our Lord’s command;
And still with steadfast faith we cry,
“Behold, the kingdom is at hand!"

Oh, that the Lord would guide my ways
To keep His statutes still!
Oh, that my God would grant me grace
To know and do His will!

Oh! the priceless love of Jesus!
Oh, the strength of grace divine,
All His gifts are showered upon me,
All His blessings may be mine;
He is throned in heav'nly glory.
Where no sin nor death can be,
Yet He loves me in this darkness,
Yet He dooes not turn from me.

Oh to be over yonder,
In that bright land of wonder,
Where the angel voices mingle, and
The angel harps do ring!
To be free from care and sorrow,
And the anxious dread tomorrow,
To rest in light and sunshine in
The presence of the King!

Oh, to be robed and ready
Ready when the Lord shall come
Oh to be waiting, watching,
Watching for the summons home.

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?
Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,
He passeth from life to rest in the grave.

Oh, bliss of the purified, bliss of the free,
I plunge in the crimson tide opened for me;
O’er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand,
And point to the print of the nails in His hand.

Oh! come to the merciful Savior Who calls you,
Oh! come to the Lord Who forgives and forgets;
Though dark be the fortune on earth that befalls you,
There’s a bright home above, where the sun never sets.

Oh, enter, Lord, Thy temple,
Be Thou my spirit’s Guest,
Who gavest me, the earth-born,
A second birth more blest.
Thou in the Godhead, Lord,
Though here to dwell Thou deignest,
Forever equal reignest,
Art equally adored.

Oh, how blest are ye whose toils are ended!
Who, through death, have unto God ascended!
Ye have arisen
From the cares which keep us still in prison.

Oh, it is hard to work for God,
To rise and take His part
Upon this battlefield of earth,
And not sometimes lose heart!

I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified—
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled, and died.

Oh, rejoice, ye Christians, loudly,
For our joy hath now begun;
Wondrous things our God hath done.
Tell abroad His goodness proudly
Who our race hath honored thus
That He deigns to dwell with us.

Heav’nly Father, we Thy children,
Gathered round our risen Lord,
Lift our hearts in earnest pleading:
Oh, revive us by Thy Word!

Oh, sing with exultation,
Sing to the Lord, rejoice,
And in His congregation
Shout with triumphant voice.
For, lo, at God’s right hand
Is Christ in glory seated;
With death and hell defeated,
As Victor doth command.

The Lord said: 'Noah, there's going to be a flood,
There's going to be some water, there's going to be some mud,
So, take off your hat, Noah, take of your coat,
Get Shem, Ham, and Japeth and build yourself a boat.'
Noah said: 'Lord, I don't believe I could.'
The Lord said: 'Noah, get yourself some wood.
You never know what you can do till you try.
Build it fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.'
Noah said: 'There she is, there she is, Lord!'
The Lord said: 'Noah, it's time to get aboard.
Take of each creature a he and a she,
And of course take Mrs Noah and the whole family.'
Noah said: 'Lord, it's getting mighty dark.'
The Lord said: 'Noah, get those creatures in the ark.'
Noah said: 'Lord, it's beginning to pour.'
The Lord said: 'Noah, hurry up and close the door.'
The ark rose up on the bosom of the deep.
After forty days Mr Noah took a peep.
He said: 'We're not moving, Lord, where are we at?'
The Lord said: 'You're sitting right on Mount Ararat.'
Noah said: 'Lord, it's getting nice and dry.'
The Lord said: 'Noah, see my rainbow in the sky.
Take all your creatures and people the earth,
And be sure that you're not more trouble than you're worth.'

Oh, to be nearer, nearer,
The feet of my Lord and King!
Oh, to enjoy His presence,
And only His love to sing!

Oh, to be nothing, nothing,
Only to lie at His feet,
A broken and emptied vessel,
For the Master’s use made meet.
Emptied that He might fill me
As forth to His service I go;
Broken, that so unhindered,
His life through me might show.

Oh, what are you going to do, brother?
Say, what are you going to do?
You have thought of some useful labor,
But what is the end in view?
You are fresh from the home of your boyhood,
And just in the bloom of youth!
Have you tasted the sparkling water,
That flows from the fount of truth?
Is your heart in the Savior’s keeping?
Remember, He died for you!
Then what are you going to do, brother?
Say, what are you going to do?

Oh! what, if we are Christ’s,
Is earthly shame or loss?
Bright shall the crown of glory be
When we have borne the cross.

I have a Redeemer, O worship His Name,
He bore my transgressions, my sin and my shame,
And in His own body on Calvary’s tree,
He took them upon Him that I might go free.

Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
True wisdom its pages unfold;
And though we may read them a thousand times o’er,
They never, no never, grow old!
Each line hath a treasure, each promise a pearl,
That all if they will may secure;
And we know that when time and the world pass away,
God’s Word shall forever endure.

There was a time on earth, when in the book of Heav’n
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiv’n;
My name was at the top, and many things below,
I went unto the Keeper, and settled long ago.

’Mid the storms of doubt and unbelief, we fear,
Stands a Book eternal that the saints hold dear;
Thro’ the restless ages it remains the same—
 ’Tis the Book of God, and the Bible is its name!

From the Word of God light is shining brightly out
O’er life’s ocean, tempest driv’n,
Guiding past the rocks and the hidden shoals of doubt
To the blissful port of Heav’n.

Oh I’d like to go back to that old country church
And to hear the songs of priase
How the people would sing, it would make the heavens ring
At that old (at that old) country church

I'm gonna take a trip
In the good old gospel ship,
Christ the Lord has paid my fare;
I'll hear the trumpet sound
And I'll leave this sinful ground,
I'll go sailing through the air.

Are you living in an old man's rubble
Are you listening to the father of lies?
If you are then you're headed for trouble
If you listen too long you'll eventually die

Is your hope of glory bright?
Are you walking in the light,
Ever shining from the Savior’s throne?
Have you gone to Him for rest,
When your heart was sore oppressed?
Are you trusting in His arm alone?

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

I was drifting away on life’s pitiless sea,
And the angry waves threatened my ruin to be,
When away at my side, there I dimly descried,
A stately old vessel, and loudly I cried:
 “Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!"
And loudly I cried: “Ship ahoy!"

Jesus He will fix it
Jesus He will fix it
Jesus He will fix it

We are gathered for Thy blessing,
We will wait upon our God;
We will trust in Him Who loved us,
And Who bought us with His blood.

Do you love the blessed Savior
In the old time way?
Is your heart aglow with rapture
In the old time way?

The old year now hath passed away;
We thank Thee, O our God, today
That Thou hast kept us through the year
When danger and distress were near.

Omnipotent Lord, my Savior and King,
Thy succor afford, Thy righteousness bring;
Thy promises bind Thee compassion to have,
Now, now let me find Thee almighty to save.

Omnipotent Redeemer,
Our ransomed souls adore thee,
Whate'er is done
Thy work we own,
And give thee all the glory;
With thankfulness acknowledge
Our time of visitation;
Thine hand confess,
And gladly bless
The God of our salvation.
Thou hast employed thy servants,
And blessed their weak endeavours,
And lo! in thee
We myriads see
Of practical believers;
The church of pardoned sinners,
Exulting in their Saviour,
Sing all day long
The gospel song,
And triumph in thy favour.
Thy wonders wrought already
Require our ceaseless praises
But show thy power,
And myriads more
Endue with heavenly graces.
But fill our earth with glory,
And, known by every nation,
God of all grace
Receive the praise
Of all thy new creation.

What is the song the angels sing?
Sweetly sing, gladly sing;
What is the song the angels sing,
On a Christmas morning?
O, “Peace on earth," the angels sing,
Sweetly sing, gladly sing,
O, “Peace on earth," the angels sing,
On a Christmas morning.

On a day when men were counted, God became the Son of Man,
That His Name in every census should be entered was His plan.
God, the Lord of all creation, humbly takes a creature’s place;
He Whose form no man has witnessed has today a human face.

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
the emblem of suffering and shame;
and I love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.

On all the earth Thy Spirit shower;
The earth in righteousness renew;
Thy kingdom come, and hell’s o’erpower,
And to Thy scepter all subdue.

On Christmas night all Christians sing,
To hear the news the angels bring;
On Christmas night all Christians sing,
To hear the news the angels bring:
News of great joy, news of great mirth,
News of our merciful King’s birth.

On God alone my soul relies,
And He will soon relieve;
The Lord will hear my plaintive cries
At morning, noon, and eve.

On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry
Announces that the Lord is nigh;
Come, then, and hearken, for he brings
Glad tidings from the King of kings!

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

On Judah’s plains as shepherds sat,
Watching their flocks by night,
The angel of the Lord appeared,
Clad in celestial light.

On let us go where the valley of Eden fair
Blooms on the bank of the river;
On where the fields, in the beautiful robe they wear,
Wave in the sunlight forever.

On man, in his own image made,
How much did God bestow?
The whole creation homage paid,
And owned him lord, below!

My mind tells me one thing but my heart won't say the same
When I follow my mind it almost always leads to pain
My heart is where the truth is and it always leads me
To the one who I adore, the one who'll love me forever more
There's no way (no I'm not on my own) that I can make it (no I'm not on my own)
On my own (no I'm not on my own), on my own (not on my own)

On Olivet a little band
Around their risen Master stand:
And after charge and blessing giv’n,
He passeth from them into Heav’n.

On our way rejoicing, as we homeward move,
Hearken to our praises, O Thou God of love!
Is there grief or sadness? Thou our joy shalt be;
Is our sky beclouded? There is light with Thee.

On the birthday of the Lord
Angels joy in glad accord,
And they sing in sweetest tone,
Glory be to God alone,
Glory be to God alone.

On the cross of Calvary,
Jesus died for you and me;
There He shed His precious blood,
That from sin we might be free.
O the cleansing stream does flow,
And it washes white as snow!
It was for me that Jesus died
On the cross of Calvary.

On the mountain’s top appearing,
Lo! the sacred herald stands,
Welcome news to Zion bearing
Zion, long in hostile lands:
Mourning captive, God Himself shall loose thy bands.
Mourning captive, God Himself shall loose thy bands.

On the resurrection morning,
Soul and body meet again,
No more sorrow, no more weeping,
No more pain.

On the waters dark and drear,
Jesus, Savior, Thou art near,
With our ship where’er it roam,
As with loving friends at home.

On this day, O beautiful Mother,
On this day we give thee our love.
Near the, Madonna, fondly we hover,
Trusting thy gentle care to prove.

On this day, the first of days,
God the Father’s Name we praise;
Who, creation’s Lord and Spring
Did the world from darkness bring.

On this morn we see the dawning
Of a bright and glorious Sun;
Night is banished, shadows fleeing,
Demons scatter, devils run.
To the garden come the women,
Bringing spices for the dead,
Wondering how to plead with soldiers,
Guards of empire, armed and dread.

On this night, most holy, in circumstance lowly,
Unfolded the story which prophets foretold.
Though heav’ns could not hold Him, Mary’s arms enfold Him,
Holding to her bosom this Child Who is God!
The virgin is nursing this wondrous infant King—
The Word that was made flesh to end our despair.
While angels adore Him, shepherds kneel before Him
And kings from the east follow after His star.

On this stone now laid with prayer,
Let Thy church rise, strong and fair;
Ever, Lord, Thy Name be known,
Where we lay this cornerstone.

On what has now been sown
Thy blessing, Lord, bestow;
The power is Thine alone
To make it spring and grow.
Do Thou in grace the harvest raise,
And Thou alone shalt have the praise.

On wings of living light,
At earliest dawn of day,
Came down the angel bright;
And rolled the stone away.

On Zion's glorious summit stood
A numerous host redeemed by blood
They hymned their King in strains divine
I heard the song and strove to join
I heard the song and strove to join

Once again, dear Lord, we pray
For the children far away,
Who have never even heard
Name of Jesus, sweetest word.

Once He came in blessing,
All our ills redressing,
Came in likeness lowly,
Son of God most holy;
Bore the cross to save us,
Hope and freedom gave us.

Once I thought I walked with Jesus,
Yet such changeful feelings had,
Sometimes trusting, sometimes doubting,
Sometimes joyful, sometimes sad.

This is it, now it starts
Stand and watch the curtain rise
Now's your chance, here it is
Standing right before your eyes
The love is right before your eyes!

Once in royal David’s city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little Child.

Once More Before We Part
We'll bless the Savior's name;
Record His mercies, ev'ry heart,
Sing, ev'ry tongue, the same.
Hoard up His sacred word,
And feed thereon and grow;
Go on and seek to know the Lord.
And practice what you know.
And if we meet no more
On Zion's earthly ground,
O may we reach that blissful shore
Where all thy saints are bound.

Once more, my soul, the rising day
Salutes thy waking eyes;
Once more, my voice, thy tribute pay
To Him that rules the skies.

Once more the solemn season calls
A holy fast to keep;
And now within the temple walls
Let priest and people weep.

Once more we come before our God;
Once more His blessings ask:
O may not duty seem a load,
Nor worship prove a task!

Once more, O Lord, Thy sign shall be
Upon the heav’ns displayed,
And earth and its inhabitants
Be terribly afraid:
For not, in weakness clad, Thou com’st,
Our woes, our sins to bear,
But girt with all Thy Father’s might,
His judgment to declare.

Once my way was dark and dreary,
For my heart was full of sin,
But the sky is bright and cheery,
Since the fullness of His love came in.

Once o’er Judea’s hills by night
Was heard a joyful sound,
A host appeared, of angels bright,
And glory shone around.
Fear not, they sing, to you we bring
Glad tidings, peace on earth;
Good will to men, they caroled then,
And sang the Savior’s birth.
On Bethl’em’s plain no more we hear
The wondrous heav’nly chime;
But we can sound a strain as dear,
This joyful Christmas morn.

Once pledged by the Cross,
As children of God,
To tread in the steps
Your Captain has trod,
Now, sealed by the Spirit
Of wisdom and might,
Go forward, Christ’s soldiers,
Go forward and fight!

Once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, some great decision, offering each the bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever, ’twixt that darkness and that light.

Once upon a tree
He died at Calvary
Once upon a tree
He suffered loss
Greatest story told
Starting with these few words
No not with once upon a time
But once upon a tree

Once, only once, and once for all,
His precious life he gave;
Before the cross in faith we fall,
And own it strong to save.

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth
And in my beginning, God made me

If we believe that we should make a new beginning
If we are sure that we can walk the path of love
If we decide to try and make this life worth living
Then we must look within as well as up above

One by one we’re passing over,
One by one we cross the tide;
Soon we’ll reach the peaceful harbor,
Rest at last on Canaan’s side.

One day when Heaven was filled with His praises,
One day when sin was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
Dwelt among men, my Example is He!

One day I traveled a toilsome road
Over the hills of despair;
One day I carried a weary load,
Cumbered with toil and with care.

One day there’ll be new earth and Heaven,
for the first will soon pass away.
And the Holy City, from Heaven
will appear in bridal array.
Then with men God will make his dwelling;
they will be his people indeed.
God himself will be with them
always and their God will ever be.

One holy Church of God appears
Through every age and race,
Unwasted by the lapse of years,
Unchanged by changing place.

One is kind above all others,
O how He loves!
His is love beyond a brother’s;
O how He loves!
Earthly friends may fall and leave thee,
One day kind, the next day grieve thee;
But this Friend will ne’er deceive thee;
O how He loves!

One more day’s work for Jesus,
One less of life for me!
But Heav’n is nearer, 
and Christ is clearer
Than yesterday, to me.
His love and light 
fill all my soul tonight.

One named Lazarus was sick; 
his two sisters feared he’d die.
So to Jesus they sent word, 
hoping He would soon come nigh.
But when He received their word, 
two more days He did abide.
He said, “This won’t end in death; 
rather, I’ll be glorified.
This is for God’s glory great; 
through it I’ll be glorified."

One offer of salvation,
To all the world make known;
The only sure foundation
Is Christ the Cornerstone.

He was standin’ on the corner with a will-work-for-food sign
He said brother can you spare me a thin dime
I promise I’ll make it worth all of your time (your time)
I thought man he was drunk outta his mind
My coin hit his cup and as I turned to go (and as I turned)
He told me things about my life that no one could know (he could not know, he’s been hearin’)
Said I got the message from the Man upstairs
He’s been hearing your prayers

One small hand reaching out to the starlight
One small Savior of love
One small Savior of love
One king bringing his gold and his riches
One king ruling an army of might
One king kneeling with incense and candlelight
One King bringing us life
One King bringing us life
See the shepherds kneeling before him
See the kings on bended knee
See the mother praising the Father
See his tiny eyelids fall
One small child in a land of a thousand
One small dream of a Savior tonight
One small hand reaching out to the starlight
One small Savior of life
One small Savior of life
See the shepherds kneeling before him
See the kings on bended knee
See the mother praising the Father
See his tiny eyelids fall
See the shepherds
See the kings
See his mother
See his tiny eyelids fall

One sole baptismal sign,
One Lord below, above,
Zion, one faith is thine,
One only watchword—love;
From different temples though it rise,
One song ascendeth to the skies.

One there is, above all others,
Well deserves the name of Friend;
His is love beyond a brother’s,
Costly, free, and knows no end:
They who once His kindness prove,
Find it everlasting love!

One thing I ask of the Lord
This is what I seek
One thing I ask of the Lord
This is what I seek
May I dwell in the house of the Lord?
(Dwell in the house of the Lord)
May I dwell in the house of the Lord?
(Dwell in the house of the Lord)
To seek Him in His temple
To gaze upon His beauty

One thing I of the Lord desire,
For all my path hath miry been,
Be it by water or by fire,
O make me clean, O make me clean.

One thing's needful; Lord this treasure
Teach me highly to regard;
All else, though it first give pleasure,
Is a yoke that presses hard.
Beneath it the heart is still fretting and striving,
No true, lasting happiness ever deriving.
The gain of this one thing all loss can requite
And teach me in all things to find true delight.

One Thy Light, the Temple filling,
Holy, Holy, Holy, Three!
Meanest men and brightest angels
Wait alike the word from Thee;
Highest musings, lowliest worship,
Must their preparation be.

One who is all unfit to count
As scholar in Thy school,
Thou of Thy love hast named a friend
O kindness wonderful!

If Jesus would not have come when He did
But was born to be alive here today instead
We might be surprised by the way He would live
And the people He would heal and forgive

Only a beam of sunshine,
But oh, it was warm and bright;
The heart of a weary traveler
Was cheered by its welcome sight.
Only a beam of sunshine;
That fell from the arch above:
And tenderly, softly whispered
A message of peace and love.

’Tis only a little way on to my home,
And there in its sunshine for ever I’ll roam;
While all the day long I journey with song:
O beautiful Eden-land, thou art my home!

Only a little while, sowing and reaping,
Only a little while, our vigil keeping;
Then we shall gather home, no more to sever,
Clasped in eternal love, blest, blest forever.

Naught have I gotten but what I received;
Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
Boasting excluded, pride I abase;
I’m only a sinner, saved by grace!

Only an armor bearer, firmly I stand,
Waiting to follow at the King’s command;
Marching, if  “Onward" shall the order be,
Standing by my Captain, serving faithfully.

Only begotten, 
Word of God eternal,
Lord of Creation, 
merciful and mighty,
List to Thy servants, 
when their tuneful voices
Rise to Thy presence.

Fear not, little flock, from the cross to the throne,
From death into life He went for His own;
All power in earth, all power above,
Is given to Him for the flock of His love.

Only God can bring us gladness,
Only God can give us peace;
Joys are vain that end in sadness,
Joy divine shall never cease.
Mid the shade of want and sorrow
Undisturbed, our hearts rejoice;
Patient, wait the brighter morrow;
Faithful, heed the Father’s voice.

Only in Thee, O Savior mine,
Dwelleth my soul in peace divine,
Peace that the world, though all combine,
Never can take from me.
Pleasures of earth, so seemingly sweet,
Fail at the last my longings to meet;
Only in Thee my bliss is complete,
Only, dear Lord, in Thee!

Do your best while life’s pilgrim way you tread,
Scatt’ring sunshine while you may;
Bear in mind, while the precious seed you spread,
Only once you pass this way.

There's only one (only one, only one)
Only one (only one, only one)
Only one (only one, only one)

There is only one way of salvation--
The glorious way of the cross!
It leads thro' Gethsemane's garden,
Thro' pain, self-denial and loss.
'Tis narrow, but ever abounding
With glimpses of heaven above;
It is rugged, but radiant with glory,
And blazoned with mercy and love.

God blessed me with a son
To carry on my name
But I know the real reason was
To show me why Jesus came
In the middle of the night, if I awake
I will stand and watch him sleeping
Looking down I'll touch his face

The only Son from Heaven,
Foretold by ancient seers,
By God, the Father, given,
In human shape appears;
No sphere His light confining,
No star so brightly shining
As He, our Morning Star.

Crowds are behind Thee, crowds are before,
Life in a single moment Thou canst restore.
Only to touch Thee, spotless and pure,
Only to touch Thy garment, faith brings the cure.

Come, every soul by sin oppressed;
There’s mercy with the Lord,
And He will surely give you rest
By trusting in His Word.

When our way is hedged about us,
And our cross too great to bear,
How the soul to God is lifted,
Thro’ the wondrous power of prayer.

All You ever said before no matter what it was 
It was the truth - ever lovin' truth 
Every time You spoke a word the voice of God was 
Being heard - I know it was truth

Onward, soldiers! onward today!
Christ our Leader calls us away;
Quickly hasten forth to the field,
March with sword and shield.

Onward, Christian, though the region
Where thou art be drear and lone;
God has set a guardian legion
Very near thee; press thou on.

Onward, onward, men of Heaven!
Bear the Gospel’s banner high;
Rest not, till its light is given,
Star of every pagan sky,
Send it where the pilgrim stranger
Faints beneath the torrid ray;
Bid the red browed forest ranger
Hail it, ere he fades away.

Onward, ye pilgrims that journey to Zion,
Sing and be joyful, whatever betide;
Trust in Jehovah, your Lord and your Shepherd,
All that is needed His love will provide.

An open Bible for the world—
May this our glorious motto be!
On ev’ry breeze its flag unfurled
Shall scatter blessings rich and free.

Open my heart to what you know
So I can stretch, so I can grow
My feelings toss me to and fro
Open my heart to what you know

Open now thy gates of beauty,
Zion, let me enter there,
Where my soul in joyful duty
Waits for Him Who answers prayer.
Oh, how blessed is this place,
Filled with solace, light and grace!

Open our eyes, Lord
We want to see Jesus
To reach out and touch Him
And say that we love Him
Open our ears, Lord
And help us to listen
Open our eyes, Lord
We want to see Jesus

Open the windows of Heaven,
Send showers of blessing just now;
Look on us, Lord, in Thy mercy,
While humbly before Thee we bow.

Open, Lord, my inward ear,
And bid my heart rejoice;
Bid my quiet spirit hear
Thy comfortable voice;
Never in the whirlwind found,
Or where earthquakes rock the place,
Still and silent is the sound,
The whisper of thy grace.
From the world of sin, and noise,
And hurry I withdraw;
For the small and inward voice
I wait with humble awe;
Silent am I now and still,
Dare not in thy presence move;
To my waiting soul reveal
The secret of thy love.
Thou didst undertake for me,
For me to death wast sold;
Wisdom in a mystery
Of bleeding love unfold;
Teach the lesson of thy cross,
Let me die, with thee to reign;
All things let me count but loss,
So I may thee regain.
Show me, as my soul can bear,
The depth of inbred sin;
All the unbelief declare,
The pride that lurks within;
Take me, whom thyself hast bought,
Bring into captivity
Every high aspiring thought
That would not stoop to thee.
Lord, my time is in thy hand,
My soul to thee convert;
Thou canst make me understand,
Though I am slow of heart;
Thine in whom I live and move,
Thine the work, the praise is thine;
Thou art wisdom, power, and love,
And all thou art is mine.

Another Sabbath day has come,
Another week is o’er;
And we, a grateful, happy throng,
Are gathered here once more:
We meet to sing of Jesus’ love,
And bow to Him in prayer,
We meet to read His holy Word,
And learn our duty there.

Operator give me information, information
Give me long distance, long distance
Give me heaven (two, three)

Lord, help me live from day to day
In such a self-forgetful way
That even when I kneel to pray
My prayer shall be for—Others.

Our blessed Savior sev’n times spoke
When on the cross our sins He took
And died lest men should perish.
Let us His last and dying words
In our remembrance cherish.

Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
His tender last farewell,
A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed
With us to dwell.

Our country, unrivaled in beauty
And splendor that cannot be told,
How lovely thy hills and thy woodlands,
Arrayed in a sunlight of gold.
The eagle, proud king of the mountain,
Is soaring, majestic and free;
Thy rivers and lakes in their grandeur,
Roll on to the arms of the sea;
Roll on to the arms of the sea.

Our country’s voice is pleading,
Ye men of God, arise!
His providence is leading,
The land before you lies;
Day-gleams o’er it are brightening,
And promise clothes the soil;
Wide fields, for harvest whitening,
Invite the reaper’s toil.

Our day of joy is here again,
With love and peace and song;
Come, let us join th’angelic strain
With voices clear and strong.

Our day of praise is done;
The evening shadows fall;
But pass not from us with the sun,
True Light that lightenest all.

Our earth we now lament to see
With floods of wickedness overflowed,
With violence, wrong, and cruelty,
The killing fields our constant abode,
Where men like fiends each other tear,
In all the hellish rage of war.

Our Father, by whose servants
our house was built of old,
whose hand hath crowned her children
with blessing manifold,
for thine unfailing mercies
far-strewn along our way,
with all who passed before us, 
we praise thy Name today.
The changeful years unresting
their silent course have sped, 
new comrades ever bringing
in comrades' steps to tread;
and some are long forgotten,
long spent their hopes and fears;
safe rest they in thy keeping, 
who changest not with years.
They reap not where they labored;
we reap what they have sown;
our harvest may be garnered
by ages yet unknown.
The days of old have dowered us
with gifts beyond all praise;
our Father, make us faithful
to serve the coming days.
Before us and beside us,
still holden in thine hand
a cloud unseen of witness,
our elder comrades stand:
one family unbroken,
we join, with one acclaim, 
one heart, one voice uplifting
to glorify thy Name.

Our Father has planted a beautiful tree,
Whose evergreen branches His children behold;
They walk ’neath its shade in the City above,
Whose gates are of pearl and whose streets are of 
gold.

Our Father, thy dear Name doth show
the greatness of thy love;
all are thy children here below
as in thy heaven above.
One family on earth are we
throughout its widest span:
O help us everywhere to see
the brotherhood of man.
Alike we share thy tender care;
we trust one heavenly Friend
before one mercy-seat in prayer
in confidence we bend;
alike we hear thy loving call;
one heavenly vision scan,
one Lord, one faith, one hope for all,
the brotherhood of man.
Bring in, we pray, the glorious day
when battle cries are stilled;
when bitter strife is swept away
and hearts with love are filled.
O help us banish pride and wrong,
which since the world began
have marred its peace; help us make strong
the brotherhood of man.
Close knit the warm fraternal tie
that makes the whole world one;
our discords change to harmony
like angel-songs begun:
at last, upon that brighter shore
complete thy glorious plan,
and heaven shall crown for evermore
the brotherhood of man.Charles H.Richards, 1910

Our Father, Thou in heaven above,
Who biddest us to dwell in love,
As brethren of one family,
To cry in every need to Thee,
Teach us no thoughtless word to say,
But from our inmost heart to pray.

Let us be about our Father’s business,
Ev’ry day, as we go
On our way here below:
Never let it suffer thro’ remissness,
But seek to make it thrive and grow.

Our fathers’ God, to Thee we raise,
In cheerful song, our grateful praise;
From shore to shore the anthems rise;
Accept a nation’s sacrifice.

Our Father’s home eternal,
O Christ, Thou dost prepare
With many divers mansions,
And each one passing fair;
They are the victors’ guerdon,
Who, through the hard-won fight,
Have followed in Thy footsteps,
And reign with Thee in light.

Our fathers, in the years grown dim, reared slowly, wall by wall
A holy dwelling place for Him, that filleth all in all.
They wrought His house of faith and prayer, the rainbow round the throne,
A precious temple builded fair on Christ the Cornerstone.

Our Father’s love, so vast and boundless—
His arms of mercy opened wide—
Has sent His Son on earth to save us
Through nail-pierced hands and wounded side.

We welcome with delight
Another happy day,
Our hearts like merry bells
Ring out the silver lay;
We catch the rosy beams
Reflected from the eye
Of Him Whose wonders fill the earth,
Whose glory fills the sky.

Our God has made us one — 
In Him our hearts unite.
When we, His children, share His love, 
Our joy is His delight.
Our God has made us one — 
His glory is displayed.
For as we build each other up 
Our love becomes His praise.
Our God has made us one — 
In sorrow and in joy; 
We share the cross of Christ, our Lord, 
In Him we now rejoice.
Our God has made us one — 
One Church to bear His name; 
One body and one Bride of Christ, 
And with Him we shall reign

There is, beyond the azure blue
A God, concealed from human sight
He tinted skies with heav'nly hue
And framed the worlds with His great might

Our God of love, Who reigns above,
Comes down to us below;
 ’Tis sweet to tell He loves so well,
And ’tis enough to know.

Our Father, unto Thee
We now on bended knee
Our voices raise.
For all Thy love has wrought,
Our life with blessings fraught,
Transcending all our thought,
We speak Thy praise.

Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
Who brings good news, good news;
Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness:
Our God reigns, our God reigns!

Our God, to Whom we turn
When weary with illusion,
Whose stars serenely burn
Above this earth’s confusion,
Thine is the mighty plan,
The steadfast order sure
In which the world began,
Endures, and will endure.

Jesus! what a Friend for sinners!
Jesus! Lover of my soul;
Friends may fail me, foes assail me,
He, my Savior, makes me whole.

Our guilt do we confess today,
Your law did we reject;
So little truth and mercy here—
Your Word sees no respect.

Our heavenly Father calls,
And Christ invites us near;
With both our friendship shall be sweet,
And our communion dear.

Our heav'nly Father, hear
The prayer we offer now.
Thy name be hallowed far and near;
To Thee all nations bow.

Our Helper, God, we bless Thy Name,
Whose love forever is the same;
The tokens of Whose gracious care
Begin and crown and close the year.

Our Jesus walks where the wrecks wash in,
All bruised and sore from the sea of sin;
As each comes in on the rushing tide,
He gently calls from the dark seaside.

Hail! all Hail! great Queen of Heaven,
Hail sweet Notre Dame de Lourde,
Neath whose care our weary exile,
Is from countless ills secured.

“Our land for Christ" we sing;
Our hearts to Him we bring,
And trust His Word;
With His dear cross in view,
Each Christian grace renew,
And make endeavor true
For Christ our Lord.

Our lives, we are told, are but fleeting at best,
Like roses they fade and decay;
Then let us do good while the present is ours,
Be useful as long as we stay.

Our Lord and God, oh, bless this day
And hear us, we implore Thee;
None of Thy children turn away
Who now appear before Thee.
We come before Thy face
And pray: Let Thy rich grace
Descend from Heav’n above
In all Thy wondrous love
And keep us by Thy Spirit.

Our Lord and His disciples at table were as one,
And Jesus thought of the morrow, His work here nearly done.
With one last night together, they knew not what would be,
But Jesus had one final word:
 “Do This; Remember Me!"

Our Lord Christ hath risen! the tempter is foiled;
His legions are scattered, his strongholds are spoiled.
O sing, alleluia! O sing, alleluia!
O sing, alleluia! be joyful and sing,
Our great foe is baffled, Christ Jesus is King!

Our Lord is risen from the dead!
Our Jesus is gone up on high!
The powers of hell are captive led,
Dragged to the portals of the sky.

Our Lord, his passion ended,
hath gloriously ascended,
yet though from him divided,
he leaves us not unguided;
all his benefits to crown
he hath sent his Spirit down,
burning like a flame of fire
his disciples to inspire.
God's Spirit is directing;
no more they sit expecting;
but forth to all the nation
they go with exultation;
that which God in them hath wrought
fills their life and soul and thought;
so their witness now can do
work as great in others too.
The centuries go gliding,
but still we have abiding
with us that Spirit Holy
to make us brave and lowly--
brave, for we feel our need:
God alone is strong indeed;
brave, for with the Spirit's aid
we can venture unafraid.
O Lord of every nation,
fill us with inspiration!
We know our own unfitness,
yet for thee would bear witness.
By thy Spirit now we raise
to the heavenly Father praise:
Holy Spirit, Father, Son,
make us know thee, ever One.

Our Lord is now rejected,
And by the world disowned,
By the many still neglected,
And by the few enthroned,
But soon He’ll come in glory,
The hour is drawing nigh,
For the crowning day is coming by and by.

Our Lord is risen from the dead!
Our Jesus is gone up on high!
The powers of hell are captive led,
Dragged to the portals of the sky.

Our Lord the path of suff’ring trod
And since His blood for man hath flowed,
’Tis meet that man should yield to God
The life he owed.
Alleluia, Alleluia.

I am watching for the coming of the glad millennial day,
When our blessed Lord shall come and catch His waiting bride away.
Oh! my heart is filled with rapture as I labor, watch, and pray,
For our Lord is coming back to earth again.

Joy is in our message!
Peal the Christmas bells!
Joy, great joy re-echoes
From the glory in the story
Which our chimes are telling,
As the music swells;
Ringing, ringing, new joy bringing,
Peal the Christmas bells.

Our mighty God works mighty wonders—
What joy, to seem them all around!
Men’s idols fall before His thunders,
Their altars crumbling to the ground.
He breaks the fetters, frees the slaves,
His fallen children still He saves.

Our nation, God, its heart to Thee upraiseth,
O Lord, the nation bows before Thy face:
With high thanksgiving, Thee Thy glad church praiseth,
Our strength Thy Spir’t, our trust and hope Thy grace.

Our Savior Christ once knelt in prayer
with none but three disciples there,
upon a lonely mountain high
beneath a blue expanse of sky--
below them, far as eye could see,
the little hills of Galilee.
There as he prays a radiance bright
transfigures all his form to light;
high robe in dazzling splendor shows
a purer white than sunlit snows,
while on his countenance divine
transcendent glories burn and shine.
So for a moment stands revealed
what human flesh and form concealed;
while Moses and Elijah share
in earth and heaven mingled there,
with him whom prophecy foresaw,
the true fulfiller of the law.
The shadowed summit, wrapped in cloud,
sounds to a voice that echoes loud,
 "This is my true beloved Son,
listen to him, my chosen one."
The glory fades; with all its pains
the road to Calvary remains.
Give to us, Lord, the eyes to see
as saw those first disciples three:
a teacher true, a friend indeed,
the risen Savior sinners need,
the Son whose praise eternal rings,
the Lord of lords and King of kings!

Our Savior will descend again,
Earth’s buried millions raising;
With Him will come a glorious train,
Adoring Him and praising.

Our Savior’s voice is soft and sweet
When, bending from above,
He bids us gather round His feet,
And calls us by His love.

Our sins, our sorrows, Lord, were laid on Thee;
Thy stripes have healed, Thy bonds have set us free;
And now Thy toil is o’er, Thy grief and pain
Have passed away; the veil is rent in twain.

They’ll never cross the valleys,
Or crystal waters sweet,
They’ll never face the foeman,
When charging armies meet;
O’er mountains, vast and hoary,
O’er hill and grassy plain,
Our soldier heroes sleeping,
Shall never march again.

Our thought of thee is glad with hope,
Dear country of our love and prayer;
Thy way is down no fatal slope,
But up to freer sun and air.

Our youth is transient like a flower,
That blooms, and fades, and dies;
Our life is but a summer cloud,
And like a shadow flies;
Then let us heed the warning voice—
Today its call we hear,
It speaks in deep and solemn tones,
That come from yonder bier.

Out in the sunshine of infinite love,
Breathing the fragrance of Eden above;
I am so happy, O Savior divine,
Living or dying, to know I am Thine.

Out in the wilderness wild and drear,
Sadly I’ve wandered for many a year,
Driven by hunger and filled with fear,
I will arise and go;
Backward with sorrow my steps to trace,
Seeking my heavenly Father’s face,
Willing to take but a servant’s place,
I will arise and go.

Out on an ocean all boundless we ride,
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound;
Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide,
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound;
Far from the safe, quiet harbor we rode,
Seeking our Father’s celestial abode;
Promise of which on us each He bestowed:
We’re homeward bound, homeward bound.

Arise, come ye forth, and forever break the chain,
That long had oppressed you with sorrow and pain;
Arise, come ye forth, hear the blessed Lord’s command,
And He Himself will guide you with a strong, strong hand.

Out of earth’s heart breaking sorrow and anguish
Into eternity’s rapture and calm;
Out of the doubts and the fears where we languish
Into the triumph of victory’s psalm;
Gone is a leader and friend of the people,
Home with the ransomed and numberless throngs,
There to receive the reward of his labors,
Who in the ranks of the martyrs belongs.
Whisper it tenderly sorrowing one,
This was God’s way, His will ever be done.
This was God’s way, this was God’s way,
This was God’s way, His will ever be done.

Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light,
Jesus, I come to Thee;
Out of my sickness, into Thy health,
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into Thyself,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

They dreamed not of danger, those sinners of old,
Whom Noah was chosen to warn;
By frequent transgressions their hearts had grown cold,
They laughed his entreaties to scorn;
Yet daily he called them, “Oh come, sinners, come,
Believe and prepare to embark!
Receive ye the message, and know there is room
For all who will come to the Ark."

Out of the deeps of long distress,
The borders of despair,
I sent my cries to seek Thy grace,
My groans to move Thine ear.

Out of the depths I cry to Thee;
Lord, hear me, I implore Thee!
Bend down Thy gracious ear to me;
I lay my sins before Thee.
If Thou rememberest each misdeed,
If each should have its rightful meed,
Who may abide Thy presence?

Out of the depths I cry to thee,
Lord God! O hear my prayer!
Incline a gracious ear to me,
And bid me not despair:
If thou rememberest each misdeed,
If each should have its rightful need,
Lord, who shall stand before thee?
'Tis through thy love alone we gain
The pardon of our sin;
The strictest life is but in vain,
Our works can nothing win;
That none should boast himself of aught,
But own in fear thy grace hath wrought
What in him seemeth righteous.
Wherefore my hope is in the Lord,
My works I count but dust;
I build not there, but on his word,
And in his goodness trust.
Up to his care myself I yield,
He is my tower, my rock, my shield,
And for his help I tarry.
And though it linger till the night,
And round again till morn,
My heart shall ne'er mistrust thy might,
Nor count itself forlorn.
Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,
Ye of the Spirit born indeed,
Wait for your God's appearing.
Though great our sins and sore our wounds,
And deep and dark our fall,
His helping mercy hath no bounds,
His love surpasseth all:
Our trusty loving Shepherd, he
Who shall at last set Israel free
From all their sin and sorrow.

Out of the depths to the glory above,
I have been lifted in wonderful love;
From every fetter my spirit is free,
For Jesus has lifted me!

Out of the depths to Thee I cry,
Whose fainting footsteps trod
The paths of our humanity,
Incarnate Son of God!

Out on life’s ocean with perils ever nigh,
I have a Pilot on Whom I can rely;
With Him to guide me, life’s storms I can defy,
 ’Tis Christ of Galilee.

Out on the desert, looking, looking,
Sinner, ’tis Jesus looking for thee;
Tenderly calling, calling, calling,
Hither, thou lost one, O come unto Me.

Out where the reapers are toiling
Out where they earnestly call,
Let us away in the morning,
There is a work for us all;
Lifting the vines that are drooping,
Trying their bloom to renew,
Bathing their leaves in a fountain
Purer and sweeter than dew.

Outside the Holy City
Unnumbered footsteps throng,
And crowded mart and streets of trade
Fling back a swelling song.
The voices echo nearer,
In flaming hope they sing:
 “Throw down your branches at His feet!
Hosanna to the King!"

Tell the sweet story of Jesus our King,
Over and over again;
Unto the world of His majesty sing,
Over and over again.

Over Bethl’em’s hillside beamed a glorious star,
With its radiant beauty all so fair
Led the wondrous wise men to the manger bed,
Where the King of kings was cradled there.

O come and go with me,
If from sin you would be free;
You will find it good for thee,
Over Jordan.
 ’Tis a land of corn and wine,
And there’s fruit of every kind;
You will find it is sublime,
Over Jordan.

Over the river my loved ones have passed,
Over the beautiful river;
Safe in the mansions of glory at last,
Now they are watching for me.

Over the hilltops, down from the skies,
Coming from glory—lift up your eyes!
While we are watching, and while we pray,
A mighty revival is sweeping this way.

Over the ocean wave, far, far away,
There the poor heathen live, waiting for day;
Groping in ignorance, dark as the night,
No blessed Bible to give them the light.

Over the river, faces I see,
Fair as the morning, looking for me;
Free from their sorrow, grief and despair,
Waiting and watching patiently there.

Over the river they call me,
Friends that are dear to my heart;
Soon shall I meet them in glory,
Never, no never to part.

Over the rolling sea,
Many the voices appealing to me;
Groping in the darkness they,
And to us for light they pray;
O, their cry rings piteously
O’er the waves of the deep, rolling sea.
Over the rolling sea,
Over the rolling sea!

There’s a battle raging over the land and sea,
True to Christ our Captain we will be;
Satan’s hosts are mighty, fighting for ruin and sin,
But in this great conflict right is sure to win.

Over there where the heathen are dying,
Over there where the sin forces dwell,
We must carry the great salvation,
We must go and the glad story tell.

Overcoming evil day by day,
This our warfare on the Christian way;
Yet unto those that faithful endure,
God has declared that His promise is sure.

Come on and paint me a picture of Jesus
Come on and paint me a picture of the Lord
Come on and paint me a picture of Jesus
Come on and paint me a picture of love
Well you can see it when your out on the sidewalk
And on the walls of the street every day (every day)
Some use the backs of their cars for their God talk
But put on canvas, I wonder what it’d portray
Would the images brought before eyes tell of glory
Of a strength dressed in weakness in a love that was slain (that was slain)
Could the brush really tell the whole story
Of our Savior who died for His claim
Your love in return, could you say that you’ve shown it
Could you honestly tell me (could you honestly tell me) this was someone you knew?
But in the light (light) of salvation have you shown it
If it came down to friendship, tell me could he paint you?
Some of our pictures will differ and it’s well that they do
For each one is a piece and a reflection of truth
Some may think they’ve beheld Him but they’ll miss on the art
But if you want the Masterpiece you must give Him your heart
A picture of love, a picture of love, a picture of love

Listen poor sinner; you're driftin' away 
From the Dear Saviour; who's pleading to- day
What will you do; when the Saviour ain't nigh
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?
The time now ain't long; when the Saviour will come
Then you'll be judged; by the deeds you have done
On that judgement day; you'll weep and you'll cry
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?
When that trumpet sounds; on the sinners below
Not even the angels; in heaven will know
Then's when you'll wish; you had Jesus nigh
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?
Won't you redeem; your poor wicked soul
You can't pay your way; with Silver and Gold
If you're not saved; you'll be lost in the night
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?

Palms of glory, raiment bright,
Crowns that never fade away,
Gird and deck the saints in light,
Priests, and kings, and conquerors they.
Yet the conquerors bring their palms
To the Lamb amidst the throne,
And proclaim in joyful psalms
Victory through His cross alone.
Kings for harps their crowns resign,
Crying, as they strike the chords,
“Take the kingdom, it is Thine,
King of kings, and Lord of lords."
Round the altar priests confess,
If their robes are white as snow,
’Twas the Savior’s righteousness
And His blood that made them so.
They were mortal too like us;
O, when we like them shall die,
May our souls translated thus
Triumph, reign, and shine on high.

As I travel through life with its trouble and strife
I've a glorious hope to give cheer on the way
Soon my toil will be o'er and I'll rest on that shore
Where the night has been turned into day

By the side of the river of life (of the river of life)
Up in paradise valley (up in the valley, the wonderful valley)
We'll be free from all pain and all strife (from all pain and all strife)
There we'll live in the garden (there we shall live in the rose tinted garden)
'Neath the shade of the evergreen tree (of the evergreen tree)
How I long for the paradise valley (for the paradise valley)

With the flowers that bloom in the garden above
In the midst of it grows Sharon's perfect sweet rose

Come to the feast When Jesus told of a certain man
Who was preparing a great big banquet
He sent his servant throughout the land to say
Come to the feast (the feast) 
With all the guests that had been invited
You would have t'ought they'd be so excited but
When it came time for de banquet day
They began to make excuses and say (pardon me) 
Pardon Me (pardon me)
I've just bought some new oxen and I've got to plow (pardon me)
Pardon Me (pardon me)
But I just bought a field and I've got to go check it out (pardon me)
Pardon Me (pardon me)
But my new bride, she's waitin' home for me
And to say de least
I've no time for a feast
Me have to say tank you, but no (me have to say thank you, no, no, no, no) 
(Come to the feast)
Now when the host saw that he'd been had
To tell de trut' he got downright mad
He only wanted his guests to be glad To come to the feast 
He sent his servants t'roughout that town
With invitations to all the down and out
The crippled, poor, and de blind and the lame
Couldn't hear a one of them say (pardon me)
And to say de least
I've no time for a feast
Me have to say tank you, but no (Have to say tank you, no; thank you no) 

Sweeter than all is the love of the Savior,
Dearer by far than earth’s jewels so rare,
Flooding my soul by the grace of His favor,
Filling my heart with the spirit of prayer.
Pardoning grace the Master has spoken,
Pardoning grace has now made me whole;
On Calv’ry’s brow His poor heart was broken—
Pardoning grace for my sin sick soul.
Wonderful thought! how it fills me with singing!
Jesus has spoken, His word is divine;
I can rejoice, for His mercy is bringing
Life that is blessed and sweet into mine.
I am content, for I know He is near me,
Keeping me pure by His wonderful grace,
Whispering words full of comfort to cheer me,
Lighting my soul with a glimpse of His face.
There is a refuge beyond pain and sorrow!
When He shall call me to dwell with Him there
I shall behold, in a brighter tomorrow,
Jesus my King, all His glory to share.

Part in peace: is day before us?
Praise His Name for life and light;
Are the shadows lengthening o’er us?
Bless His care Who guards the night.
Part in peace: with deep thanksgiving,
Rendering, as we homeward tread,
Gracious service to the living,
Tranquil memory to the dead.
Part in peace: such are the praises
God our Maker loveth best;
Such the worship that upraises
Human hearts to heavenly rest.

A parting hymn we sing
Around Thy table, Lord,
Again our grateful tribute bring,
Our solemn vows record.
Here have we seen Thy face,
And felt Thy presence here;
So may the savor of Thy grace,
In word and life appear.
The purchase of Thy blood,
By sin no longer led,
The path our dear Redeemer trod
May we rejoicing tread.
In self forgetting love
Be our communion shown,
Until we join the Church above,
And know as we are known.

It only takes a spark to get a fire going,

Your spread the love to everyone

Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.
Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.
Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief,
Kneeling there in deep contrition;
Help my unbelief.
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.
Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in Heav’n but Thee?

Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,

Passing onward, quickly passing,
But I ask thee, "Whither bound?
Is it to the many mansions
Where eternal rest is found?
Passing onward, passing onward,
Tell me, sinner, whither bound?"
Passing onward, quickly passing;
Naught the wheels of time can stay;
Sweet the tho't that some are going
To the realms of perfect day,
Passing onward, passing onward,
Christ their leader, Christ their way.
Passing onward, quickly passing,
Many on the downward road;
Careless of their souls immortal,
Heeding not the call of God,
Passing onward, passing onward,
Trample on the Saviour's blood.
Passing onward, quickly passing;
Time its course will quickly run;
Still we hear the fond entreaty
Of the ever gracious One:
"Come and and welcome, come and welcome;
'Tis by Me that life is won." 

More and more, I hear your Spirit's call inside
Beckoning my heart with passion for you
More and more, I feel a love is growing inside
Beckoning my heart with love for your son
Love for your Son
(We want a new) Passion for Jesus
One like we've never known
(We want a new) Passion for Jesus
One that will burn in our hearts like never before
You're passing by, can I touch your hem
The veil is torn and we now enter in
Won't you fill us Lord, once again
And breath the breath of life
That only comes from you
And give us passion, give us passion for you
We want passion for you

Let the angel pass us over
Let the angel pass us by
Let the angel pass us over
Let the angel of death pass us by
We are poor Lord, live in bondage
Yet we know Lord, we are thine
We cry freedom from the Pharoah
We await your mighty sign
Blood of lamb upon the doorpost
Sit in silence, hear them cry
Judgement now has come upon them
As their firstborn sons start to die
Let the angel pass us over
Let the angel pass us by (pass us by)
Let the angel pass us over
Let the angel of death pass us by
Oh remind us of your power Lord
Ever mindful of this deed
Guide us through our tribulation
By your power we will all be free
Through the streets, through the homes
Hear the echoes of the moans
The angel of death
Has passed by

Long have they waited in the dark heathen lands
For the pure living water from the dear Savior’s hands;
Still they are waiting for the gospel to come,
Let us hasten to tell them of our heavenly home.
Hark! hear them calling from every dark land,
Who will obey the dear Savior’s command?
Go with the gospel, the rough billows brave,
And lead them to Jesus who only can save.
Long have they waited for the pure living word,
Since the gospel of heaven was proclaimed by the Lord;
“Teach every nation," was the hasty command,
Yet we have not enlightened every dark heathen land.
Patiently waiting for the heavenly light,
Precious souls still are sleeping in a dark, sinful night;
Pity them, brother, oh, how great is their need!
They have no one to teach them, and no Bible to read.
Long have they waited, nearly two thousand years,
Still we leave them in darkness and in dread sinful fears;
Where is the worker who will leave friends and home,
To deliver poor heathens from the wrath that’s to come? 

God of our sires that joyful sang,
While forest shades triumphant rang,
When on the wild New England shore,
Their sails were furled, their voyage o’er.
O Lord, defend Thy children yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend Thy children yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.
God of the brave that sought Thy aid,
And in Thy robe of strength arrayed,
They won for us beneath Thy care,
The flag we prize, the peace we share,
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.
And when the call to arms again
Was heard afar o’er hill and plain,
Thy mighty hand upheld the right,
Thy love restored Thy banner bright,
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.
God of our land, Thy gift so free,
O hear the prayer we breathe to Thee;
Let union’s bond our souls entwine,
And guard alike the palm and pine.
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.

Paul and Peter walked across the land, Told a story of just one man
A Carpenter from Galilee, Healed the sick and made the Blind man see
Yes, Paul and Peter walked, they did not ride,
They had no Chariot, and they could not fly
So Paul and Peter walked, one step at a time,
Across the mountains and the valleys wide
So if it's to far (Travel light~) and if its too tough, (Walk at night~)
And if the road is too rough (Make it smooth),
If you don't have the time (there's a time to loose)
Yes Paul and Peter walked, they sang a song, come ye children walk along
Those who follow, and those in need, they carried children or they did not
sleep
Yes, Paul and Peter walked, they did not run,
through the rain or the burning sun
Some learn it early, some learn it late,
That the road is winding, yet, the road is straight
So if it's to far (Travel light~) and if its too tough, (walk at night~ )
And if its too rough (Make it smooth),
If you don't have the time (there's A time to loose)
So if it's to hard (Travel light~) and if its too tough, (walk at night~ )
And if its too rough (Make it smooth),
If you don't have the time~ (there's a time to loose~)

Paul the preacher, Paul the poet,
Fearless fighter for the truth,
Mystic, pioneer, and prophet,
Builder of the Church's youth;
Foremost of Gamaliel's pupils,
Pharisee of Christian fame,
Great apostle of the Gentiles,
We as Gentiles bless thy name.
Loyal Jew, yet born a Roman,
Citizen, yet slave of Christ,
Wealth, position, kindred, freedom,
To thy Lord were sacrificed.
Still to-day we need thy teaching,
Stern yet loving, hard yet true:
Only those who share his Passion
Can their lives in Christ renew.
Paul the fiery, Paul the saintly,
Worship with us at thy feast;
May our love to Christ be strengthened,
And our faith through thee increased;
Till, when faith no more is needed,
There where faith and sight are one,
We in heaven shall praise the Father
In the Spirit through the Son.

Sweet peace is flowing, peace that will abide;
Peace e’er increasing, Jesus will provide;
Peace like a river in the time of drouth,
Flowing on forever, from the sunny south.
Peace, peace, wonderful peace!
Flowing so deep in my soul;
Peace, peace, sweet peace,
How it maketh the sad heart whole.
Sweet peace in Jesus, never can be told;
Oh, it is glorious, better far than gold;
Showers are falling all around me here,
Peace that is amazing, desert hearts to cheer.
Come, weary sinner, thirsty you may be,
Drink of the water Jesus offers thee;
Oh, it will gladden like the summer rain,
As the blooming Eden, you may then remain.

He says peace, peace be still
Lifts his hands, peace be still
Like a child the winds obey him
When he says peace be still
He says peace, peace be still
Lifts his hands, peace be still
Like a child my heart obeys him
When he says peace be still
Hear his voice peace be still
Holy holy
Holy is the Lamb
Holy holy
Holy is the Lamb

Peace, doubting heart! my God’s I am;
Who formed me man, forbids my fear;
The Lord hath called me by my name;
The Lord protects, for ever near;
His blood for me did once atone,
And still He loves and guards His own.
When passing through the watery deep,
I ask in faith He promised aid,
The waves all awful distance keep,
And shrink from my devoted head;
Fearless their violence I dare;
They cannot harm, for God is there!
To Him mine eye of faith I turn,
And through the fire pursue my way;
The fire forgets its power to burn,
The lambent flames around me play;
I own His power, accept the sign,
And shout to prove the Savior mine.
Still nigh me, O my Savior, stand!
And guard in fierce temptation’s hour;
Hide in the hollow of Thy hand,
Show forth in me Thy saving power,
Still be Thy arms my sure defense,
Nor earth nor hell shall pluck me thence.
Since Thou hast bid me come to Thee,
Good as Thou art, and strong to save
I’ll walk o’er life’s tempestuous sea,
Upborne by the unyielding wave,
Dauntless, though rocks of pride be near,
And yawning whirlpools of despair.
When darkness intercepts the skies,
And sorrow’s waves around me roll,
When high the storms of passion rise,
And half o’erwhelm my sinking soul,
My soul a sudden calm shall feel,
And hear a whisper, “Peace; be still!"
Though in affliction’s furnace tried,
Unhurt on snares and death I’ll tread;
Though sin assail, and hell, thrown wide,
Pour all its flames upon my head,
Like Moses’ bush, I’ll mount the higher,
And flourish unconsumed in fire.

"Peace I give to you,
peace I give to you
Greater than the world can give,
full and true"
Lord I receive Your peace,
Lord I receive Your peace
With open hands
and grateful heart,
I receive
Joy Grace Love

Peace I leave with you, my friends:
Shalom my peace, in all you do.
Peace I leave with you, my friends,
I give to you, so you can give to others, too.
To share God's love is why I came,
To show God's kindness to the world
Go now my friends and do the same,
Until I come again.
Take my hand and be at peace,
The spirit of our love I send;
And with this love you will be free,
Until I come again.
With this love you all will know,
That loneliness is at an end,
Rejoice my people though I go
For I will come again.

Well I’m tired and so weary
But I must go along
‘Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning is bright
And the Lamb, the Lamb is the light
And the night, night is as fair as the day, oh yes
And there will be peace in the valley for me someday
Oh, there will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
Well, there’ll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I’ll see
There will be peace in the valley for me (for me)
Well the flowers will be blooming
And the grass, oh it will be green
And the skies will be clear and serene, oh yes
Well the sun ever beams in this valley of dreams
And no clouds there will ever be seen, oh yes

I see a stable, cold and bare
A virgin mother, pure and fair
The light of heaven surrounds her there
Peace is born on earth
And in a manger, gently laid
A baby slumbers in the hay
A miracle is wrought this day
Peace is born on earth
I see the shepherds come in haste
To look upon their Savior's face
And wise men seek this holy place
Where peace is born on earth
A new star rises in the heavens
I see the skies with glory riven
Unto us a Son is given
Peace is born on earth
Oh listen to the angel song
That heralds this eternal dawn
And through the years the strains prolong
Peace is born
Peace is born
I wonder now if I would know
Like men of wisdom long ago
The star that first was set aglow
When peace was born on earth
For as I lift my eyes afar
To seek the Bright and Morning Star
The light of heaven fills my heart
And peace is born on earth

Peace is flowing like a river,
Flowing out through you and me,
Spreading out into the desert,
Setting all the captives free.
Let it flow through me,
Let it flow through me,
Let the mighty peace of God
Flow out through me.
Let it flow through me,
Let it flow through me,
Let the mighty peace of God
Flow out through me.
Love is flowing.
Joy is flowing.
Faith is flowing.
Hope is flowing.

Peace (peace like a river) like a river (peace like a river)
Flows (flows through my soul) through my soul (flows through my soul)
I've (I've been forgiven) been forgiven (I've been forgiven)
Cleansed (cleansed and made whole) and made whole (cleansed and made whole)
Peace like a river so gently is flowing
How sweet to my soul is this marvelous peace
Sweeter and sweeter each day it is growing
Like billows of glory it never shall cease
Filled (filled with the spirit) with the spirit (filled with the spirit)
I (I am so glad) am so happy (happy and glad)
Jesus (Jesus has given) has given (sweetly has given)
Wonderful (wonderful peace) peace (wonderful peace)

Glory forever to Jesus my Savior
For wonderful, marvelous, heavenly peace
Peace overflowing much sweeter is growing
What wonderful, wonderful peace

Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.
Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?
On Jesus' bosom naught but calm is found.
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.
It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease,
And Jesus call us to heaven's perfect peace 

There comes to my heart one sweet strain,
A glad and a joyous ,
I sing it again and again,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.
Peace, peace, sweet peace,
Wonderful gift from above;
O wonderful, wonderful peace,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.
By Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid,
No other foundation is laid
For peace, the gift of God's love.
When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
My heart with this peace did abound;
In Him the rich blessing I found,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.
In Jesus for peace I abide,
And as I keep close to His side,
There's nothing but peace doth betide,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

Seasons of my soul they come and go
But as they slip away I know
Something else remains that will not change
Places in my heart are torn apart
But in my brokedness I find
Something stays behind that will not change
The peace that passes understanding
Is a blessing that will never fade away
The peace that passes understanding
Is here to stay
The peace that passes understanding
Never passes away
Lord in times alone my heart has known
The quiet words of your tender love
And your gentle touch that changes me
Even through the storm I'm safe and I'm warm
For you have covered me with grace
In your hiding place I am at peace
Peace comes like the dawn
Peace like the world can't understand
You take my hand and I stand
Though others may fall

O Jesus, my Savior,
All glory to Thee;
Sweet peace in believing
Thou givest to me.
Peace, peace to my soul
Flows like a beautiful river;
Peace, hallowed and pure,
Constant abiding forever.
What heights of enjoyment,
What rapture is mine;
While faithfully trusting
Thy promise divine.
Should sorrow o’ertake me,
Thy Word is my stay;
Should trials befall me
Thou guidest my way.
O loving Redeemer,
Whatever Thy will,
In tempests or sunshine,
I’ll follow Thee still.

He says peace, peace be still
Lifts his hands, peace be still 
Like a child the winds obey him
When he says peace be still 
He says peace, peace be still
Lifts his hands, peace be still 
Like a child my heart obeys him
When he says peace be still
Hear his voice peace be still 
Holy holy
Holy is the Lamb

Peace, troubled soul, thou need’st not fear;
Thy great Provider still is near;
Who fed thee last, will feed thee still:
Be calm, and sink into His will.
The Lord, Who built the earth and sky,
In mercy stoops to hear thy cry;
His promise all may freely claim;
Ask and receive in Jesus’ Name.
Without reserve give Christ your heart,
Let Him His righteousness impart;
Then all things else He’ll freely give;
With Him you all things shall receive.
Thus shall the soul be truly blest,
That seeks in God His only rest;
May I that happy person be,
In time and in eternity.

Peaceful the wondrous night,
Peaceful and holy,
Under the silv’ry light,
Gleaming afar.
Faithfully watching there,
Shepherds so lowly,
Over the hills so fair,
Saw glory’s star.
Hail to the starry night,
Sparkling with glory;
Angels on wings of light,
Thronging the sky.
Hail to that starry night!
Wondrous its story:
Jesus the Prince of Light,
Came from above.
Come with that shepherd band,
Come to the manger;
Join in the grand,
Glory to God!
Worship the holy Child,
Wonderful Stranger,
Give to the Undefiled,
Glory and laud.
Sweet favor, thus to bow,
Love’s treasure bringing,
Gratefully yielding now,
Life’s joyful praise.
Hear from the heav’nly height,
Glad echoes ringing,
Blessing and pow’r and might,
Through endless days.

Peacefully round us the shadows are falling,
Glad be our praises and trustful our prayer;
Hear us, O Lord, on Thy providence calling,
Lighten our darkness, and banish our care.
Hushed are the sheep bells afar on the moorland,
O’er the still meadows the night breezes sweep,
Faint fall the footsteps in city and hamlet,
Safely the children are folded in sleep.
Softly may weary ones rest from their duty,
Bright be the dreams of the troubled and worn,
While through the shades beam the stars in their beauty,
Watching the world till the breaking of morn.
Lord of the night, let Thine angels defend us;
Sunshine and gloom are alike unto Thee;
Lord of the day, let Thy Spirit attend us,
Bless us and keep us wherever we be.

One day a child came home from football
Where he had fumbled, been jeered and booed
His mother knew that his heart was breakin'
And so she made him his favorite food
She did not make (a bowl) a bowl of salad greens
She made no whole wheat rolls or a pile of beans
She made him sandwiches on toasted white bread
With peanut butter, creamy style
The years went by and he was a loser
He led a useless and wretched life
His mother never criticized him
She only smiled as she got out the knife
So he decided on the basis
Of a book that he had read that fall
That all his problems had resulted
From excessive cholesterol
And so she made (a bowl) a bowl of salad greens
She made some whole wheat rolls and a pile of beans
She made no sandwiches on toasted white bread
With peanut butter, creamy style
That night his dog died, He wrecked his pick-up
His sweet heart left him, He lost his hair
His house caught fire, He went to prison
His dear old mother came to him there
She made him sandwiches on toasted white bread (you know choosy mothers do choose Jiff)
With peanut butter, creamy style

It's a pearl of great price
And it's worth his life
He was lookin' cross the land
Now it's in his hand
He gave his whole world
For that precious pearl
A pearl of great price 
Is like the kingdom of Heaven 
Jesus told the story 'bout a merchant man
Who was looking for that precious pearl across the land
When he found it he knew (he knew)
Just what to do
He sold everything he owned 
And took that pearl home 
(Pearl of great price)
It's the one you want
(Pearl of great price)
Got to give it all
(Pearl of great price)
When you find it then
You do anything you can
To get it in your hand 
("Get it, got to get it, got to get it" repeated in background)
The one, it's the one you want
You know, when you find it then
Hey, give it all you've got
Got to give it all to get (Get that pearl!) 
He gave his whole world for that precious pearl
A pearl of great price is like the kingdom of Heaven 

I am going to a home bright and fair,
And by faith its pearly gates I see:
Soon I'll be among the blest over there,
For the gates will open wide for me.
Open wide, open wide,
Oh, the gates will open wide for me;
Open wide, open wide,
Yes, the gates will open wide for me.
There's a mansion built for me over there,
Soon my dwelling place in heav'n shall be,
Which my Savior now has gone to prepare,
And the gates will open wide for me.
Let me hasten to my home over there,
With my Savior evermore to be;
Then in spotless robes of white I'll appear,
For the gates will open wide for me.
Yes, I'll enter through the gates by the blood
Which my blessed Jesus shed for me:
He has washed me in the all-cleansing flood,
And the gates will open wide for me.

There’s a holy and beautiful city
Whose Builder and Ruler is God;
John saw it descending from Heaven,
When Patmos, in exile, he trod;
Its high, massive wall is of jasper,
The city itself is pure gold;
And when my frail tent here is folded,
Mine eyes shall its glory behold.
In that bright city, pearly white city,
I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown;
Now I am watching, waiting, and longing,
For the white city that’s soon coming down.
No sin is allowed in that city
And nothing defiling or mean;
No pain and no sickness can enter,
No crepe on the doorknob is seen;
Earth’s sorrows and cares are forgotten,
No tempter is there to annoy;
No parting words ever are spoken,
There’s nothing to hurt or destroy.
No heartaches are known in that city,
No tears ever moisten the eyes;
There’s no disappointment in Heaven,
No envy and strife in the sky;
The saints are all sanctified wholly,
They live in sweet harmony there;
My heart is now set on that city,
And some day its blessings I’ll share.
My loved ones are gathering yonder,
My friends too are passing away,
And soon I shall join their bright number,
And dwell in eternity’s day;
They’re safe now in glory with Jesus,
Their trials and battles are past.
They overcame sin and the tempter,
They’ve reached that fair city at last.

Weary and sad I come, Lord, to Thee,
Low at Thy feet I fall;
Oh, wilt Thou hear my penitent plea,
As I upon Thee call? 
Weary and worn I bring unto Thee
My load of sin and care;
Lord, Thou hast suffered my soul to free,
Wilt Thou my burdens bear? 
May every thought of self now depart
From this poor heart of mine;
And wilt Thou peace and glory impart—
Make me entirely Thine? 
I sink beneath the all-cleansing wave,
Which now by faith I see;
Simply I trust Thy power to save,
Oh, let me rise in Thee.

To me the Holy Ghost is giv’n,
An earnest of the joys of Heav’n;
Since He has taken full control,
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.
I’ve Pentecost in my soul,
I’ve Pentecost in my soul;
The Spirit has come, has come to abide;

And breaks the pow’r of pardoned sin;
Tho’ o’er my head dark clouds may roll,
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.

He purifies and makes me whole—
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.
Then seek this Gift without delay,
Receive the Holy Ghost today;
Yield all to His benign control,

O yes!

Lord, as of old, at Pentecost,
Thou didst Thy power display,
With cleansing, purifying flame,
Descend on us today.
Lord, send the old-time power, the Pentecostal power!
Thy floodgates of blessing, on us throw open wide!
Lord, send the old-time power, the Pentecostal power!
That sinners be converted and Thy Name glorified!
For mighty works for Thee, prepare
And strengthen every heart;
Come, take possession of Thine own,
And never more depart.
All self consume, all sin destroy!
With earnest zeal endue
Each waiting heart to work for Thee;
O Lord, our faith renew!
Speak, Lord! before Thy throne we wait,
Thy promise we believe,
And will not let Thee go until
The blessing we receive.

To me the Holy Ghost is giv’n,

People draw near to God in their distress,
pleading for help and begging peace and bread,
rescue from guilt and sickness, nearly dead.
Christian or not, all come in helplessness.
People draw near when they see God's distress:
find God rejected, homeless, without bread,
burdened with sin and weakness, nearly dead.
Christians reach out to meet God's wretchedness.
And God draws near to people in distress,
feeding their souls and bodies with his bread;
Christian or not, for both he's hanging dead,
forgiving, from the cross, their wickedness.

People get ready there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no ticket, get on board
All you need is faith to hear that diesel hummin'
Don't need no ticket, just thank the Lord
There's a train comin', comin' down the track
All the people who ain't ready better step on back
All you need is faith to hear that diesel hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just get on board
All aboard, (you'd better) get on board (get on board)
All aboard, get on board (come on, get on board)
Faith is the key that opens doors to boarders
Picking up passengers from coast to coast
All you need is faith to hear the diesel hummin'
Don't need no ticket to meet the Lord of hosts
Are you ready? - yes we're ready
Are you ready? - yes we're ready
Are you ready? - yes we're ready
Are you ready? - yes we're ready
Come on, get on board - All aboard, get on board 

Every nation, power and tongue will bow down to Your name;
Ev'ry eye will see, ev'ry ear will hear Your name proclaimed
And this is going to be our cry until You come again
"Jesus is the only name by which man can be saved."

Are calling Your name, living in Your love.

Makes you wan-na dance, makes you wanna sing,
Makes you want to shout all about it, shout all about it,
Shout it that Jesus is King.
Makes you wan-na dance, makes you wanna sing,
Makes you want to shout all about it, shout all about it,
Shout it that Jesus is King.

Everyday they pass me by, I can see it in their eyes.
Empty people filled with care, headed who knows where.
On they go through private pain, living fear to fear,
Laughter hides their silent cries, only Jesus hears.
People need the Lord, people need the Lord.
At the end of broken dreams, He's the open door.
People need the Lord, people need the Lord.
When will we realize.people need the Lord?
We are called to take His light to a world where wrong seems right.
What would be too great a cost for sharing life with one who's lost.
Thorough His love our hearts can feel all the grief they bear.
They must hear the words of life only we can share.
That we must give our lives for
People need the Lord, people need the Lord.

People of the living God,
I have sought the world around;
Paths of sin and sorrow trod,
Peace and comfort nowhere found:
Now to you my spirit turns—
Turns a fugitive unblest;
Brethren, where your altar burns,
Oh, receive me into rest.
Lonely I no longer roam
Like the cloud, the wind, the wave;
Where you dwell shall be my home,
Where you die shall be my grave;
Mine the God Whom you adore;
Your Redeemer shall be mine;
Earth can fill my soul no more—
Every idol I resign.
Tell me not of gain and loss,
Ease, enjoyment, pomp, and pow’r;
Welcome poverty and cross,
Shame reproach, affliction’s hour.
“Follow Me"—I know Thy voice;
Jesus, Lord, Thy steps I see;
Now I take Thy yoke by choice,
Light Thy burden now to me.

The people that in darkness walked
Have seen a wondrous light,
A light that beamed afar,
The bright and morning star,
And those that dwelt in death’s dark vale
Have felt their joy increase,
Their constant theme shall be,
“All hail the Prince of Peace."
Wonderful, Counselor!
The everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace,
Wonderful, Counselor!
The everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace.
As men rejoice when they divide
The spoils which they have gained,
So shall it ever be,
When Christ shall set them free.
For He shall break the shoulder’s staff,
The rod of the oppressed,
And every battle won,
As victors we shall rest.
For unto us a Child is born,
To us a Son is giv’n;
His kingdom shall increase,
And never, never cease,
Upon the throne of David shall
He reign forevermore,
Till ev’ry knee shall bow
And ev’ry heart adore.

A perfect path of purest grace,
Unblemished and complete,
Was Thine, Thou spotless Nazarite,
Pure, even to the feet.
Thy stainless life, Thy lovely walk,
In every aspect true,
From the defilement all around,
No taint of evil drew.
No broken service, Lord was Thine,
No change was in Thy way;
Unsullied in Thy holiness,
Thy strength knew no decay.
The vow was on Thee—Thou didst come,
To yield Thyself to death;
And consecration marked Thy path,
And spoke in every breath.
Morning by morning Thou didst wake,
Amidst this poisoned air;
Yet no contagion touched Thy soul,
No sin disturbed Thy prayer.
Thus, Lord we love to trace Thy course,
To mark where Thou hast trod,
And follow Thee with loving eye,
Up to the throne of God.

Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.
It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease,
And Jesus call us to heaven's perfect peace 

The perfect world, by Adam trod,
Was the first temple built by God;
His fiat laid the corner stone,
And heaved its pillars one by one.
He hung its starry roof on high,
The broad expanse of azure sky;
He spread its pavement, green and bright,
And curtained it with morning light.
The mountains in their places stood,
The sea, the sky; and all was good;
And when its first pure praises rang,
The morning stars together rang.
Lord, ’tis not ours to make the sea,
And earth, and sky, a house for Thee;
But in Thy sight our offering stands,
A humbler temple, made with hands.

Perishing souls at stake today!
Says the banner of Christ unfurled;
Pleading in love for help to save
Blood-bought sinners all o’er the world.
Perishing souls at stake, my brother,
What is all this world beside?
Perishing souls at stake, my brother,
For whom the blessed Savior died;
Perishing souls, perishing souls,
Oh, who will help to save the lost? 
Perishing souls at stake we see,
Yet the Savior has died for all;
Go and invite them earnestly,
Some will surely obey the call.
Perishing souls at stake today,
There’s a famine in all the land;
Many are dying for the bread
Freely given by Jesus’ hand.
Perishing souls at stake, go tell
What the Savior has done for you;
How He redeemed thy soul from hell,
And is able to save them, too.
Perishing souls at stake we know,
Oh, do pity the sinner’s fate!
Brother and sister, will you go,
Give them warning before too late.
Perishing souls at stake today,
Can you tarry for earthly dross?
Fly to the rescue, don’t delay,
Bring the needy to Jesus’ cross.

When I was down in Egypt land
I saw his face and man I ran
I could tell there was no love in that man
O Pharoah a wicked evil man
He had a heart as cold as ice
He could have changed but he never did try
So God let it grow it got colder than snow
Pharoah he was a wicked evil man 
Pharoah a wicked man
O Pharoah a wicked evil man
When I was down in Egypt land
Pharoah a wicked evil man 
When Moses turned the water of the Nile to blood
Pharoah should've realized the hole that he dug
Cause in came the frogs, the gnats, and the flies
But Pharoah just kept tellin' Moses lies
Well death to the livestock, boils, and hail
Locust, darkness, and the first born wail
Pharoah he finally couldn't take anymore (couldn't take anymore)
He said: get your crazy people and head out the door 
Moses and the people they booked it out
And Pharoah he started to have his doubts
What have we done we've let those Israelites go
Now no one is serving us Oh No!
So all of Pharoahs horses and all their men
Jumped in their chariots and chased after them
And all of God's people so faithful and brave said:
Moses why'd you bring us here to dig our grave?
So Moses stretched his hand out over the sea
And God made a path so that they could be free
When Pharoah and his army were close to the shore
The waters came down ...
And Egypt knew God was Lord! 
Pharoah a wicked evil man
Pharoah now let my people go (home) 

When I was down in Egypt land

When Pharoah and his army were close to the shore
The waters came down ...
And Egypt knew God was Lord! 
Pharoah a wicked evil man
Pharoah now let my people go (home) 

Philip went out from Jerusalem
He was looking for a soul to heal
He was Spirit led and the angel said
Go and find the one that God will reveal
So he headed for a place called Gaza
Don't you know it was a desert road
There's a eunuch there with his Chariot's fare
Wonderin' who will tell him what he should know
He was readin' from the prophets of old 
Don't you know
That His coming was foretold
Can't you see
That He came for you and for me
He was led like a sheep to the slaughter
He was silent at the hand of the shear
They deprived Him any measure of justice
And His life was taken from the Earth 
You know Philip went up to the Chariot
And he said do you know what you read
Tell me how can I was the Eunuch's reply
Unless someone will explain it to me
Tell me who does the prophet speak of
Is it him or is it some other one
Philip started with that, he told him where it was at
As he told him of the news of God's son
Philip told him that the Saviour had come 
As they traveled a little farther
They saw water by the side of the road
There is water here and you've made it clear
What I need to do to put on the Lord
So the two of them went down in the water
For the cleansing of the eunuch's sin
Philip's day was made, the spirit took him away
And the eunuch never saw him again
He was singing hallelujah Amen 
Don't you know
That His coming was foretold
Can't you see
That He came for you and for me
And don't you know
Can't you see
Don't you know
That He came for you and for me

When I wake up in the mornin’ and I hear the telephone ring
A tear falls down from my eye and I don’t feel anything
Where does the sun rise, is it beautiful today?
I wish you were here to tell me, I know what you would say
Just a phone call from heaven to hear your voice again
I wasn’t through talking to you why did it have to end
Just a phone call from heaven to say you’re doing fine
Even though you’re not beside me you are always on my mind
In the kitchen I can hear your words spoken oh so clear
And in the fields I hear your laughter and it sounds very near
My heart aches to see your face again or touch you one more time
Soon I will be with you the answers I will find
And the Lord will take good care of you in the beauty of His place
I trust that He will lead me through till we’re standing face to face
'Til I'm walking right beside you, you are always on my mind

I will give you my life, oh my Lord
I will give you my heart, my Savior
Oh Father please take me in
I thank you God for forgiving my sin
I bow down on my knees to praise you
Because that's all that I want to do
You are my Lord and I give you my all
Please pick me up and not let me fall
I give you my soul and I give you my love
I know that you are watching from above
You know my every deed
You provide for me all of my needs
You are the Christ you are the King
I give you my mind, my everything
Thank you Lord for sending your son
I love you God for all that you've done

A pilgrim through this lonely world
The blessed Savior passed;
A mourner all His life was He,
A dying Lamb at last,
A dying Lamb at last.
That tender heart that felt for all,
For all its life blood gave;
It found on earth no resting place
Save only in the grave,
Save only in the grave.
Such was our Lord; and shall we fear
The cross with all its scorn?
Or love a faithless, evil world,
That wreathed His brow with thorn,
That wreathed His brow with thorn?
No! facing all its frowns or smiles,
Like Him, obedient, still,
We homeward press through storm or calm
To Zion’s blessed hill,
To Zion’s blessed hill.
By faith His boundless glories there
Our wondering eyes behold;
Those glories which eternal years
Shall never all unfold;
Shall never all unfold.

Pilgrim, burdened with thy sin,
Come the way to Zion’s gate:
There, till mercy lets thee in,
Knock, and weep, and watch, and wait.
Knock—He knows the sinner’s cry;
Weep—He loves the mourner’s tears;
Watch, for saving grace is nigh;
Wait, till heavenly light appears.
Hark, it is the Bridegroom’s voice:
“Welcome, pilgrim to thy rest!"
Now within the gate rejoice,
Safe, and sealed, and bought, and blest
Safe, from all the lures of vice;
Sealed, by signs the chosen know;
Bought by love, and life the price;
Blest, the mighty debt to owe.
Holy pilgrim, what for thee
In a world like this remain?
From thy guarded breast shall flee
Fear, and shame, and doubt, and pain;
Fear, the hope of Heav’n shall fly;
Shame, from glory’s view retire;
Doubt, in certain rapture die;
Pain, in endless bliss expire.

Slow to anger, full of kindness,
Rich in mercy, Lord, Thou art,
Wash me in Thy healing fountain,
Take away my sinful heart.

Slow to anger, full of kindness,
Rich in mercy, Lord, Thou art,
Wash me in Thy healing fountain,
Take away my sinful heart.
I would go the pilgrim’s journey,
Onward to the promised land;
I would reach the golden city,
There to join the angel band.
Thou wilt never, never leave me,
If I give myself to Thee,
Teach, O teach me how to praise Thee,
Tell me what my life should be.
May Thy ever gracious spirit,
Lead me in the way of truth,
May I learn the voice of wisdom,
In the early days of youth.
O! how sweet to rest confiding,
On Thy Word that cannot fail,
Strong in Thee, whate’er my trials,
Through Thy grace I must prevail.

Pilot divine, and Lord of all on high
Thine are the starry squadrons of the sky!
Lead us whose wings for freedoms sake now soar,
Into our hearts thy faith and courage pour
Oh hear our prayer.
Set Thou our course whose trust is laid in Thee!
Oh Thou who chartest all eternity!
Through cloud and sunshine, through darkest night
Guide Thou our wings who battle for the right
Oh hear our prayer.
Father and friend, in whose almighty name
We dedicate our lives to freedom's flame,
Bless now our wings as on through space we wend.
Bless us who to Thy care our souls commend
Oh hear our prayer.

Out on life’s ocean with perils ever nigh,
I have a Pilot on Whom I can rely;
With Him to guide me, life’s storms I can defy,
’Tis Christ of Galilee.
He is my Pilot on life’s stormy sea,
This wondrous Man of Galilee;
I’m safe in His keeping,
Tho’ storms are round me sweeping,
This Pilot of Galilee.
Wondrous His power and matchless is His skill,
Billows and tempests obey His sov’reign will.
Hushed into silence at His blest “Peace, be still,"
This Man of Galilee.
Fierce was the tempest once raging in my soul,
When of my bark He, my Pilot, took control.
With voice commanding above the thunder’s roll,
This Man of Galilee.
Hear it, ye storm-tossed, upon the sea of sin,
Why will ye not take the heav’nly Pilot in?
Safely He’ll guide you the haven blest to win,
This Man of Galilee.

I have a daughter who's five years old, 
She's got a lot of energy.
We have some dreams for her you see.
She's puttin' on Momma's shoes 'cause she wants to be a lady 
And that's just what we want for her to be.
I wanna grow older, I wanna feel the rays of the morning light.
I wanna grow older, I wanna see the shades of the evening light.
Piper's a girl who's five years old, 
She's a joy to her family.
They have some dreams for her you see.
She's puttin' on Momma's shoes 'cause she wants to be a lady 
And that's just what we want for her to be.
Why not be part of this prayer too?
You can help Piper's dream come true 
I wanna grow older, I wanna feel the rays of the morning light
I wanna grow older, I wanna feel the light
I wanna grow older

Pity A Helpless Sinner, Lord
Who would believe the gracious word,
But own my heart with shame and grief,
A sink of sin and unbelief.
Lord, in thy house I read there's room,
And, venturing, behold I come;
But can there, tell me, can there be,
Amongst thy children, room for me?
I eat the bread, and drink the wine;
But oh! My would wants more than sign!
I faint unless I feed on thee,
And drink the blood as shed for me.
For sinners, Lord, thou camest to bleed,
And I'm a sinner vile indeed;
Lord, I believe thy grace is free;
O magnify that grace in me.

There is a way to see with Christ unto a man (way to see with unto man)
But the in there of are the ways of death (in there of.death)
There is a way to see with Christ unto a man (way to see with unto man)
But the in there of are the ways of death (in there of.death) 
Not everyone who says unto me Lord, Lord (one that says to me Lord, Lord)
Shall enter in to the Kingdom of Heaven (enter in to Heaven)
Not everyone who says unto me Lord, Lord (one that says to me Lord, Lord)
Shall enter in to the Kingdom of Heaven (enter in to Heaven) 
But whosoever shall call on (on the Lord) the name of the Lord (shall be saved)
But without faith it's impossible to please Him
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is (cometh to, must believe that 
He is)
And that He is a rewarder of them that dilligently (seek) seek Him 
I tell you, "Nay except ye repent"
Ye shall all likewise parish
I tell you, "Nay except ye repent"
Ye shall all likewise parish 
And whosoever confesses me before men (who so confesses men)
Will also confess before my father (also confess for Him)
For with a mouth confession is made unto salvation
For with a mouth confession is made unto salvation 
Men and bretheren what shall we do? 
Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ (be baptized 
in the name of Jesus Christ)
Unto the remission of your sins
And now why terriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins (be 
baptized and wash away thy sins)
Calling on the name of the Lord 
And now why terriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins (be 
baptized and wash away thy sins)
Calling on the name of the Lord
Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ (be baptized

And ye shall receive the remission of your sins 
And the gift of the Holy Spirit (Spirit, the gift of the Holy Spirit)
The gift of the Holy Spirit (beautiful gift, the gift of the Holy Spirit)
(Unto death) Be faithful unto death 

Pleasant are Thy courts above,
In the land of light and love;
Pleasant are Thy courts below
In this land of sin and woe;
O, my spirit longs and faints
For the converse of Thy saints,
For the brightness of Thy face,
For Thy fullness, God of grace.
Happy birds that sing and fly
Round Thy altars, O most High;
Happier souls that find a rest
In a heavenly Father’s breast;
Like the wandering dove that found
No repose on earth around,
They can to their ark repair,
And enjoy it ever there.
Happy souls, their praises flow
Even in this vale of woe;
Waters in the desert rise,
Manna feeds them from the skies;
On they go from strength to strength,
Till they reach Thy throne at length,
At Thy feet adoring fall,
Who hast led them safe through all.
Lord, be mine this prize to win,
Guide me through a world of sin,
Keep me by Thy saving grace,
Give me at Thy side a place;
Sun and shield alike Thou art,
Guide and guard my erring heart.
Grace and glory flow from Thee;
Shower, O shower them, Lord, on me

Helping souls
Feeding the hungry
Taking care of those in need
Faithful works
Did you ever consider
The reason behind all of these? 
Do we give them bread
Just to take care of their hunger?
Do we help the poor
Just because it is good?
Are the faithful works
Just to make us feel better? 
What's the bottom line? 
Pleasing Him, pleasing Him
We make that our goal
A greater aim has no one
Nor has there ever been
So we make it our goal to please Him 
Watching your tongue
Trying to be selfless
Raisin' children in the light
Keeping your word
Loving your neighbor
Why should we be living right? 
Do we keep our words pure
To keep down the pollution?
Live the golden rule
'Cause it's nice to do?
Are we telling the truth
For the feeling it gives us? 
What's the reason for it all? 
Why does your heart
Seem to be troubled?
Lost within a world of aims
We should all turn back
To our solid foundation
How good and simple it remains 
In the church
Most the time on time
Tryin' to keep our list of goals
Tellin' the lost
But are they perceivin'
The motivation in our souls? 
Do we go to the church
So nobody will call us?
Are we sharing our faith
'Cause it's what we're told?
Do we know for ourselves
Without any reservation
What's the purpose that we hold? (that we hold) 
Yes we make it our goal to please Him (let's please Him, let's please Him)

I got up one Sunday morning
Went to church at ten
I listened to the words I'd heard time and time again
The preacher spoke of sinful eyes
It seemed he spoke of mine
But I was young
I had plenty of time 
Plenty of time to decide where I'm bound
To eternal darkness or to a heavenly crown
I'm just a young man
Not yet in my prime
So I'll just wait
I've got plenty of time 
You know as I was traveling down life's highway
Living just the way I wanted to live
I was out to beat the other guy
And to try to get whatever life could give
Now I know that making money, that wasn't a sin
And having fun, that wasn't a crime
I thought I'd wait
I had plenty of time 
Before I knew what had happened, life seemed to have passed away
And millions stood before God's throne for it was Judgment Day
Now eternal darkness blackens and the name he calls is mine
But I had thought that I had plenty of time 
Eternity waits
I've got plenty of time to think of all the days Christ could have been in mine
My chance is over
Life's days are left behind
And here am I, I've got plenty of time
Now I've got nothing, but plenty of time

Plunged in a gulf of dark despair
We wretched sinners lay,
Without one cheerful beam of hope,
Or spark of glimmering day.
With pitying eyes the Prince of grace
Beheld our helpless grief;
He saw, and, O amazing love!
He ran to our relief.
Down from the shining seats above
With joyful haste He fled,
Entered the grave in mortal flesh,
And dwelt among the dead.
He spoiled the powers of darkness thus,
And brake our iron chains;
Jesus hath freed our captive souls
From everlasting pains.
In vain the baffled prince of hell
His cursed projects tries
We that were doomed his endless slaves
Are raised above the skies.
O for this love let rocks and hills
Their lasting silence break,
And all harmonious human tongues
The Savior’s praises speak.
Yes, we will praise Thee, dearest Lord,
Our souls are all on flame;
Hosannah round the spacious earth
To Thine adored Name.
Angels, assist our mighty joys,
Strike all your harps of gold;
But when you raise your highest notes,
His love can ne’er be told.

Poor and afflicted, Lord are thine;
Among the great unfit to shine;
But though the world may think it strange,
They would not with the world exchange.
Poor and afflicted, yet they trust
In God, the gracious, wise, and just;
For them he deigns this lot to choose,
Nor would they dare his will refuse.
Poor and afflicted, oft they are
Sorely oppressed with want and care;
Yet he who saves them by his blood,
Makes every sorrow yeild them good.
Poor and afflicted--yet they sing,
For Christ, their glorious, conq'ring King,
Through suff'rings perfect, reigns on high,
And does their every need supply.
Poor and afflicted--yet ere long,
They'll join the bright celestial throng,
And all their suff'rings then shall close,
And heav'n afford them sweet repose.
Poor and afflicted, filled with grief--
O Lord, afford us kind relief,
To cheer the heart that heaves a sigh,
And wipe the tears from every eye.

Poor Esau repented too late
That once he his birth-right despised;
And sold, for a morsel of meat,
What could not too highly be prized:
How great was his anguish when told,
The blessing he sought to obtain,
Was gone with the birth-right he sold,
And none could recall it again!
He stands as a warning to all,
Wherever the Gospel shall come;
O hasten and yield to the call,
While yet for repentance there’s room!
Your season will quickly be past,
Then hear and obey it today;
Lest when you seek mercy at last,
The Savior should frown you away.
What is it the world can propose?
A morsel of meat at the best!
For this are you willing to lose
A share in the joys of the blest?
Its pleasures will speedily end,
Its favor and praise are but breath;
And what can its profits befriend
Your soul in the moment of death?
If Jesus for these you despise,
And sin to the Savior prefer;
In vain your entreaties and cries,
When summoned to stand at His bar:
How will you His presence abide?
What anguish will torture your heart?
The saints all enthroned by His side,
And you be compelled to depart.
Too often, dear Savior, have I
Preferred some poor trifle to Thee;
How is it Thou dost not deny
The blessing and birth-right to me?
No better than Esau I am,
Though pardon and Heaven be mine;
To me belongs nothing but shame,
The praise and the glory be Thine.

Pour out Thy Spirit from on high;
Lord, Thine assembled servants bless;
Graces and gifts to each supply,
And clothe Thy priests with righteousness.
Within Thy temple when they stand,
To teach the truth, as taught by Thee,
Savior, like stars in Thy right hand
May all Thy Church’s pastors be.
Wisdom and zeal and faith impart,
Firmness with meekness, from above,
To bear Thy people in their heart,
And love the souls whom Thou dost love:
To watch and pray and never faint,
By day and night, strict guard to keep,
To warn the sinner, cheer the saint,
Nourish Thy lambs, and feed Thy sheep.
Then, when their work is finished here,
May they in hope their charge resign;
When the Chief Shepherd shall appear,
O God, may they and we be Thine.

Pour Thy blessings, Lord, like showers,
On these barren lives of ours;
Warm and quicken them with grace
Till they bloom and bear apace
Fruit of prayer and fruit of praise,
Holy thoughts and kindly ways,
Loving sacrifices shown
Wheresoever need is known.
Chiefest, Lord, today may we
In the sick and suffering see,
Those whom Thou would’st have us bless
With fraternal tenderness,
With our treasure freely poured,
With compassion’s richer hoard,
With these ministries most dear
To Thy stricken children here.
Heavy is the cross they bear,
But our love that cross can share;
Dark Thy providence must seem,
But our cheer can cast a gleam
On their lot; and in our turn
Holiest lessons we may learn,
Where Thine own revealing light
Streams through pain’s mysterious night.

A poor wayfaring Man of grief
Hath often crossed me on my way,
Who sued so humbly for relief
That I could never answer nay.
I had not power to ask his name,
Whereto he went, or whence he came;
Yet there was something in his eye
That won my love; I knew not why.
Once, when my scanty meal was spread,
He entered; not a word he spake,
Just perishing for want of bread.
I gave him all; he blessed it, brake,
And ate, but gave me part again.
Mine was an angel’s portion then,
For while I fed with eager haste,
The crust was manna to my taste.
I spied him where a fountain burst
Clear from the rock; his strength was gone.
The heedless water mocked his thirst;
He heard it, saw it hurrying on.
I ran and raised the suff’rer up;
Thrice from the stream he drained my cup,
Dipped and returned it running o’er;
I drank and never thirsted more.
’Twas night; the floods were out; it blew
A winter hurricane aloof.
I heard his voice abroad and flew
To bid him welcome to my roof.
I warmed and clothed and cheered my guest
And laid him on my couch to rest;
Then made the earth my bed, and seemed
In Eden’s garden while I dreamed.
Stripped, wounded, beaten nigh to death,
I found him by the highway side.
I roused his pulse, brought back his breath,
Revived his spirit, and supplied
Wine, oil, refreshment—he was healed.
I had myself a wound concealed,
But from that hour forgot the smart,
And peace bound up my broken heart.
In pris’n I saw him next, condemned

Oooo, I'm poor, I'm blind, I'm weak
Oooo, I'm poor, I'm blind, I'm weak
(Repeat) 
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
While wandering through this world of woe
But there's no sickness (there's no sickness), toil or danger (no danger)
In that fair land to which I go
I'm goin' there to meet my mother (I'm goin home) 
I'm goin' there no more to roam
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm just going, going over home
[ background is laid underneath:]
I know dark clouds will gather round me
I know my way is rough and steep
But golden fields lie out before me
Where God's redeemed shall never weep
You know I'm gonna leave this land
With its cold and heartless ways
You know I'm gonna leave this land
One of these good ole days
I'm goin' there (I'll be goin) to meet my brothers
(Yes, I am) Going there (I'm going) no more to roam
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin'.
Said I'm only going, oh, yeah, to meet my Savior oh, yeah
I'm going to sing His praises
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'm goin' home
Going home, sweet home, my home
I am going home, sweet home, my home
(Repeat)
I'm poor, I'm blind, I'm weak

To meet a traitor’s doom at morn.
The tide of lying tongues I stemmed,
And honored him ’mid shame and scorn.
My friendship’s utmost zeal to try,
He asked if I for him would die.
The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill,
But my free spirit cried, “I will!"
Then in a moment to my view
The stranger started from disguise.
The tokens in His hands I knew;
The Savior stood before mine eyes.
He spake, and my poor name He named,
“Of Me thou hast not been ashamed.
These deeds shall thy memorial be;
Fear not, thou didst them unto Me."

Poor, weak and worthless though I am
I have a rich almighty Friend;
Jesus, the Savior, is His Name;
He freely loves, and without end.
He ransomed me from hell with blood,
And by His power my foes controlled;
He found me wandering far from God,
And brought me to His chosen fold.
He cheers my heart, my wants supplies,
And says that I shall shortly be,
Enthroned with Him above the skies;
O what a Friend is Christ to me!
But, ah! my inmost spirit mourns;
And well my eyes with tears may swim,
To think of my perverse returns:
I’ve been a faithless friend to Him.
Often my gracious Friend I grieve,
Neglect, distrust, and disobey;
And often Satan’s lies believe
Sooner than all my Friend can say.
He bids me always freely come,
And promises whate’er I ask:
But I am straitened, cold and dumb,
And count my privilege a task
Before the world that hates His course,
My treach’rous heart has throbbed with shame;
Loath to forego the worlds applause,
I hardly dare avow His Name.
Sure, were I not most vile and base,
I could not thus my Friend requite!
And were not He the God of grace,
He’d frown and spurn me from His sight.

Portal of the world's salvation,
lo, a Virgin pure and mild,
humble-hearted, high in station,
form of beauty undefiled,
crown of earth's anticipation,
comes the Mother-maid with child.
Here the serpent's power subduing,
see the bush unburned by fire,
Gideon's fleece of heaven's imbuing,
Aaron's rod of bright attire,
fair, and pure, and peace-ensuing,
spouse of Solomon's desire.
Jesse's branch received its flower,
Mother of Emmanuel,
portal sealed and mystic bower
promised by Ezekiel,
rock of Daniel's dream, whose power
smote, and lo, the image fell!
See in flesh so great a wonder
by the power of God ordained,--
him, whose feet all worlds lay under,
in a Virgin's womb contained;--
so on earth, her bonds to sunder,
righteousness from heaven hath rained.
Virgin sweet, with love o'erflowing,
to the hills in haste she fares;
on a kindred bestowing
blessing from the joy she bears;
waiting while with mystic showing
time the sacred birth prepares.
What fair joy o'ershone that dwelling,
called so great a guest to greet;
what her joy whose love compelling
found a rest for Mary's feet,
when, the bliss of time foretelling,
lo, the Voice and Word did meet!
God most high, the heaven's foundation,
ruler of eternity;
Jesus, who for man's salvation
came in flesh to make us free;
Spirit, moving all creation,
evermore be praise to thee!

Here I am, once again
I pour out my heart for I know that you hear
Every cry, you are listening
No matter what state my heart is in
You are faithful to answer
With words that are true and a hope that is real
As I feel your touch
You bring a freedom to all that's within
In the safety of this place
I'm longing to.
Pour out my heart to say that I love you
Pour out my heart to say that I need you
Pour out my heart to say that I'm thankful
Pour out my heart to say that you're wonderful

Pour out your spirit, Lord, on your people
Pour out your spirit, Lord, on your people
Pour out your spirit, Lord, on your people
Let it reign let it reign
Pour out your mercy, Lord, on your people
Pour out your mercy, Lord, on your people
Pour out your mercy, Lord, on your people
Let it reign let it reign
Pour out your fire, Lord, on your people
Pour out your fire, Lord, on your people
Pour out your fire, Lord, on your people
Let it reign let it reign
Turn the hearts of the fathers to their children
And every nation to the God of love and holiness
Let the fire of your spirit burn

Spirit of power, anoint me for service,
Spirit of holiness, cleanse Thou my heart;
Give to my soul of Thyself a new vision,
And a new measure of power impart.
Fill me with power for service and use me;
Is there not some work my weak hands can do?
Make me a channel of life and of blessing,
And with the Spirit anoint me anew.
Not one lost soul have I won for Thy kingdom,
All of my life has been fruitless and waste;
Others have joy for the jewels ingathered;
May not my soul of this joy have a taste?
Never before has my soul so an hungered
For Thy infilling, O Spirit of love!
Come to the throne, be my Master and Ruler,
Reign Thou and draw my affections above.
Myself I yield in complete consecration,
Body and spirit and soul to be Thine;
Spirit of power, regard Thou my yearnings,
And fill Thou me with Thy fullness divine.

There’s power in the blood to save from sin,
To bring the peace of God where guilt hath been;
A new and happy life will then begin,
There’s power in the blood of Jesus.
There’s power in the blood of Jesus,
There’s power in the blood of Jesus;
To save the soul today,
Wash every sin away,
There’s power in the blood of Jesus.
There’s power in the blood today, I see,
As when He set the palsied sinner free;
And now His saving grace extends to me,
There’s power in the blood of Jesus.
No righteousness of ours can e’er avail,
But through the Lamb of God we shall prevail;
There’s power in His blood, all else will fail,
There’s power in the blood of Jesus.
There’s power in the blood for our release,
There’s power in the blood to bring soul-peace;
The merits of His blood will not decrease,
There’s power in the blood of Jesus.

When Abraham and Sarah had promised them a son,
They were surprised and knew not what to say;
But they knew what God had promised He was able to perform:
And the pow’r of God is just the same today.
The pow’r of God is just the same today,
It doesn’t matter what the people say;
Whatever God has promised
He’s able to perform:
And the pow’r of God is just the same today.
When Moses wanted water to quench the people’s thirst,
He knew that God would then provide a way;
Although his rod was useful he had the power first:
And the pow’r of God is just the same today.
When Moses made a serpent and placed it on a pole,
The bitten ones were told to look that way,
And then while they were looking Jehovah-rophi made them whole:
And the pow’r of God is just the same today.
When Joshua was commander, he spoke—the sun stood still,
The moon its onward course was made to stay;
Thus he won a mighty battle, for he did his Father’s will:
And the pow’r of God is just the same today.
When Naaman, the leper, before Elisha stood,
He thought he knew just what the seer would say,
But he had to wash in Jordan, though he thought it wasn’t good:
And the pow’r of God is just the same today.

Lord, I come to You -- let my heart be changed, renewed 
Flowing from the grace that I've found in You.
Lord, I've come to know
The weaknesses I see in me -- will be stripped away
By the power of Your love
Hold me close, 
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near, draw me to Your side
And as I wait, I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on by the power of Your love
Lord, unveil my eyes, let me see You face to face,
The knowledge of Your love, as You live in me.
Lord, renew my mind, as Your will unfolds in my life,
In living every day by the power of Your love 

Who is like Him 
The lion and the Lamb 
Seated on the throne 
Mountains bow down 
Every ocean roars 
To the Lord of hosts 
Praise Adonai 
From the rising of the sun 
Til the end of every day 
Praise Adonai 
All the nations of the earth 
All the angels and the saints 
Sing Praise 

Praise for Thee, Lord, in Zion waits;
Prayer shall besiege Thy temple gates;
All flesh shall to Thy throne repair,
And find through Christ salvation there.
Our spirits faint; our sins prevail;
Leave not our trembling hearts to fail:
O Thou that hearest prayer, descend,
And still be found the sinner’s friend.
How blest Thy saints! how safely led!
How surely kept! how richly fed!
Savior of all in earth and sea,
How happy they who rest in Thee.
Thy hand sets fast the mighty hills,
Thy voice the troubled ocean stills;
Evening and morning hymn Thy praise,
And earthy Thou bounty wide displays.
The year is with Thy goodness crowned;
Thy clouds drop wealth the world around;
Through Thee the deserts laugh and sing,
And nature smiles and owns her King.
Lord, on our souls Thy Spirit pour;
The moral waste within restore;
O let Thy love our springtide be,
And make us all bear fruit to Thee.

Praise God for what He’s done for me!
Once I was blind, but now I see;
I on the brink of ruin fell,
Glory to God! I’m out of hell.
And above the rest this note shall swell,
This note shall swell, This note shall swell,
And above the rest this note shall swell,
My Jesus has done all things well.
The Lord has pardoned all my sin,
And now to praise Him I’ll begin;
I never praised the Lord before,
But now I’ll praise Him more and more.
I spurned His grace, I broke His laws,
But Jesus undertook my cause;
Bad as I was, He cleansed my soul,
Healed my disease, and made me whole.
Praise God for what He’s done for us!
He’s turned our hearts to praise Him thus,
And now He cries, “Go on, go on!
I’ll crown you when your work is done."

Praise God the Lord, ye sons of men,
Before His highest throne;
Today He opens Heav’n again
And gives us His own Son.
He leaves His heav’nly Father’s throne
Is born an Infant small,
And in a manger, poor and lone,
Lies in a humble stall.
He veils in flesh His power divine
A servant’s form to take;
In want and lowliness must pine
Who Heav’n and earth did make.
He nestles at His mother’s breast,
Receives her tender care,
Whom angels hail with joy most blest,
King David’s royal Heir.
’Tis He who in these latter days
From Judah’s tribe should come,
By Whom the Father would upraise
The Church, His Christendom.
A wondrous change which He does make!
He takes our flesh and blood,
And He conceals for sinners’ sake
His majesty of God.
He serves that I a lord may be;
A great exchange indeed!
Could Jesus’ love do more for me
To help me in my need?
He opens us again the door
Of paradise today;
The angel guards the gate no more
To God our thanks we pay.

Praise God, for He is kind;
His mercy lasts for aye.
Give thanks with heart and mind
To God of gods alway.
For certainly His mercies dure,
For certainly His mercies dure,
Most firm, most firm and sure eternally.
The Lord of lords praise ye,
Whose mercies still endure.
Great wonders only He
Doth work by His great pow’r.
Which God omnipotent,
By might and wisdom high,
The Heav’n and firmament
Did frame, as we may see.
To Him Who did outstretch
This earth so great and wide,
Above the waters’ reach
Making it to abide.

Praise God, ye servants of the Lord,
O praise His Name with one accord;
Bless ye the Lord, His Name adore
From this time forth forevermore,
From this time forth forevermore.
From rising unto setting sun
Praised be the Lord, the Mighty One;
He reigns o’er all, supreme in might,
Above the heavens in glory bright,
Above the heavens in glory bright.
On whom but God can we rely,
The Lord our God Who reigns on high,
Who condescends to see and know
The things of heaven and earth below,
The things of heaven and earth below?
He lifts the poor and makes them great,
With joy He fills the desolate;
Praise ye the Lord and bless His Name,
His mercy and His might proclaim,
His mercy and His might proclaim.
The barren woman feels His power
And comes to sacred motherhood,
Adorns with grace the home of man.
Sing hallelujah! God is good

Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Sing, O Earth, His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him! hail Him! highest archangels in glory;
Strength and honor give to His holy Name!
Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
In His arms He carries them all day long:
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Tell of His excellent greatness.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Ever in joyful song!
Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
For our sins He suffered, and bled, and died.
He our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,
Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.
Sound His praises! Jesus who bore our sorrows,
Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong.
Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Heav’nly portals loud with hosannas ring!
Jesus, Savior, reigneth forever and ever.
Crown Him! Crown Him! Prophet, and Priest, and King!
Christ is coming! over the world victorious,
Pow’r and glory unto the Lord belong.

Praise Him, praise Him, all ye little children,
God is love, God is love;
Praise Him, praise Him, all ye little children,
God is love, God is love.
Love Him, love Him, all ye little children,
God is love, God is love;
Love Him, love Him, all ye little children,
God is love, God is love.
Thank Him, thank Him, all ye little children,
God is love, God is love;
Thank Him, thank Him, all ye little children,
God is love, God is love.

We have come into His house and gathered in His name to worship Him
We have come into His house and gathered in His name to worship Him

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord most High
And we come to you and worship at your feet

Praise, O Sion, praise thy Maker,
Praise thy Saviour, praise thy Pastor,
In a joyous melody:
Put forth all thy strength to sing him,
For the best that thou canst bring him
Cannot ever worthy be.
Tell, O tell in praises glowing
How the living, life-bestowing
Bread from heaven is given to thee:
Bread which Christ, before he suffered,
At the sacred banquet proffered
To the Twelve in company.
Lift thy voice in tuneful ,
Joyfully strain sonorous
Be thy heart's delight outpoured;
While this solemn day we celebrate
How the Saviour first did consecrate
For his guests the mystic board.
Here, our new King's table gracing,
This new Passover's new blessing
Hath fulfilled the older rite:
Here is new to old succeeding,
Truth its shadow superseding,
Darkness swallowed up in light.
What he did at supper seated
Christ ordained to be repeated
In this memory divine;
Wherefore we, his precept heeding,
And his saving Offering pleading,
Consecrate the bread and wine.
'Tis the truth to Christians given,
Bread becomes his Flesh from heaven,
Wine becomes his holy Blood:
Here, where sight is unavailing,
Faith may seize with grasp unfailing
What can ne'er be understood.
'Neath these diverse signs are hidden
Priceless things to sense forbidden,
Outward signs are all we see:
Bread for eating, wine for drinking,
Yet, in ways beyond all thinking,
Christ in each doth deign to be.
Whoso of this feast partaketh,
Christ divideth not nor breaketh -
He is whole to all that taste:
Whether one this bread receiveth
Or a thousand, still he giveth
One same food that cannot waste.
Good and bad alike are sharing
One repast, a doom preparing
All unlike - 'tis life or death:
Each a destiny is making -
Seek ye of the one partaking
How the issue differeth!
When this Sacrament is broken,
Doubt not in each severed token.
Hallowed by the blessing spoken,
What is veiled doth whole abide:
Though the sign is broken duly,
Christ himself remaineth truly
All unbroken; present fully
Here abides the Signified.
Lo, the angels' food is given
To the pilgrim who hath striven;
See the children's Bread from heaven,
Which on dogs may ne'er be spent:
Christ the old types is fulfilling,
Isaac bound, a Victim willing,
Paschal Lamb its life-blood spilling,
Manna to the fathers sent.
O true Bread, Good Shepherd, tend us,
Jesu, of thy love befriend us,
Thou refresh us, thou defend us,
Let thy goodness here attend us
Till the land of life we see;
Thou who all things canst and knowest,
Who such food on earth bestowest,
Make us where thy face thou showest,
'Mid thy saints, through lest and lowest,
Guests and fellow heirs with thee.

Praise our Creator and Savior eternal,
Him Who redeemed us from death and the grave;
Sing of His greatness, O hail and adore Him,
Strong to deliver, and mighty to save.
Praise Him, praise Him,
Glory in the highest unto Him ascribing;
Praise Him, praise Him,
Blessed be His Name, our Lord and King!
Praise our Creator and gracious Defender,
Rock where in safety we still may abide;
He is our Shepherd, how gently He leads us,
Where in the valley the cool waters glide.
Praise our Creator, the Fountain of goodness,
Now in His grandeur exalted above;
Rest in His mercy and trust in His promise,
Ever to keep us, upheld by His love.

Praise our great and gracious Lord,
call upon his holy name;
raising hymns in glad accord,
all his mighty acts proclaim:
how he leads his chosen
unto Canaan's promised land,
how the word we have heard
firm and changeless still shall stand.
God has given the cloud by day,
given the moving fire by night;
guides his Israel on their way
from the darkness into light.
God it is who grants us
sure retreat and refuge nigh;
light of dawn leads us on:
'tis the Dayspring from on high.

Praise our Savior, in our measure,
Sound aloud His wondrous Name;
Gladly singing, praises bringing,
Heart and voice His love proclaim.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Praise, oh, praise Him in our singing.
Savior! Savior!
Hear, oh, hear our praises ringing!
Shout, shout, in notes more loud,
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Shout, shout, in notes more loud,
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Send His story, spread His glory,
To the earth’s remotest bound;
Tell the tidings—gracious tidings—
Where a sinful soul is found.
Worship, honor, strength and blessing,
Be to Him forever paid;
Love increasing, thanks unceasing,
For the life His death hath made.

Let us mingle our voices in today;
The earth is rejoicing, all nature is gay,
And the stream in the valley goes laughing along;
How happy its beautiful song.
Praise the Lord, the Giver of all,
Praise the Lord, the Giver of all;
Let His children with rapture His mercy recall,
The bountiful Giver of all.
There is joy in the sunbeam that sparkles so bright
And calls the young blossoms to welcome the light;
And the bird in the greenwood is singing with glee,
As cheerful and happy as we.
Let us join the glad music and joyfully raise,
In purest devotion, our jubilant praise;
We are grateful to God for this beautiful day:
We’ll sing the bright moments away.

When you're up against a struggle
That shatters all your dreams
And your hopes have been cruelly crushed
By Satan's manifested schemes
And you feel the urge within you
To submit to earthly fears
Don't let the faith you're standing in, seem to disappear
Praise the Lord
He can work with those who praise Him,
Praise the Lord
For our God inhabits praise,
Praise the Lord
For the chains that seem to bind you
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you
When you praise him
Now Satan is a liar
And he wants to make us think
That we are paupers
When he knows himself
We're children of the King
So lift up the mighty shield of faith
For the battle has been won
We know that Jesus Christ has risen
And the work's already done
Praise Him
Praise the Lord

Praise the LORD, all nations.
Laud Him, all peoples
for His lovingkindness is great
toward us, toward us
And the faithfulness of the LORD is everlasting
Praise the LORD, praise the LORD Halleluia!!
Thank Him for His goodness,
His truth and grace
He is our salvation
Our hope and strength

Age to age and shore to shore,
Praise him, praise him evermore!
Praise the Lord, his mercies trace;
Praise his providence and grace,
All that he for us has done,
All he sends us through his Son.
Strings and voices, hands and hearts,
In the concert play your parts;
All that breathe, your Lord adore,
Praise him, praise him evermore!

Praise the Lord of Heaven, praise Him in the height;
Praise Him, all ye angels, praise Him, stars of light;
Praise Him, skies, and waters which above the skies,
When His Word commanded, stablished did arise.
Praise the Lord, ye fountains of the deeps and seas,
Rocks and hills and mountains, cedars and all trees;
Praise Him, clouds and vapors, snow and hail and fire,
Stormy wind fulfilling only His desire.
Praise Him, fowls and cattle, princes and all kings;
Praise Him, men and maidens, all created things;
For the Name of God is excellent alone;
On the earth His footstool, over Heav’n His throne.

Praise the Lord, rise up rejoicing,
Worship, thanks, devotion voicing:
Glory be to God on high!
Christ, your cross and passion sharing,
By this Eucharist declaring
Yours the final victory.
Scattered flock, one shepherd sharing,
Lost and lonely, one voice hearing,
Ears attentive to the word;
By the blood new life receiving,
In the body, firm believing,
We are yours, and you the Lord.
Sins forgiven, wrongs forgiving,
We go forth alert and living
In your Spirit, strong and free.
Partners in your new creation,
Seeking peace in ev'ry nation,
May we faithful foll'wers be.

Praise the Lord through every nation;
His holy arm hath wrought salvation;
Exalt Him on His Father’s throne;
Praise your King, ye Christian legions,
Who now prepares in heav’nly regions
Unfailing mansions for His own;
With voice and minstrelsy
Extol His majesty: Alleluia!
His praise shall sound all nature round,
Where’er the race of man is found.
God with God dominion sharing,
And Man with man our image bearing,
Gentile and Jew to Him are given;
Praise your Savior, ransomed sinners,
Of life, through Him, immortal winners;
No longer heirs of earth, but Heaven.
O beatific light 
To view His face in light; Alleluia!
And, while we see, transformed to be
From bliss to bliss eternally.
Jesus, Lord, our Captain glorious,
O’er sin, and death, and hell victorious,
Wisdom and might to Thee belong:
We confess, proclaim, adore Thee,
We bow the knee, we fall before Thee,
Thy love henceforth shall be our song:
The cross meanwhile we bear,
The crown ere long to wear.Alleluia!
Thy reign extend world without end,
Let praise from all to Thee ascend.

Praise the Lord Who reigns above and keeps His court below;
Praise the holy God of love and all His greatness show;
Praise Him for His noble deeds; praise Him for His matchless power;
Him from Whom all good proceeds let earth and heaven adore.
Publish, spread to all around the great Jehovah’s name,
Let the trumpet’s martial sound the Lord of hosts proclaim:
Praise Him in the sacred dance, harmony’s full concert raise,
Let the virgin choir advance, and move but to His praise.
Celebrate th’eternal God with harp and psaltery,
Timbrels soft and cymbals loud in this high praise agree;
Praise with every tuneful string; all the reach of heavenly art,
All the powers of music bring, the music of the heart.
God, in Whom they move and live, let every creature sing,
Glory to their Maker give, and homage to their King.
Hallowed be Thy Name beneath, as in heaven on earth adored;
Praise the Lord in every breath, let all things praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord, each tribe and nation,
Praise Him with a joyous heart;
Ye who know His full salvation,
Gather now from every part;
Let your voices glorify,
In His temple, God on high.
He’s our God, and our Creator,
We, His flock and chosen seed:
He, our Lord and Liberator,
Us from sin and peril freed:
And at last His flock shall rest
In the mansions of the blest.
Give Him thanks within His portals;
In the courts His deeds proclaim;
Hither come, ye ransomed mortals,
Glorify our Savior’s Name.
Ever kind and loving, He
Keeps His faith eternally.

Praise the Lord, for He is good,
For His mercies ever sure
From eternity have stood,
To eternity endure.
Let His ransomed people raise
Songs to their Redeemer’s praise.
From captivity released,
From the south and from the north,
From the west and from the east,
In His love He brought them forth,
Ransomed out of every land
From the adversary’s hand.
Wandering in the wilderness,
Far they roamed the desert way,
Found not settled dwelling place
Where in peace secure to stay,
Till with thirst and hunger pressed
Courage sank within their breast.
To Jehovah then they cried
In their trouble, and He saved;
He Himself became their Guide,
Led them to the rest they craved
By a pathway straight and sure,
To a city strong, secure.
Sons of men, awake to praise
God the Lord who reigns above,
Gracious in His works and ways,
Wondrous in redeeming love;
Let them all thank offerings bring,
Celebrate His deeds and sing.

Praise the Lord, God’s glories show, Alleluia!
Saints within God’s courts below, Alleluia!
Angels round the throne above, Alleluia!
All that see and share God’s love, Alleluia!
Earth to Heaven and Heaven to earth, Alleluia!
Tell the wonders, sing God’s worth, Alleluia!
Age to age and shore to shore, Alleluia!
Praise God, praise forevermore! Alleluia!
Praise the Lord, great mercies trace, Alleluia!
Praise His providence and grace, Alleluia!
All that God for us has done, Alleluia!
All God sends us through the Son.Alleluia!
Strings and voices, hands and hearts, Alleluia!
In the concert bear your parts, Alleluia!
All that breathe, your Lord adore, Alleluia!
Praise Him, praise Him evermore!

Praise the Lord: ye heavens, adore Him;
Praise Him, angels in the height.
Sun and moon, rejoice before Him;
Praise Him, all ye stars of light.
Praise the Lord, for He hath spoken;
Worlds His mighty voice obeyed.
Laws which never shall be broken
For their guidance He hath made.
Praise the Lord, for He is glorious;
Never shall His promise fail.
God hath made His saints victorious;
Sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the God of our salvation;
Hosts on high, His power proclaim.
Heaven and earth and all creation,
Laud and magnify His Name.
Worship, honor, glory, blessing,
Lord, we offer unto Thee.
Young and old, Thy praise expressing,
In glad homage bend the knee.
All the saints in heaven adore Thee;
We would bow before Thy throne.
As Thine angels serve before Thee,
So on earth Thy will be done.

Praise the one who breaks the darkness
with a liberating light.
Praise the one who frees the prisoners,
turning blindness into sight.
Praise the one who preached the Gospel,
healing every dread disease,
calming storms and feeding thousands
with the very bread of peace.
Praise the one who blessed the children
with a strong yet gentle word.
Praise the one who drove out demons
with a piercing two-edged sword.
Praise the one who brings cool water
to the desert's burning sand.
From this well comes living water,
quenching thirst in every land.
Praise the one true love incarnate:
Christ who suffered in our place.
Jesus died and rose for many
that we may know God by grace.
Let us sing for joy and gladness,
seeing what our God has done.
Praise the one redeeming glory,
praise the One who makes us one.

Praise the Rock of our salvation!
Praise the mighty God above!
Come before His sacred presence
With a grateful song of love.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
He is God, and He alone.
Wake the song of adoration—
Come with joy before His throne!
Praise the Rock of our salvation!
Praise the Father’s boundless love!
Praise the Lamb, our expiation!
Praise the Spirit from above!
Praise the Rock of our salvation!
Jesus’ blood avails for sin;
Jesus, at the door of mercy,
Waits to let the wandr’er in.
Praise the Rock of our salvation!
Catch from yonder radiant clime
Strains by everlasting ages,
Echoed back in tones sublime.

Praise the Savior now and ever;
Praise Him, all beneath the skies;
Prostrate lying, suff’ring, dying
On the cross, a sacrifice.
Vict’ry gaining, life obtaining,
Now in glory He doth rise.
Man’s work faileth, Christ’s availeth;
He is all our righteousness;
He, our Savior, has forever
Set us free from dire distress.
Through His merit we inherit
Light and peace and happiness.
Sin’s bonds severed, we’re delivered,
Christ has bruised the serpent’s head;
Death no longer is the stronger,
Hell itself is captive led.
Christ has risen from death’s prison,
O’er the tomb He light has shed.
For His favor, praise forever,
Unto God the Father sing;
Praise the Savior, praise Him ever,
Son of God, our Lord and King.
Praise the Spirit, through Christ’s merit,
He doth us salvation bring.

Praise the Savior, all ye nations,
Praise Him, all ye hosts above;
Shout, with joyful acclamation,
His divine, victorious love;
Be His kingdom now promoted,
Let the earth her Monarch know;
Be my all to Him devoted,
To my Lord my all I owe.
See how beauteous on the mountains
Are their feet, whose grand design
Is to guide us to the fountains
That o’erflow with bliss divine,
Who proclaim the joyful tidings
Of salvation all around,
Disregard the world’s deridings,
And in works of love abound.
With my substance will I honor
My Redeemer and my Lord;
Were ten thousand worlds my manor,
All were nothing to His Word:
While the heralds of salvation
His abounding grace proclaim,
Let His friends, of every station,
Gladly join to spread His fame.

Praise the Savior, ye who know Him!
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
All we are and have.
Jesus is the Name that charms us,
He for conflict fits and arms us;
Nothing moves and nothing harms us
While we trust in Him.
Trust in Him, ye saints, forever,
He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever
Those He loves from Him.
Keep us, Lord, O keep us cleaving
To Thyself, and still believing,
Till the hour of receiving
Promised joys with Thee.
Then we shall be where we would be,
Then we shall be what we should be,
Things that are not now, nor could be,
Soon shall be our own.

Praise thou the Lord, O my soul, sing praises,
Praise Him from morn till fall of night.
While o’er my life His strong arm He raises,
I shall sing thanks to God, my Light.
Who life and soul hath given me,
Be magnified eternally.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Sing, all ye nations, exalt the glory
Of Him Whose arm doth valiantly
All that hath life and breath, tell the story
In accent strong, with voices free.
Ye servants of the Triune God,
Father and Son and Spirit laud!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

An al­ter­nate trans­la­tion, by C.G.Haas, 1897:
Praise thou the Lord, O my soul, now praise Him,
His praise continue until death;
While I the pathways of earth am treading
God shall be praised with every breath.
My soul and body He did give,
And waits my praise from morn till eve.
O praise the Lord, O praise the Lord!
Happy, yea, happy are they forever,
Whose help the God of Jacob is,
Who hath created the earth and heaven,
The sea and all that therein is.
Let all the world His praises sing,
Who life and health to all doth bring.
O praise the Lord, O praise the Lord!
If there are any who are oppressed,
He worketh justice in the tide;
Food for the hungry, forlorn, distressed,
The Lord in season doth provide;
Those bound in chains He maketh free,
His lovingkindness they shall see,
O praise the Lord, O praise the Lord!
Praise, O ye people, the Name most glorious
Of Him Who reigns Almighty King.
Let all unite in one holy 
To God our hymns of joy to bring.
O Zion, with the heavenly host,
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
O praise the Lord, O praise the Lord!

Praise to God Who reigns above,
Binding earth and Heav’n in love;
All the armies of the sky
Worship His dread sovereignty.
Seraphim His praises sing,
Cherubim on fourfold wing,
Thrones, dominions, princes, powers,
Marshaled might that never cowers.
Speeds th’archangel from His face,
Bearing messages of grace;
Angel hosts His words fulfill,
Ruling nature by His will.
Yet on man they joy to wait,
All that bright celestial state,
For in man their Lord they see,
Christ, th’incarnate Deity.
On the throne their Lord Who died
Sits in manhood glorified;
Where His people faint below
Angels count it joy to go.
Oh, the depths of joy divine,
Thrilling through those orders nine,
When the lost are found again,
When the banished come to reign!
Now in faith, in hope, in love,
We will join the choirs above,
Praising, with the heav’nly host,
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

Praise to God, immortal praise,
For the love that crowns our days;
Bounteous Source of every joy,
Let Thy praise our tongues employ.
Flocks that whiten all the plain;
Yellow sheaves of ripened grain;
Clouds that drop their fattening dews,
Suns that temperate warmth diffuse.
All that Spring with bounteous hand
Scatters o’er the smiling land;
All that liberal Autumn pours
From her rich o’erflowing stores.
These to Thee, my God, we owe,
Source whence all our blessings flow;
And for these my soul shall raise
Grateful vows and solemn praise.
Yet, should rising whirlwinds tear
From its stem the ripening ear;
Should the fig tree’s blasted shoot
Drop her green untimely fruit,
Should the vine put forth no more,
Nor the olive yield her store;
Though the sickening flocks should fall,
And the herds desert the stall,
Yet to Thee my soul shall raise
Grateful vows and solemn praise;
And, when every blessing’s flown
Love Thee for Thyself alone.

Praise to our God, Whose bounteous hand
Prepared of old our glorious land;
A garden fenced with silver sea;
A people prosperous, strong, and free.
Praise to our God; through all our past
His mighty arm hath held us fast;
Till wars and perils, toils and tears,
Have brought the rich and peaceful years.
Praise to our God; the vine He set
Within our coasts is fruitful yet;
On many a shore her offshoots grow;
’Neath many a sun her clusters glow.
Praise to our God; His power alone
Can keep unmoved our ancient throne,
Sustained by counsels wise and just,
And guarded by a people’s trust.
Praise to our God; Who still forbears
Who still this sinful nation spares,
Who calls us still to seek His face,
And lengthens out our day of grace.
Praise to our God; through chastenings stern
Our evil dross should thoroughly burn,
His rod and staff, from age to age,
Shall rule and guide His heritage!

Praise to the Heavenly Wisdom
Who knows the hearts of all—
The saintly life’s beginnings,
The traitor’s secret fall;
Our own ascended Master,
Who heard His Church’s cry,
Made known His guiding presence,
And ruled her from on high.
Elect in His foreknowledge,
To fill the lost one’s place;
He formed His chosen vessel
By hidden gifts of grace;
Then, by the lot’s disposing,
He lifted up the poor,
And set him with the princes
On high for evermore.
For on the golden breastplate
Of our great Priest above,
Twelve are the stones that glisten
And throbs that Heart of Love;
And twelve the fair foundations
Of Salem’s jasper wall;
And twelve the thrones predestined
Within her judgment hall.
No mystic gem is lacking
In that divine array;
No empty throne shall darken
The glory of that day;
For lo! on twelve the Spirit,
The Father’s Promise, came;
And twelve went forth together
To preach the saving Name.
Still guide Thy Church, Chief Shepherd,
Her losses still renew;
Be Thy dread keys entrusted
To faithful hands and true;
Apostles of Thy choosing
May all her rulers be,
That each with joy may render
His last account to Thee!

Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.
O loving wisdom of our God!
When all was sin and shame,
A second Adam to the fight
And to the rescue came.
O wisest love! that flesh and blood,
Which did in Adam fail,
Should strive afresh against the foe,
Should strive and should prevail.
And that a higher gift than grace
Should flesh and blood refine,
God’s Presence and His very Self,
And Essence all divine.
O generous love! that He, Who smote,
In Man for man the foe,
The double agony in Man
For man should undergo.
And in the garden secretly,
And on the Cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and inspire
To suffer and to die.
Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.

Praise to the living God!
All praised be His Name,
Who was, and is, and is to be,
And still the same!
The one eternal God,
Ere aught that now appears;
The first, the last: beyond all thought
His timeless years!
His Spirit floweth free,
High surging where it will;
In prophet’s word He spoke of old;
He speaketh still.
Established is His law,
And changeless it shall stand,
Deep writ upon the human heart,
On sea or land.
He hath eternal life
Implanted in the soul;
His love shall be our strength and stay,
While ages roll.
Praise to the living God!
All praised be His Name,
Who was, and is, and is to be,
And still the same.

All praised be His Name,
Who was, and is, and is to be,
And still the same.

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear, now to His temple draw near;
Praise Him in glad adoration.
Praise to the Lord, Who over all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen how thy desires ever have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?
Praise to the Lord, Who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;
Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.
What need or grief ever hath failed of relief?
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.
Praise to the Lord, Who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do,
If with His love He befriend thee.
Praise to the Lord, Who, when tempests their warfare are waging,
Who, when the elements madly around thee are raging,
Biddeth them cease, turneth their fury to peace,
Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.
Praise to the Lord, Who, when darkness of sin is abounding,
Who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,
Sheddeth His light, chaseth the horrors of night,
Saints with His mercy surrounding.
Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him.
Let the Amen sound from His people again,
Gladly for aye we adore Him.

Praise waits for Thee in Zion; all tribes shall worship there
And pay their vows before Thee, O God Who hearest prayer.
Our sins rise up against us, prevailing day by day,
But Thou wilt show us mercy and take their guilt away.
How blest the ones Thou callest and bringest near to Thee,
That in Thy courts forever their dwelling place may be;
They shall within Thy temple be satisfied with grace,
And filled with all the goodness of Thy most holy place.
O God of our salvation, since Thou dost love the right,
Thou wilt an answer send us in wondrous deeds of might.
In all earth’s habitations, on all the boundless sea,
We find no sure reliance, no peace, apart from Thee.
Thy might sets fast the mountains; strength girds Thee evermore
To calm the raging peoples and still the ocean’s roar.
Thy majesty and greatness are through all lands confessed,
And joy on earth Thou sendest afar from east to west.

Praise we the Lord this day,
This day so long foretold,
Whose promise shone with cheering ray
On waiting saints of old.
The prophet gave the sign
For faithful men to read;
A virgin born of David’s line
Shall bear the promised seed.
Ask not how this should be,
But worship and adore,
Like her whom Heav’n’s Majesty
Came down to shadow o’er.
She meekly bowed her head
To hear the gracious word,
Mary, the pure and lowly maid,
The favored of the Lord.
Blessed shall be her name
In all the Church on earth,
Through whom that wondrous mercy came,
The incarnate Savior’s birth.
Jesus, the virgin’s Son,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with God the Father One
And Spirit evermore.

Praise ye Jehovah, praise the Lord most holy,
Who cheers the contrite, girds with strength the weak;
Praise Him Who will with glory crown the lowly,
And with salvation beautify the meek.
Praise Him for His constant care,
His ever present love;
Praise Him, for He hears our prayer,
And answers from above.
Praise God the Father, praise the ever blessed Son,
Praise God the Spirit, praise the Three in One.
Praise ye the Lord for all His loving kindness,
And all the tender mercies He hath shown;
Praise Him Who pardons all our sin and blindness,
And calls us sons, and takes us for His own.
Praise ye Jehovah! source of every blessing—
Before His gifts earth’s richest boons are dim;
Resting in Him, His peace and joy possessing,
All things are ours, for we have all in Him.
Praise ye the Father! God the Lord Who gave us,
With full and perfect love His only Son;
Praise ye the Son Who died Himself to save us!
Praise ye the Spirit! praise the Three in One!

Praise ye Jehovah! praise the Lord most holy,
Who cheers the contrite, girds with strength the weak!
Praise Him Who will with glory crown the lowly,
And with salvation beautify the meek.
Praise ye Jehovah! for His lovingkindness,
And all the tender mercy He hath shown;
Praise Him Who pardons all our sin and blindness,
And calls us sons, and takes us for His own.
Praise ye Jehovah! source of all our blessings:
Before His gifts earth’s richest boons wax dim;
Resting in Him, His peace and joy possessing,
All things are ours, for we have all in Him.
Praise ye the Father! God, the Lord, Who gave us,
With full and perfect love, His only Son;
Praise ye the Son! Who died Himself to save us;
Praise ye the Spirit! praise the Three in One!

Praise ye the Lord, the hope of our salvation;
Praise ye the Lord, our soul’s abiding trust;
Great are His works and wonderful His counsels;
Praise ye the Lord, the only wise and just.
Praise ye the Lord, our Strength and our Redeemer,
Praise ye the Lord, His mighty love recall,
Tell how He came from bondage to deliver,
Tell how He came to purchase life for all.
Praise ye the Lord, for good it is to praise Him;
O let the earth His majesty proclaim;
Shout, shout for joy and bow the knee before Him;
Sing to the harp and magnify His Name.
Praise ye the Lord, Whose throne is everlasting;
Praise ye the Lord, Whose gifts are ever new;
Praise ye the Lord, Whose tender mercy falleth
Pure as the rain and gentle as the dew.
Praise ye the Lord, oh, glory hallelujah!
Praise ye the Lord, Whose kingdom has no end;
Praise ye the Lord, Who watcheth o’er the faithful,
Praise ye the Lord, our never changing Friend.

Praise we the Lord this day,
This day so long foretold,
Whose promise shone with cheering ray
On waiting saints of old.
The prophet gave the sign
For faithful men to read:
A Virgin, born of David's line,
Shall bear the promised Seed.
Ask not how this should be,
But worship and adore;
Like her, whom heaven's majesty
Came down to shadow o'er.
Meekly she bowed her head
To hear the gracious word,
Mary, the pure and lowly maid,
The favoured of the Lord.
Blessed shall be her name
In all the Church on earth,
Through whom that wondrous mercy came,
The incarnate Saviour's birth.
Jesu, the Virgin's Son,
We praise thee and adore,
Who art with God the Father One
And Spirit evermore.

Praise ye the Lord! immortal choir,
In heavenly heights above,
With harp and voice and souls of fire,
Burning with perfect love.
Shine to His glory, worlds of light!
Ye million suns of space,
Fair moons and glittering stars of night,
Running your mystic race!
Ye gorgeous clouds, that deck the sky
With crystal, crimson, gold,
And rainbow arches raised on high,
The Light of light unfold!
Lift to Jehovah, wintry main,
Your grand white hands in prayer;
Still summer seas, in dulcet strain,
Murmur hosannas there!
Do homage, breezy ocean floor,
With many-twinkling sign;
Majestic calms, be hushed before
The Holiness Divine.
Storm, lightning, thunder, hail and snow,
Wild winds that keep His word,
With the old mountains far below,
Unite to bless the Lord.
His Name, ye forests, wave along;
Whisper it, every flower;
Birds, beasts, and insects, swell the song
That tells His love and power.
Around the wide world let it roll,
Whilst man shall lead it on;
Join every ransomed human soul,
In glorious unison!
Come, aged man! come, little child!
Youth, maiden, peasant, king,
To God in Jesus reconciled
Your hallelujahs bring!
The all creating Deity,
Maker of earth and Heav’n!
The great redeeming Majesty,
To Him the praise be giv’n!

Praise ye the Lord, my heart shall join
In work so pleasant, so divine;
Now, while the flesh is mine abode,
And when my soul ascends to God.
Praise shall employ my noblest powers,
While immortality endures;
My days of praise shall ne’er be past,
While life, and thought, and being last.
Why should I make a man my trust?
Princes must die and turn to dust;
Their breath departs, their pomp, and power,
And thoughts, all vanish in an hour.
Happy the man whose hopes rely
On Israel’s God; He made the sky,
And earth, and seas, with all their train,
And none shall find His promise vain.
His truth forever stands secure;
He saves th’ oppressed, He feeds the poor;
He sends the laboring conscience peace,
And grants the prisoner sweet release.
The Lord hath eyes to give the blind;
The Lord supports the sinking mind;
He helps the stranger in distress,
The widow and the fatherless.
He loves his saints, He knows them well,
But turns the wicked down to hell:
Thy God, O Zion! ever reigns;
Praise Him in everlasting strains.

Praise ye the Lord! on every height
Songs to His glory raise;
Ye angel hosts, ye stars of night,
Join in immortal praise.
O heaven of heavens, let praise far swelling
From all thine orbs be sent:
Join in the strains, ye waters, dwelling
Above the firmament.
For His the Word which gave you birth,
And majesty and might;
Praise to the Highest from the earth,
And let the deeps unite.
O fire and vapor, hail and snow,
Ye servants of His will;
O stormy winds, that only blow
His mandates to fulfill.
Mountains and rocks, to Heaven that rise;
Fair cedars of the wood;
Creatures of life that wing the skies,
Or track the plains for food;
Judges of nations; kings whose hand
Waves the proud scepter high;
O youths and virgins of the land,
O age and infancy.
Praise ye His Name, to Whom alone
All homage should be given,
Whose glory from the eternal throne
Spreads wide o’er earth and Heaven.

Praise ye the Lord, the hope of our salvation;
Praise ye the Lord, our soul’s abiding trust;
Great are His works and wonderful His counsels;
Praise ye the Lord, the only wise and just.
Praise ye the Lord, our Strength and our Redeemer,
Praise ye the Lord, His mighty love recall,
Tell how He came from bondage to deliver,
Tell how He came to purchase life for all.
Praise ye the Lord, for good it is to praise Him;
O let the earth His majesty proclaim;
Shout, shout for joy and bow the knee before Him;
Sing to the harp and magnify His Name.
Praise ye the Lord, Whose throne is everlasting;
Praise ye the Lord, Whose gifts are ever new;
Praise ye the Lord, Whose tender mercy falleth
Pure as the rain and gentle as the dew.
Praise ye the Lord, oh, glory hallelujah!
Praise ye the Lord, Whose kingdom has no end;
Praise ye the Lord, Who watcheth o’er the faithful,
Praise ye the Lord, our never changing Friend.

Praise ye the Lord, exalt His Name,
While in His holy courts ye wait,
Ye saints, that to His house belong,
Or stand attending at His gate.
Praise ye the Lord, the Lord is good;
To praise His Name is sweet employ:
Israel He chose of old, and still
His church is His peculiar joy.
The Lord himself will judge His saints;
He treats His servants as His friends;
And when He hears their sore complaints,
Repents the sorrows that He sends.
Through every age the Lord declares
His Name, and breaks th’ oppressor’s rod
He gives His suffering servants rest,
And will be known th’ Almighty God.
Bless ye the Lord, who taste His love,
People and priest, exalt His Name:
Amongst His saints He ever dwells;
His church is His Jerusalem.

Praise ye the Lord, for He is good;
Give thanks and bless His Name;
His lovingkindness changes not,
From age to age the same.
What tongue can tell His mighty deeds,
His wondrous works and ways?
O who can show His glory forth,
Or utter all His praise?
The Lord will bless and prosper those,
Yea, blest indeed are they
Whose ways are just, who constantly
His righteous law obey.
O Lord, remember me in grace,
Let me salvation see;
The grace Thou showest to Thy saints,
That grace reveal to me.
Let me behold Thy people’s good
And in their joy rejoice;
With Thy triumphant heritage
Let me lift up my voice.
In evil we have gone astray,
And sinful is our race;
Rebelliously our fathers walked,
Forgetful of Thy grace.
Though they rebelled, yet for their help
In saving strength He came
To make His power almighty known
And glorify His Name.
He brought them safely through the sea
And overwhelmed their foes;
Their faith was stirred, and for the time
Their songs of praise arose.
Forgetful soon, they tempted God
Nor for His counsel cared;
He sent them leanness in their souls,
While they earth’s bounties shared.
With envy they regarded those
Whom God to them had sent;
The opening earth, the kindling flame,
Brought awful punishment.
A golden image they adored,
And worshipped at its shrine;
Thus they despised the living God,
And scorned His love divine.
Their God and Savior they forgot,
Their Helper and their Stay,
But Moses pled the promised grace
And turned God’s wrath away.
Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
The promised land of God,
And tempted Him to make them fall
And scatter them abroad.
They sacrificed to heathen gods,
And God their sin repaid;
Then holy wrath avenged the wrong,
And so the plague was stayed.
The Lord approved the righteous act
Of him who sin abhorred,
And honored him forevermore
With just and great reward.
By wicked strife they angered God,
His wrath they did provoke;
And stirred by their rebellious cries,
Their leader rashly spoke.
Ensnared, they served the heathen gods,
And by them were beguiled;
The blood of children sacrificed
The very land defiled.
Against His own inheritance
Jehovah’s wrath arose,
His chosen people He condemned
To serve their heathen foes.
Though from their harsh oppressors’ hand
Ofttimes He set them free,
Rebellious still, they were brought low
In their iniquity.
When unto God they cried, He heard
And turned again His face,
In boundless love remembering
The covenant of His grace.
He even touched their captors’ hearts,
And made their very foes
Compassionate and pitiful
To feel His people’s woes.
Save us, O Lord, our gracious God,
From alien lands reclaim,
That we may triumph in Thy praise
And bless Thy holy Name.
Blest be the Lord our covenant God,
All praise to Him accord;
Let all the people say, “Amen."
Praise ye, praise ye the Lord.

Praise ye the Lord; ’tis good to raise
Our hearts and voices in His praise;
His nature and His works invite
To make this duty our delight.
The Lord builds up Jerusalem,
And gathers nations to His Name;
His mercy melts the stubborn soul,
And makes the broken spirit whole.
He formed the stars, those heav’nly flames;
He counts their numbers, calls their names;
His wisdom’s vast, and knows no bound,
A deep where all our thoughts are drowned.
Great is our Lord, and great His might;
And all His glories infinite:
He crowns the meek, rewards the just,
And treads the wicked to the dust.
Sing to the Lord, exalt Him high,
Who spreads His clouds all round the sky;
There He prepares the fruitful rain,
Nor lets the drops descend in vain.
He makes the grass the hills adorn,
And clothes the smiling fields with corn;
The beasts with food His hands supply,
And the young ravens when they cry.
What is the creature’s skill or force,
The sprightly man, the warlike horse,
The nimble wit, the active limb?
All are too mean delights for Him.
But saints are lovely in His sight,
He views His children with delight;
He sees their hope, He knows their fear,
And looks, and loves His image there.

Praise ye the Father for His lovingkindness;
Tenderly cares He for His erring children;
Praise Him, ye angels, praise Him in the heavens,
Praise ye Jehovah!
Praise ye the Savior—great is His compassion;
Graciously cares He for His chosen people;
Young men and maidens, older folks and children,
Praise ye the Savior!
Praise ye the Spirit, Comforter of Israel,
Sent of the Father and the Son to bless us;
Praise ye the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
Praise ye the Triune God!

Praise ye, praise ye the Lord in yonder heav'nly height;
Ye angels, all His hosts, in joyful praise unite;
O sun and moon, declare His might,
Show forth His praise, ye stars of light.
Praise Him, ye highest heav'ns, praise Him, ye clouds that roll,
Created by His pow池 and under His control,
Ye heav'ns that stand eternally,
Established by His firm decree.
Ye creatures in the sea and creatures on the earth,
Your mighty Maker praise and tell His matchless worth;
Praise Him, ye stormy winds that blow,
Ye fire and hail, ye rain and snow.
Ye hills and mountains, praise, each tree and beast and bird;
Ye kings and realms of earth, now let your praise be heard;
By high and low, by young and old
Be all His praise and glory told.
By all let God be praised, for He alone is great;
Above the earth and Heav'n He reigns in glorious state;
Praise Him ye saints, who know His grace
And ever dwell before His face.

Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven;
To His feet thy tribute bring.
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Evermore His praises sing:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.
Praise Him for His grace and favor
To our fathers in distress.
Praise Him still the same as ever,
Slow to chide, and swift to bless.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Glorious in His faithfulness.
Fatherlike He tends and spares us;
Well our feeble frame He knows.
In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Widely yet His mercy flows.
Frail as summer’s flower we flourish,
Blows the wind and it is gone;
But while mortals rise and perish
Our God lives unchanging on,
Praise Him, Praise Him, Hallelujah
Praise the High Eternal One!
Angels, help us to adore Him;
Ye behold Him face to face;
Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
Dwellers all in time and space.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise with us the God of grace.

Praise, my soul, the Lord in glory
For His boundless grace!
For His Word, the sacred story,
That His love conveys!
I its truth embrace.
Christ has all my sins forgiven,
Peace and light bestowed.
He thro’ sin and death was driven,
And made way to God.
He made way to God.
None can justly now me censure,
Christ me chose for bride.
To His loving heart I venture,
Hiding at His side;
At His loving side.
Now, my heart, be full of gladness,
Sing with joyful sound!
Let your cheer subdue all sadness;
May your joy abound;
Let your joy resound!
When our Bridegroom comes from glory
We no joy will miss!
All the saved He’ll give, as dowry,
His eternal bliss;
Yes, eternal bliss!

Praise, O praise our God and King;
Hymns of adoration sing;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Praise Him that He made the sun
Day by day his course to run;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.
And the silver moon by night,
Shining with her gentle light;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Praise Him that He gave the rain
To mature the swelling grain;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.
And hath bid the fruitful field
Crops of precious increase yield;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Praise Him for our harvest store,
He hath filled the garner floor;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.
And for richer food than this,
Pledge of everlasting bliss;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Glory to our bounteous King;
Glory let creation sing;
Glory to the Father, Son,
And blest Spirit, Three in One.

On the desert mountain straying,
Far, far from home,
Heard I there a sweet voice, saying,
“Why wilt Thou roam?"
’Twas my blessed Lord that sought me,
Out of sin to grace He brought me,
Oh the glad, new song He taught me,
Praise, praise His Name.
At a throne of mercy kneeling,
Sad and oppressed,
Came that voice, to me revealing
Hope, life and rest.
Oft I heard that voice repeating,
“I am the Way.
Tarry not, the hours are fleeting,
Come, come today."
When from glory unto glory
My flight shall be,
Still I’ll sing the precious story,
Savior, of Thee.

Praises ev'rywhere sweetly sound,
Joy victorious here is found,
Raise the melody, let it ring,
Worship the Heav'nly King.
Praises, ev'rywhere we are singing,
Sweet notes ringing, gladness bringing,
Songs from loving hearts ever springing,
Praises to our Lord and King.
Praises ev'rywhere, let use raise,
Songs of gratitude, all our days,
O'er the universe, banners fling,
Standards of Christ the King.
Praises, ev'rywhere we are singing,
Sweet notes ringing, gladness bringing,
Songs from loving hearts ever springing,
Praises to our Lord and King.
Praises ev'rywhere, He shall hear,
Christ the conqueror we'll revere,
Love Him, honor Him, gladly sing,
Praise to the children's King.
Praises, ev'rywhere we are singing,
Sweet notes ringing, gladness bringing,
Songs from loving hearts ever springing,
Praises to our Lord and King.

God and Father of our Saviour,
Praise for glories of Thy grace.
Ev'ry blessing purposed favor,
Granted in Thy Son's embrace.
God and Father, we would bless Thee;
Help us praise Thee in this place.
Hallelujah, blessed Father,
Praises for Thy glorious grace.
Chosen sinners, long predestined,
To be holy, blameless still,
Made Thy sons by love unfathomed.
Oh, the kindness of Thy will.
Thine own Son, love's dear Redeemer,
Ransom's price His precious blood;
Sins forgiven for the treasure
Of that ageless, cleansing flood.
Myst'ry of eternal wisdom,
Thy good pleasure now made known;
Heav'n and earth's entire creation
Bent beneath Thy Son's bright throne.
Thou, intent Thine heirs to make us,
Workest all things to this will,
That those hoping first in Jesus
Might with praise the heavens fill.
Bless Thee for Thy promised Spirit,
Holy Spirit, Christians' seal;
Pledge we shall in Christ inherit
What redemption shall reveal! 

The praises of that saint we sing,
To whom all lands their tribute bring,
Who with indomitable heart,
Bore throughout life true woman’s heart.
Restraining every froward sense
By gentle bonds of abstinence,
With prayer her hungry souls she fed,
And thus to heavenly joys hath sped.
King Christ, from Whom all virtue springs,
Who only doest wondrous things,
As now to Thee she kneels in prayer,
In mercy our petitions hear.
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee;
Whom with the Spirit we adore
Forever and forevermore.

The praises of Thy wonders, Lord,
The heavens shall express;
And in the congregation
Of saints Thy faithfulness.
Thou hast an arm that’s full of power;
Thy hand is great in might;
And Thy right hand exceedingly
Exalted is in height.
Justice and judgment of Thy throne
Are made the dwelling place;
Mercy, accompanied with truth,
Shall go before Thy face.
O greatly blest the people are
The joyful sound that know;
In brightness of Thy face, O Lord,
They ever on shall go.
Because the glory of their strength
Doth only stand in Thee;
And in Thy favor shall our horn
And power exalted be.
For God is our defense; and He
To us doth safety bring;
The Holy One of Israel
Is our almighty King.

Praisin' the Lord comes from the heart
Singin' to Him is only the start
It's not the piano or David's harp
Praisin' the Lord comes from the heart 
You've got to praise the Lord
You've got to sing it to Him; praise the Lord
Do you know my Jesus; praise the Lord
Come on and sing it with me; praise the Lord 
Raise your holy hands; let the heavens ring
Listen my brother, there's one more thing
The melodies are sweet, to Christ our King
But you've got to praise Him, when you sing 
Open your soul and let it all pour
Open your heart He'll open the door
We're just one people praisin' their Lord
So we can sing it, on the other shore 
Praise (praise) the Lord 
You've got to sing it with the spirit and understanding
Got to praise Him with your heart
Sing it with the spirit and understanding
Got to praise Him with your heart 
You've got to sing it with the spirit and understanding
Got to praise Him with your heart
Sing it with the spirit and understanding
Got to praise Him with your heart

Praising Jesus as we walk along
Praising Jesus as we sing this song
Praising Jesus as we lift a load
On this heavy traveled road
It doesn’t matter day or night
I can call His name (I can call His name)
All I know is He loves me so
And that is why He came
When I’m down and I need a friend
No one can be found (no one can be found)
I know one who is always there
He’s never let me down
If you do not know this man
I’m the one to call (I’m the one to call)
We can learn about His love
It’s written down for all (it's written down for all)
On this heavy traveled road (we'll help you lift your load)
On this heavy traveled road

You came into my life for unexpected reasons
I’ve been praying for a wife to be with me one day
Sometimes there are struggles through life’s many changes
But with God we’ll find our way
Will you pray for me?
I will pray for you
That he’ll take our hands and guide us through
Will you be a part of me?
I will be a part of you
As long as we put Him first in whatever we do
My prayers have been answered, as you stand here in this place
Every day my love grows deeper; you can see it on my face
He can change our lives forever, if we listen to what He’ll say
As we join our lives today
You have filled the void within me
And brought new meaning into my life
I trust in God completely
To choose you as my wife
Will you always love me? 
I will always love you
As long as we put Him first in whatever we do

Pray for the Church, afflicted and oppressed,
for all who suffer for the gospel's sake,
that Christ may show us how to serve them best
in that one kingdom Satan cannot shake.
But how much more than us they have to give,
who by their dying show us how to live.
Pray for Christ's dissidents, who daily wait,
as Jesus waited in the olive grove,
the unjust trial, the pre-determined fate,
the world's contempt for reconciling love.
Shall all they won for us, at such a cost,
be by our negligence or weakness lost?
Pray that if times of testing should lay bare
what sort we are, who call ourselves his own,
we may be counted worthy then to wear,
with quiet fortitude, Christ's only crown:
The crown that in his saints he wears again
the crown of thorns that signifies his reign.

Everybody gathered where the river runs wider at the edge of town
To see if that Eddie Lee Vaughn baptism was really gonna go down
Folks bet hard earned money that water wouldn’t change a thing
They set the odds at a hundred to one his soul would never come clean
Then the preacher said people take a moment or two
There’s somethin’ we need to do
Pray for the fish
They won’t know what’s comin’ when the sin starts rollin’ off the likes of him
Lord be with ’em they ain’t done nothin’
Please won’t you leave ’em just a little bit of room to swim
Pray for the fish
Well the preacher ducked him under that cool clear water then he did it again
Eddie came up yellin’ ‘Lord in heaven hallelujah I’m a brand new man’
Well the water got to bubblin’, sky got to rumblin’, and the thunder backed up 
the choir
Fish started jumpin’ it was like they were swimmin’ in a lake of fire
Then Eddie’s momma stepped out of the crowd and started yellin’ out loud
He said everybody cross your fingers fold your hands
Pray for old Eddie, but before we say Amen
Pray for the fish
Lord be with ’em they ain’t done nothin’
Please won’t you leave ’em just a little bit of room to swim
Pray for the fish
Lord, pray for the fish

Pray on, pray on, O trusting heart,
Let not thy courage fail;
But take thy Savior at His word,
And know thou shalt prevail.
Tho’ the cross is hard to bear,
There is balm in secret prayer;
Go and tell thy sorrows there,
And leave it all with Jesus.
What tho’ thy prayers thro’ many tears
May reach His throne on high;
He knows the anguish of thy heart,
And will not pass thee by.
Perhaps in some desponding hour,
When hope has well nigh past,
The light will burst upon thy soul,
And joy be thine at last.
Pray on, pray on, O weary not,
Whate’er thy trial be;
But lean thy faith on Him Who said,
“It shall be well with thee."

Pray that Jerusalem may have
Peace and felicity:
Let them that love thee and thy peace
Have still prosperity.
Therefore I wish that peace may still
Within thy walls remain,
And ever may thy palaces
Prosperity retain.
Now, for my friends and brethren’s sake,
Peace be in thee, I’ll say;
And for the house of God our Lord
I’ll seek thy good alway.

Pray when the morning is breaking,
pray when the noon is bright,
pray with the eve's declining,
pray in the hush of night:
with mind made pure of passion,
all meaner thoughts away,
low in thy chamber kneeling
do thou in secret pray.
Remember all who love thee,
all who are loved by thee,
and next for those that hate thee
pray thou, is such there be:
last for thyself in meekness
a blessing humbly claim,
and link with each petition
thy great Redeemer's name.
But if 'tis e'er denied thee
in solitude to pray,
should holy thoughts come o'er thee
upon life's crowded way,
e'en then the silent breathing
that lifts thy soul above
shall reach the throned presence
of mercy, truth and love.

Praise we the Lord this day,
This day so long foretold,
Whose promise shone with cheering ray
On waiting saints of old.
The prophet gave the sign
For faithful men to read:
A Virgin, born of David's line,
Shall bear the promised Seed.
Ask not how this should be,
But worship and adore;
Like her, whom heaven's majesty
Came down to shadow o'er.
Meekly she bowed her head
To hear the gracious word,
Mary, the pure and lowly maid,
The favoured of the Lord.
Blessed shall be her name
In all the Church on earth,
Through whom that wondrous mercy came,
The incarnate Saviour's birth.
Jesu, the Virgin's Son,
We praise thee and adore,
Who art with God the Father One
And Spirit evermore.

Pray, pray, when things go wrong,
And gloomy fears around you throng;
The loving God your voice will hear,
Look up to Him, He’s always near.
Pray, pray though your eyes grow dim,
Go with your troubles straight to Him;
Pray, pray, for God understands;
Have faith, leaving all in His dear hands.
Pray, pray, be calm and still,
Whatever comes must be His will;
His promises like buds unfold,
Naught that is good will He withhold.
Pray, pray till faith grows strong,
And in your heart rings Heaven’s song;
Till self shall die in pure desire,
And every thought to Him aspire.

O, Creator of the cosmos, we present our hearts in prayer.
We are awestruck by your glory, which surrounds us everywhere.
From the birdsong of the morning to a stormy sky at night,
You reveal yourself in Nature, in its gentleness and might.
Through each rainbow that you send us you renew your covenant
With the earth and all life on it, telling us of your intent
That each living thing should flourish, in its own way, in its place.
You call us to new awareness of our neighbors and their space.
In our eagerness to prosper, we have ravaged what was good.
Using more than what was needed, taking everything we could.
We have changed the gentle order you intended for the earth.
Now we humbly ask the wisdom to be part of its re-birth.
We seek mercy, we seek vision, and the courage we will need
As we work to help the victims of the sins of human greed.
By our choices, in our actions, may we be part of your plans.
Help us gently till the Garden you’ve entrusted to our hands.
Finding strength in common purpose, may your faithful people be
Voices for a new perspective, leaders in simplicity.
Give us guidance, O, Creator.Give us power to achieve
True compassion for Creation as the legacy we leave.

When we pray to our Father up in heaven above
He looks down in tender mercy and love
He assures us He is with us though our path my oft be hard
You see its prayer that has brought us this far
There are times when we are lonely, there are times when we are blue
There are times when we question our Lord
But we all must remember that we're just passing through
And that it's prayer that has brought us this far
Yes we all must remember that we're just passing through
And that it's prayer that has brought us this far

When we pray to our Father up in heaven above
He looks down in tender mercy and love
He assures us He is with us though our path my oft be hard
You see its prayer that has brought us this far
There are times when we are lonely, there are times when we are blue
There are times when we question our Lord
But we all must remember that we're just passing through
And that it's prayer that has brought us this far
Yes we all must remember that we're just passing through
And that it's prayer that has brought us this far

Prayer is appointed to convey
The blessings God designs to give:
Long as they live should Christians pray;
They learn to pray when first they live.
If pain afflict, or wrongs oppress;
If cares distract, or fears dismay;
If guilt deject, if sin distress;
In every case, still watch and pray.
’Tis prayer supports the soul that’s weak;
Though thought be broken, language lame,
Pray, if thou canst or canst not speak;
But pray with faith in Jesus’ name.
Depend on Him; thou canst not fail;
Make all thy wants and wishes known;
Fear not; His merits must prevail:
Ask but in faith, it shall be done.

Prayer is the key for the bending knee
To open the morn’s first hours;
See the incense rise to the starry skies,
Like perfume from the flow’rs.
Not a soul so sad, nor a heart so glad
When cometh the shades of night,
But the daybreak song will the joy prolong,
And some darkness turn to light.
Take the golden key in your hand and see,
As the night-tide drifts away,
How its blessed hold is a crown of gold,
Thro’ the weary hours of day.
When the shadows fall, and the vesper call
Is sobbing its low ,
’Tis a garland sweet to the toil-dent feet,
And an antidote for pain.
Soon our toils will cease, and will come release;
Life’s tears shall be wiped away,
As the pearl gates swing, and the gold harps ring,
And we enter eternal day.

Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire,
Unuttered or expressed;
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.
Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear
The upward glancing of an eye,
When none but God is near.
Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
Prayer, the sublimest strains
That reach The Majesty on high.
Prayer is the Christian’s vital breath,
The Christian’s native air,
His watchword at the gates of death;
He enters Heav’n with prayer.
Prayer is the contrite sinner’s voice,
Returning from his ways,
While angels in their songs rejoice
And cry, “Behold, he prays!"
The saints in prayer appear as one
In word, in deed, and mind,
While with the Father and the Son
Sweet fellowship they find.
No prayer is made by man alone
The Holy Spirit pleads,
And Jesus, on th’eternal throne,
For sinners intercedes.
O Thou by Whom we come to God,
The Life, the Truth, the Way,
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod:
Lord, teach us how to pray.

Teacher
Little eyes, looking wise,
Have you said your morning prayer?
Have you thought, as you ought,
Of our heavenly Father’s care?
Tell me what our prayer should be
When the morning light we see.
All
Pleasant light, clear and bright,
Shining on the world today.
So may love from above
Shine along our upward way;
So let everything we see
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.
All
Water clear, standing near,
Wash our hands and faces clean.
May the Lord, by His Word,
Wash our hearts from every sin.
So let everything we see
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.
Girls
Cloak and hood, new and good,
Made to keep our bodies warm.
Words of truth, learned in youth,
Keep our souls from every harm.
So let everything we see
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.
Boys
Boot or shoe, old or new,
Let us keep them clean and neat;
Let us pray that we may
Some day walk the golden street;
So let everything we see
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.
Girls
Collar white, ribbons bright,
Apron, bonnet, shawl or dress;
So may we ever be
Clad in Jesus’ righteousness;
So let everything we see
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.
Boys
Top or ball, treasures all,
Books and toys I dearly prize;
Yet may I, when I die,
To my heavenly treasures rise;
So let everything we see
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.
All
Night or day, work or play,
In our hearts may be a prayer;
God can see if there be,
Well He knows what thoughts are there;
So let everything we see
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.

You will always know I'm praying for you
Tonight you feel like the world's coming in on you
No one can understand what you're going through
But I want you to know that wherever you are
Somewhere in the world I'm praying for you
And I'm praying that He'll lead you (He'll lead you) right where you need to be 
(lead you where you are)
And I'm praying He'll guide you through the storm (through the storm)
And while I'm on my knees I'll be lifting you in prayer
I hope wherever you are you're praying for me
I wish I could be right there to comfort you now
Lord knows I would if could somehow (I could somehow)
So I sing this song for you and where ever you go (you will know)
You will always know I'm praying for you
And if my time should come before I've time to show (how could I show)
What you've meant to me on earth I still want you to know
Even though I can't be seen, there's something I can do
With the Lord in Heaven we're all praying for you
I know where ever I am I'll be praying for you

Preach the Gospel, sound it forth,
Tell of free and full salvation;
Spread the tidings o’er the earth,
Go to every tribe and nation.
Spread the joyful tidings
In anthem and story
Jesus hath redeemed us,
Oh, give Him the glory!
Preach the Gospel, full of joy,
While on grace and mercy dwelling;
Heart and soul in full employ,
As the story you are telling.
Preach the Gospel, make it clear,
By the blood of Christ remission;
Give the message, make them hear,
This alone is our commission.
Preach the Gospel full of love,
Christ’s compassion fully knowing;
Seek the power from above,
While His great compassion showing.
Preach the Gospel as if God
Sinners lost through you were seeking;
His salvation through the Word
Speak as if the Lord were speaking.

Precious angel, under the sun,
How was I to know you'd be the one
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon? 
Now there's spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down.
Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
()
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself.
I'm a little too blind to see.
()
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell.
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "All is well."
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw.
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law.
You were telling him about Buddha you were telling him about Mohammed in the
same breath.
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal's death.
(
()
Precious angel, you believe me when I say
What God has given to us no man can take away.
We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you touch up the night.
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ.

O precious Bible! burning words from heaven,
We’ll ever cherish thee in our heart;
Sweet is the counsel by thy pages given:
On life’s dark ocean, our only chart.
Blessed Bible! Blessed Bible!
Joyful tidings from our home;
Thou art the rock of everlasting ages;
Hope of eternal bliss at heaven’s throne.
O precious volume! only in thy pages
We read the duty of all our race;
Only thy sunbeams, shining through the ages,
Reveal the wonders of saving grace.
This book of heaven shall endure forever;
And from its wisdom we’ll never turn;
Weighed in its balance, all the creeds that sever
Are only stubble, ere long to burn.
Dear book of mercy, on thy sure foundation
We build a dwelling-place for our soul;
Hearing and doing all thy revelation,
It stands unshaken, though billows roll.

Precious Bible! what a treasure
Does the Word of God afford?
All I want for life or pleasure,
Food and med’cine, shield and sword:
Let the world account me poor,
Having this I need no more.
Food to which the world’s a stranger,
Here my hungry soul enjoys;
Of excess there is no danger,
Though it fills, it never cloys:
On a dying Christ I feed,
He is meat and drink indeed.
When my faith is faint and sickly,
Or when Satan wounds my mind,
Cordials, to revive me quickly,
Healing med’cines here I find:
To the promises I flee,
Each affords a remedy.
In the hour of dark temptation
Satan cannot make me yield;
For the Word of consolation
Is to me a mighty shield
While the scripture truths are sure,
From his malice I’m secure.
Vain his threats to overcome me,
When I take the Spirits’ sword;
Then with ease I drive him from me.
Satan trembles at the word:
’Tis a sword for conquest made,
Keen the edge, and strong the blade.
Shall I envy then the miser
Doting on his golden store?
Sure I am, or should be, wiser,
I am rich, ’tis he is poor:
Jesus gives me in his word,
Food and med’cine, shield and sword.

Precious Child, so sweetly sleeping
In a virgin’s fond embrace;
Heav’nly hosts their watch are keeping
O’er Thy humble dwelling place;
Blest Messiah, newborn King,
Let my heart its tribute bring.
Anthems joyous now are ringing
In the skies of Bethlehem;
Angels their sweet song are singing,
“Peace on earth, good will to men."
Precious Jesus, at Thy birth
Heaven’s peace is brought to earth.
Sweetly rest, Thou promised Savior,
By the prophets long foretold;
Brightly beams the Father’s favor,
Now all men His love behold.
Virgin born Immanuel,
Let my tongue Thy praises tell!
Promised Savior, I adore Thee,
Son of David, Son of God!
What can mortals bring before Thee?
All is Thine on earthly sod.
Take my heart and let it be
Filled with love, dear Child, to Thee.

I was straying when Christ found me
In the night so dark and cold;
Tenderly His arm went round me,
And He bore me to His fold.
Precious hiding place,
Precious hiding place,
In the shelter of His love;
Not a doubt or fear,
Since my Lord is near,
And I’m sheltered in His love.
With His nail-scarred hand He bro’t me
To the shelter of His love;
Of His grace and will He taught me,
And of heav’nly rest above.
Tho’ the night be dark around me,
I am safe, for He is near;
Never shall my foes confound me,
While the Savior’s voice I hear.

Sweet rest in Jesus,
Home of the soul,
Growing more precious,
While ages shall roll.
Home, home,
Home for all the blest;
Home, home,
Precious home of rest.
Sweet rest in Jesus,
While here we stay;
And He’s prepared us
A home far away.
Sweet rest in Jesus,
Home in the skies—
It must be glorious,
Where man never dies.
Sweet rest in Jesus,
There to abide,
Ever victorious,
Where naught can betide.

Precious Jesus, Lord of all
I come before you, and I humbly fall
I want to know you more than anything
I want to love you with my everything
'Cause I've been touched by your saving love
Become lost in your amazing grace
And my heart is overwhelmed at the beauty of your ways
And here and now I stand, and say I'm forever yours
Jesus you're my all in all
And I will sing your praise
And even now as I come
Broken before you
You touch my heart, you move my lips
To adore you

Hear the story from God's Word
that Kings and priests and prophets heard;
There would be a sacrifice
and blood would flow to pay sin's price.
Precious Lamb of Glory,
Loves' most wondrous story,
Heart of God's redemption of man.
Worship the Lamb of Glory.
On the cross God loved the world,
While all the powers of hell were hurled.
No one there could understand
The one they saw was Christ, the Lamb.
Precious Lamb of Glory,
Loves' most wondrous story,
Heart of God's redemption of man.
Glory to the Lamb, pure as snow I stand,
Worshiping the Lamb of Glory.
With the saints, I will stand in eternity,
Giving thanks to the Lamb of Glory.
Precious Lamb of Glory,
Loves' most wondrous story,
Heart of God's redemption of man.
Glory to the Lamb, pure as snow I stand,
Worshiping the Lamb of Glory.

Precious Lord, be my guide, through the (Am) day, through the night,
Always with me, here beside me, precious Lord, be my guide.
(Am) I feel your touch in the gentle summer breezes
Brushing by my face, you fill my life with light and love.
The (Am) growing buds of spring-time and the seasons of creation
Sing your love each day, every day.
I hear your voice in the laughter of a baby,
Your promise that creation will have another day.
The aged face tells me of wisdom gained through years of living
In your love each day, every day.
I see your face in my brothers and my sisters,
Perfect in your image, your love flows through them each day.
Each one I meet’s a blessing sweet
And makes me want to love them more and more each day, every day.
Precious Lamb of Glory,
Loves' most wondrous story,
Heart of God's redemption of man.
Glory to the Lamb, pure as snow I stand,
Worshiping the Lamb of Glory.
With the saints, I will stand in eternity,
Giving thanks to the Lamb of Glory.

Precious Lord, take my hand,
Lead me on, let me stand,
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn;
Through the storm, through the night,
Lead me on to the light:
Take my hand, precious Lord,
Lead me home.
When my way grows drear,
Precious Lord, linger near,
When my life is almost gone,
Hear my cry, hear my call,
Hold my hand lest I fall:
When the darkness appears
And the night draws near,
And the day is past and gone,
At the river I stand,
Guide my feet, hold my hand:

Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred past unfold
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home's scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear

O the precious, precious moments
That we spend before the throne,
And to Jesus, our Redeemer,
Make our wants and wishes known.
O the peace that like a river
From the mount of blessing flows;
How it calms the weary spirit
To a gentle, soft repose!
O the precious, precious moments,
When a loving voice we hear,
In a whisper, low and tender,
Breathing words of happy cheer.
O the precious, precious moments,
When the eye of faith shall see
Visions of eternal glory,
Endless raptures yet to be.
There’s a balm for every trial,
And a rest from every care,
There’s a joy for every sorrow,
At the golden gate of prayer.

Take the Name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe,
It will joy and comfort give you;
Take it then, where弾r you go.
Precious Name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heav'n.
Precious Name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heav'n.
Take the Name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy Name in prayer.
O the precious Name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ!
At the Name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in Heav'n we'll crown Him,
When our journey is complete.

Precious, precious blood of Jesus
Shed on Calvary;
Shed for rebels, shed for sinners,
Shed for thee!
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Everflowing free;
O believe it; O receive it,
'Tis for thee.
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Let it make thee whole;
Let it flow in mighty cleansing
O'er thy soul.
Though thy sins are red like crimson,
Deep in scarlet glow,
Jesus' precious blood shall wash thee
White as snow.
Precious blood that hath redeemed us!
All the price is paid;
Perfect pardon now is offered;
Peace is made.
Precious blood! by this we conquer
In the fiercest fight,
Sin and Satan overcoming
By its might.
Precious blood, whose full atonement
Makes us nigh to God!
Precious blood, our

Precious promise God has given
To the weary passerby,
On the way from earth to Heaven,
的 will guide thee with Mine eye."
I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
I will guide thee with Mine eye
On the way from earth to Heaven,
I will guide thee with Mine eye.
When temptations almost win thee
And thy trusted watchers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee,
的 will guide thee with Mine eye."
When thy secret hopes have perished
In the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherished,
的 will guide thee with Mine eye."
When the shades of life are falling
And the hour has come to die,
Hear thy trusty Pilot calling,
的 will guide thee with Mine eye."
way to glory,
Praise and laud! 

O the joy while thus we meet,
Learning here at Jesus’ feet
Words of truth that point the way
To realms of day!
Precious words of worth untold,
Ever new but never old,
May we read them o’er and o’er,
And love them more.
Words that tell of Him Who came
In His Father’s blessed name;
And the angels at His birth
Sang “Peace on earth";
Words that tell His love to men,
How He died and rose again,
To provide a mansion fair
That we might share.
Words that kindly say to all,
While their tones like music fall,
“Come to Jesus while you may;
He calls today";
If our heart we open wide,
He will then with us abide;
We may dwell with Him above,
Where all is love.

Prepare me, gracious God,
To stand before thy face;
Thy Spirit must the work perform,
For it is all of grace.
In Christ's obedience clothe,
And wash me in his blood;
So shall I lift my head with joy
Among the sons of God.
Do thou my sins subdue,
Thy sov'reign love make known;
The spirit of my mind renew,
And save me in thy Son.
Le me attest thy pow'r.
Let me thy goodness prove,
Till my full soul can hold no more
Of everlasting love.

Prepare the way, O Zion!
Ye awful deeps, rise high;
Sink low, ye towering mountains,
The Lord is drawing nigh;
The righteous King of glory,
Foretold in sacred story.
O blest is He that came
In God the Father’s Name.
O Zion, He approacheth,
Thy Lord and King for aye!
Strew palms where He advanceth,
Spread garments in His way.
God’s promise faileth never,
Hosanna sound forever!
Fling wide thy portals, Zion
And hail thy glorious King;
His tidings of salvation
To every people bring,
Who, waiting yet in sadness,
Would sing His praise in gladness.
He cometh not with warriors,
And not with pomp and show,
Yet smiteth He with terror
Sin, death, and every foe.
The Spirit’s sword He wieldeth,
Not e’en to death He yieldeth.
Give heed, thou sinful people,
Thy King and Savior own;
The kingdom He hath founded
Is not an earthly one;
No power can overthrow it,
Nor earthly wisdom know it.
The throne which He ascendeth
Is fixed in heaven above:
His sanctified dominion
Is light alone and love.
His praise be ever sounding
For grace and peace abounding.
Jerusalem is fallen,
And closed its temple door;
Its sacrifices ended;
Its scepter is no more.
Christ’s kingdom never ceaseth,
Its glory still increaseth.

Careless soul, why will you linger,
Wand’ring from the fold of God?
Hear you not the invitation?
Oh, prepare to meet thy God.
Careless soul, oh, heed the warning,
For your life will soon be gone;
Oh, how sad to face the judgment,
Unprepared to meet thy God.
Why so thoughtless are you standing,
While the fleeting years go by,
And your life is spent in folly?
Oh, prepare to meet thy God.
Hear you not the earnest pleadings
Of your friends that wish you well?
And perhaps before tomorrow
You’ll be called to meet your God.
If you spurn the invitation
Till the Spirit shall depart,
Then you’ll see your sad condition,
Unprepared to meet thy God.

Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King)
Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King) (He's a Mighty King)
Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King) (my Master is a mighty, mighty, 
mighty, Mighty King)
Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King)
Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King) (Don't you believe that He's a Mighty 
King, tell me brothers)
Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King) (He's a mighty, mighty, mighty, 
Mighty King)
Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King) (He's a mighty King)
Oh what a Mighty King (what a Mighty King)

Preserve me, Lord, in time of need;
For succor to Thy throne I flee,
But have no merits there to plead:
My goodness cannot reach to Thee.
Oft have my heart and tongue confessed
How empty and how poor I am;
My praise can never make Thee blessed,
Nor add new glories to Thy Name.
Yet, Lord, Thy saints on earth may reap
Some profit by the good we do;
These are the company I keep,
These are the choicest friends I know.
Let others choose the songs of mirth
To give a relish to their wine;
I love the men of heav’nly birth,
Whose thoughts and language are divine.

Press on, my brother, sister,
And face the deadly foe;
Through Jesus Christ we’ll conquer,
While trav’ling here below.
Press on, press on,
Says Christ, our loving Friend;
Press on, press on,
“I’m with thee to the end." 
Press on, and let thy failings
A blessing to thee prove;
No wave of care or sorrow
Thy trusting soul shall move.
Press on, though raging tempests
And fiery billows roll;
While crossing life’s rough rapids,
He’ll safely guide thy soul.
Press on, ’mid strong temptation,
Tell Satan he must flee;
In Jesus’ name resist him,
And vict’ry thine shall be.
Press on, forever trusting,
In faith believing, too;
In spite of doubt or feeling,
God’s word will take you through.
Press on to what’s before us,
Forgetting all the past;
The light of heav’n so glorious
Eternally shall last.

When I’m passing through the furnace,
He won’t forsake me there;
He has promised to protect me,
And my burdens He will share.
Press on, my soul, to glory,
My journey won’t be long;
Through trials and tribulations
Is the way He calls us home.
Then why should I be fearful
While the raging storms winds blow;
If I trust in God Almighty,
Then the pow’rs of hell must go.
Press on, my soul, to glory,
My courage is renewed;
The devil stands defeated,
And I’m feasting on heav’nly food.

Press on, press on, ye workers,
Be loyal, brave and true:
Great things the Lord is doing,
And greater things will do;
His army, still increasing
With each revolving year,
Shall send a sound of rapture forth
That all the world shall hear.
Rejoice, rejoice, ye workers all, rejoice!
O clap your hands and sing,
O clap your hands and sing!
God’s holy Church shall triumph yet,
Triumph yet, triumph yet,
And He shall reign our King,
Shall reign our King.
The walls of leagued oppression
To dust shall fall away;
The sword of truth eternal,
No pow’r on earth can stay;
Tho’ all the hosts of darkness
Were marshaled on the field,
The Church of God would stand unmoved,
With Christ her strength and shield.
Behold her marching onward,
In majesty sublime,
Along the rolling prairies
That bound our western clime;
And soon from every hamlet
On all our vast frontier
Glad songs shall rise to Jesus,
While the skeptics turn to hear.

Press onward, press onward, and trusting the Lord,
Remember the promise proclaimed in His Word;
He guideth the footsteps, directeth the way
Of all who confess Him, believe, and obey.
Believe and obey, believe and obey;
The Master is calling, no longer delay:
The light of His mercy shines bright on the way
Of all who confess Him, believe, and obey.
Press onward, press onward, if you would secure
The rest of the faithful, abiding and sure;
The gift of salvation is offered today
To all who confess Him, believe, and obey.
Press onward, press onward, your courage renew;
The prize is before you, the crown is in view;
His love is so boundless, He’ll never say nay
To those who confess Him, believe, and obey.

Forward, forward, is the battle cry,
Onward, onward, to our home on high;
We will conquer for the Lord or die,
The foe’s retreating, press the battle on.
Strengthened by the mighty pow’r of heaven,
We shall conquer, we shall conquer;
Till the raging foe afar is driven,
Press the battle on.
Forward, forward, never faint or fear,
Christ, our Captain, is forever near;
Be courageous, full of hope and cheer,
With full assurance press the battle on.
Forward, forward, put the foe to flight,
We are battling for the truth and right;
We shall triumph in Jehovah’s might,
Then do not falter, press the battle on.
Forward, forward, there’s a crown before,
See it shining on that heav’nly shore?
We shall wear it when the conflict’s o’er,
The prize is waiting, press the battle on.

Jesus, priceless treasure,
source of purest pleasure.
Truest friend to me,
truest friend to me.
Though the earth be shaking,
every heart be quaking,
God dispels our fear,
God dispels our fear.
Those who love the Father,
though the storms may gather,
still have peace within,
still have peace within.

Prime time, when time is no more
There's a time where we're going, we've been knowing
After all of these years (all these years)
When the music we're making, will have taken
Away all these tears
In that heavenly place, there'll be a smile on the face
Of everyone (everyone)
There'll be a big celebration, sweet jubilation
There with the Son
No time to lose or be out of time
Everything there will be prime
I'm waiting for the prime time
Moving to the other shore
We're heading for the prime time
Singing there forevermore
There'll be nothing like the prime time
That's what we've been living for
Prime time
When time is no more
There's a home destination, a sweet adoration
Of the Lord on His throne (On His throne)
Where the pain turns to laughter, happy thereafter
And we're never alone
In that place full of light, secure in all that is right
And ever will be (ever be)
There'll be no stress and no sorrow, a joyful tomorrow
And fully set free
No time to waste or to be out of line
He's making everything prime
Wherever He is, I know that life will be fine (it will be fine)
'Cause He's made a place (He's made a place)
Not second best, it will be prime
I'm waiting for the prime time (heading for the prime time)
Moving to the other shore (moving to the other shore)
I'm heading for the prime time (prime time)
Singing there forevermore
There'll be nothing like the prime time (we've been living for the prime time)
That's what we've been living for (living for)
Prime time (prime time, prime time)
When time is no more
I'm waiting for the prime time (prime time, prime time)
When time is no more

Prince of Peace, control my will;
Bid the struggling heart be still;
Bid my fears and doubtings cease,
Hush my spirit into peace.
Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,
Opened wide the gate to God;
Peace I ask, but peace must be,
Lord, in being one with Thee.
May Thy will, not mine, be done;
May Thy will and mine be one;
Chase these doubtings from my heart,
Now Thy perfect peace impart.
Savior, at Thy feet I fall,
Thou my life, my God, my all;
Let Thy happy servant be
One forevermore with Thee!

I belong to Him (Him, Him, Him)
I'm a prisoner of God
Bound by choice and not by chains
The day I heard His voice
Was the day my life began
He took away my sin, my sorrow, and my burden
I'm a prisoner of God
I belong to Him
Sometimes my feet get weary, sometimes the path gets rough (My feet get weary, 
the path is rough)
God's made it clear to me that His love is enough (God's made it clear, love is 
enough)
He came into my broken heart, I'll never be the same (Into my heart, I'm not the 
same)
I'll follow after Him, I'll gladly wear His name (I'll follow Him, I'll gladly 
wear His name)
As I look back on my life, I see what He's done (As I look back, see what He's 
done)
The time He saved myself and the victories He's won (He's saved my soul, the 
victories won)
Grace the burden for my sin, love my prison cell (Grace for my sin, His love my 
cell)
He opened up this heart of mine, He saved my soul from hell (He opened my heart, 
He saved my soul from hell)
I'd walked in darkness for so long
My light was growing dim
Whether I live or die
It doesn't matter, I belong to Him
I belong to Him
I belong to Him (Him, Him, Him, Him)

Prisoners of hope, arise, and see your Lord appear;
Lo! on the wings of love He flies, and brings redemption near;
Redemption in His blood He calls you to receive:
“Look unto Me, the pardoning God.Believe," He cries, “believe!"
The reconciling word, we thankfully embrace;
Rejoice in our redeeming Lord, a blood besprinkled race.
We yield to be set free; Thy counsel we approve;
Salvation, praise, ascribe to Thee, and glory in Thy love.
Jesus, to Thee we look, till saved from sin’s remains;
Reject the inbred tyrant’s yoke, and cast away his chains.
Our nature shall no more over us dominion have;
By faith we apprehend the power which shall forever save

Time to run the race
Now we realize
There's no turning back
Time to win the prize
Pressing on towards the mark
Light the flame with one small spark 
Run the race, stay the course
Aiming for the goal
That's beyond what you see here
Keep the faith, hold it high
Don't you be confused by a world of hate and fear
Since you know deep within
That the love you want
Can be yours if you persevere
Overcome all the doubt
That can cloud your mind
And you'll find it's very clear (clear) 
Though the pace is fast
And the journey's long
Though the heart be faint
We will carry on
Breathing hard, we bear the pain
Counting all our loss as gain 
We will not give up
'Til the race is won
We won't fall away
Now that we've begun
No reward that we can hold
Striving for a crown of gold

Father I have sinned, help me find my way,
Remember not my sins, just let me hear You say
I forgive you, I love you.You are mine, take my hand
Go in peace, sin no more, beloved one.
Father I have turned, my back and walked away
Depended on my strength, and loved life my own way
Father I have closed, my heart to those in need
Thought only of myself, a victim of my greed
Father I’ve returned, I’m home with You to stay
Standing by your door, knowing that You’ll say

When you were young, heart filled with faith
You trusted in all that was good
But somewhere along the way
You ventured away from the truth
The sin in your heart left you empty
Yes sin has its wages to pay
Your friends had forsaken and left you
Yet a voice could be heard far away.
Prodigal Son.He's waiting for you
Don't be afraid to come home
Prodigal Son.with arms open wide
Come feel His love deep inside of you (of you, of you, of you)
Slowly your thoughts turn to home
Fond memories of where you once were
And on your knees you cry "Father"
"Please let me come home just to serve
I've been far away and so lonely
Been broken continuously
Oh my Lord don't disown me"
The father says so lovingly.
Prodigal Son.I'm waiting for you
Don't be afraid to come home
Prodigal Son.with arms open wide
Come feel my love deep inside of you (of you, of you, of you)

Here is a question up to all on the earth,
Time will unfold to young and old,
What will your profit or your fortune be worth,
To gain all this world, then lose your soul? 
What will be your profit,
To gain all this world, then lose your soul?
What will be your profit,
To gain all this world, then lose you soul? 
What will become of all your fortune and land,
Silver and gold, riches untold;
When you have made it all your purpose and aim
To gain all this world, then lose your soul? 
To buy a soul what would you give in exchange?
Sum up the whole, within your control;
If it were possible, would you not arrange
To give all this world and save your soul? 
Stop just a moment now and count up the cost,
Look, and behold your fearful goal;
Surrender now to Him that hung on the cross,
Suffered and died to save your soul.
When you are lying helpless, speechless, and dumb,
Sad to behold, life’s story told;
When you like other dying mortals must come
To leave all this word a helpless soul.

O Lord, Your Word is eternal,
Standing firm in the heavens above;
Your faithfulness shall continue,
It's Your promise of love,
O Lord, Your Word will sustain me,
Day by day, O Giver of Life;
I will delight in Your promise,
Your promise of love.
Only Your Word 
Brings healing to the hurting,
Only Your Word 
Brings light into the night;
Only Your Word 
Will satisfy my hunger,
Only Your Word, O Lord,
It's Your promise of love

Summoned home, the call has sounded,
Bidding a soldier his warfare cease;
And the song of angels resounded,
Welcomes a warrior to eternal peace.
Praise the Lord! from earthly struggles
A comrade has found release.
Death has lost its sting, the grave its victory;
Conflicts and dangers are over;
See him honored in the throne of glory,
Crowned by the hand of Jehovah!
Strife and sorrow over,
The Lord’s true faithful soldier
Has been called to go from the ranks below,
To the conq’ring host above.
Once the sword, but now the scepter,
Once the fight, now the rest and fame,
Broken every earthly fetter,
Now the glory for the cross and shame;
Once the loss of all for Jesus,
But now the eternal gain.
Trials and sorrow here have found their meaning
Mysteries their explanation;
Safe, forever in the sunlight gleaming
Of His eternal salvation.

’Twas sung by the poets, foreseen in the spirit,
A time of refreshing is near;
When creeds and divisions would fall to demerit,
And saints in sweet union appear.
Oh, glory to Jesus! we hail the bright day,
And high on our banner salvation display,
The mists of confusion are passing away.
We stand in the glory that Jesus has given,
The moon, as the dayspring doth shine;
The light of the sun is now equal to seven,
So bright is the glory divine.
Now filled with the Spirit and clad in the armor
Of light and omnipotent truth;
We’ll testify ever, and Jesus we’ll honor
And stand from sin Babel aloof.
The prophet’s keen vision, transpiercing the ages,
Beheld us to Zion return;
We’ll sing of our freedom, though Babylon rages,
We’ll shout as her city doth burn.
The fig tree is budding, the “evening" is shining,
We welcome the wonderful light!
We look for the Savior, for time is declining,
Eternity’s looming in sight! 

Prostrate, dear Jesus, at Thy feet,
A guilty rebel lies;
And upwards to Thy mercy seat,
Presumes to lift his eyes.
If tears of sorrow would suffice
To pay the debt I owe,
Tears should from both my weeping eyes
In ceaseless torrents flow.
But no such sacrifice I plead
To expiate my guilt;
No tears but those which Thou hast shed
No blood, but Thou hast spilt.
Think of Thy sorrows, dearest Lord,
And all my sins forgive:
Justice will well approve the word
That bids the sinner live.

Protect and save me, O my God,
From foes that seek my life,
And set me high, secure, above
The rising tide of strife.
The workers of iniquity
Against me lie in wait;
Though I am innocent, O Lord,
They gather in their hate.
Behold their wickedness, O Lord,
To help me, O awake;
Lord God of hosts, Thou, Israel’s God,
Arise, and vengeance take.
My enemies with deadly rage
Renew their fierce attack;
They think the Lord will not regard,
But Thou wilt turn them back.
O God, my Strength, on Thee I wait,
To Thee for refuge flee;
My God with mercy will defend,
Triumphant I shall be.
O God, our Shield, let wickedness
And pride be put to shame,
Till all shall know that Thou dost rule
And all shall fear Thy Name.
Let wickedness that raged in power
Now rage in impotence;
But I will glory in Thy strength,
My Refuge and Defense.
When all the night of woe is past
And morning dawns at length,
Then I shall praise Thy grace, O God,
My Refuge and my Strength.
To Thee, O God most merciful,
My thankful song I raise;
My Might, my strong, secure Abode,
I will proclaim Thy praise.

O Protector of my soul,
You will stand against the foe.
In the dark, You’ll be a light for me,
O Protector of my soul.
You who created the ends of the earth,
Guided me unto Your throne,
Offered Your healing hand to me,
Mercifully made me Your own.
O Holy Spirit, come;
Show the world where life comes from.
May they always see You alive in me;
O Holy Spirit, come.

I will praise, I will praise
You oh Lord, you oh Lord
With all my heart, with all my heart
I will tell, I will tell
Of your wonders, of your wonders
I'll be glad and exult in thee
I'll be glad and exult in thee
I will sing praise to your name oh most high
I will sing praise to your name (2x)

May the words of my mouth
And the me-di-ta-tions of my heart
Be pleasing to You, pleasing to You.
May the words of my mouth
And the me-di-ta-tions of my heart
Be pleasing to You, my God.
You're my Rock and my Re-deem-er,
You're the reason that I sing.
I desire to be a blessing in Your eyes.
Every hour, every moment,
Lord, I want to be Your servant;
I desire to be a blessing
In Your eyes, in Your eyes.

As the hart longs for flowing streams
So longs my soul for You O God
My soul does thirst for the living God
When shall I come to see Your face?
My tears have fed me day and night
while men have said "Where is your God?"
But I recall as my soul pours dry
The days of praise within Your house
Why do I mourn and toil within
When it is mine to hope in God?
I shall again sing praise to Him
He is my help, He is my God

Let the name of the Lord be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised
Right now
Let the name of the Lord be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised
Right now and forevermore
Right now and forevermore
From the rising of the sun
To the place where it goes down
The name of the Lord is to be praised (x4)
The name of the Lord is to be praised
The name of the Lord is to be praised
The name of the Lord is to be praised
The name of the Lord is to be praised

When the Lord brought back the captive ones of Zion
We were like those who dream
Our mouths were filled with laughter
Our tongues with joyful shouting
They say among the nations, "the Lord has done great things for them"
And the Lord has done great things for us (2x)
We are filled with joy, we are filled with joy
You have done great things
BRIDGE:
You've restored our hearts like streams that flow
Those who've sowed in tears have reaped their joy
And returned with shouts and songs
Carrying the fruit of God


Spirit of power, anoint me for service,
Spirit of holiness, cleanse Thou my heart;
Give to my soul of Thyself a new vision,
And a new measure of power impart.
Fill me with power for service and use me;
Is there not some work my weak hands can do?
Make me a channel of life and of blessing,
And with the Spirit anoint me anew.
Not one lost soul have I won for Thy kingdom,
All of my life has been fruitless and waste;
Others have joy for the jewels ingathered;
May not my soul of this joy have a taste?
Never before has my soul so an hungered
For Thy infilling, O Spirit of love!
Come to the throne, be my Master and Ruler,
Reign Thou and draw my affections above.
Myself I yield in complete consecration,
Body and spirit and soul to be Thine;
Spirit of power, regard Thou my yearnings,
And fill Thou me with Thy fullness divine.
PSALM OF THE VALLEY 
OPEQUON CHURCH 

Light in the darkness, sailor, day is at hand!
See o’er the foaming billows fair haven’s land,
Drear was the voyage, sailor, now almost o’er,
Safe within the life boat, sailor, pull for the shore.
Pull for the shore, sailor, pull for the shore!
Heed not the rolling waves, but bend to the oar;
Safe in the life boat, sailor, cling to self no more!
Leave the poor old stranded wreck, and pull for the shore.
Trust in the life boat, sailor, all else will fail,
Stronger the surges dash and fiercer the gale,
Heed not the stormy winds, though loudly they roar;
Watch the “bright and morning Star," and pull for the shore!
Bright gleams the morning, sailor, uplift the eye;
Clouds and darkness disappearing, glory is nigh!
Safe in the life boat, sailor, sing evermore;
“Glory, glory, hallelujah!" pull for the shore.

You give Your grace to the humble,
Oppose the proud, defend the weak;
So I come as one who has stumbled,
A broken jar, to be poured out at Your feet
And You bring Your gentle reminders,
That softer hearts find greater gain;
So I cry for oil from heaven, 
To fall as long, as hard as rain on my heart
Give me a pure heart, one that is faithful,
A pure heart, one without pride,
A pure heart, search me and try me,
A pure heart I desire
Give me a pure heart, one that sees Jesus,
A pure heart, one without guile,
A pure heart, search me and try me,
A pure heart I desire

Consider it pure joy
When you face trials, trials of many kinds (joy, joy)
Consider it pure joy
Know that the tests of your faith
Can make you steadfast, patient and wise (joy, joy)
Perseverance must finish its work (joy, joy)
That you may be complete
Not lacking anything
Consider it pure joy
When you face the many trials of life (joy, joy) 
Trials of life (joy, joy) 
Blessed is the man
Who endures trials again and again
When he has stood the test
He will receive the best
The crown of life which God has promised 
To those who love Him
Be patient as you wait for God's return
Like the farmer waits for rain
For his harvest to confirm
Take courage and persevere
For the coming of our Lord is near 
Pure joy (joy, joy) 
As an example of suffering and patience
Look at the prophets who spoke in God's name
We know how happy they were
Because they stayed true to God
Even though they suffered great pain
Job is an example of steadfast trust
Bringin' joy in God's master plan
The Lord is tender and merciful (merciful)
Compassionate to all men 
Consider it pure joy
Consider it pure joy
Consider it pure joy
Consider it pure joy
Consider it pure joy 
When you're feelin' lonely
When your heart is way down
When your friends forsake you
And you feel alone 
When you face the many trials of life, pure joy (joy, joy) 
Consider it pure joy

Lord, on Thee my strength relies,
O, hear me when I call;
Up to Thee I lift mine eyes,
My Life, my Help, my All.
Source of comfort, Spring of grace,
Cleanse my heart from every sin,
Now reveal Thy smiling face,
And make me pure within.
Rock on which my soul would rest,
From storm and tempest wild,
Gently pillowed on Thy breast,
Protect Thy weary child.
Let Thy Spirit be my Guide,
To endless joys above;
Grant I may never turn aside,
Or once forget Thy love.
Soon my bark will speed its flight,
To yonder portals fair,
Soon’t will reach the haven bright,
And drop its anchor there.

Purer in heart, O God, help me to be;
May I devote my life wholly to Thee:
Watch Thou my wayward feet,
Guide me with counsel sweet;
Purer in heart, help me to be.
Purer in heart, O God, help me to be;
Teach me to do Thy will most lovingly;
Be Thou my Friend and Guide,
Let me with Thee abide;
Purer in heart, help me to be.
Purer in heart, O God, help me to be;
Until Thy holy face one day I see:
Keep me from secret sin,
Reign Thou my soul within;
Purer in heart, help me to be.

Purer yet and purer, I would be in mind,
Dearer yet and dearer, every duty find;
Hoping still, and trusting God without a fear,
Patiently believing He will make all clear.
Calmer yet and calmer, in the hour of pain,
Surer yet and surer, peace at last to gain;
Suffering still and doing, to His will resigned,
And to joy subduing heart and will and mind.
Higher yet and higher, out of clouds and sight,
Nearer yet and nearer, rising to the Light;
Light serene and holy, where my soul may rest,
Purified and holy, sanctified and blessed.
Swifter yet and swifter, ever onward run,
Firmer yet and firmer, step as I go on;
Oft these earnest longings swell within my breast,
Yet their inner meaning ne’er can be expressed.

Pu- ri- fy my heart
Touch me with your cleansing fire
Take me to the cross
Ho li ness is my de si re
Breathe your life in me
Kindle a love that flows from your throne
Oh, pu ri fy my heart 
Purify my heart

It's a story so unkind in the Holy Book we find,
And it tells how Jesus stood alone one day.
False accused and there condemned,
Yet they found no fault with Him.
The man who wore the Scarlet Purple Robe.
Purple Robe my Savior wore ,oh the shame for me He bore,
as He stood alone forsaken, on that day.
And they placed upon His head, piercing thorns 
of blood stained red.
His raiment's was a Scarlet Purple Robe.
In the common judgement hall, He was mocked 
and scorned by all.
And the tears of sorrow fell upon His cheek,
Soldiers of the wicked man, smote Him with their evil hand
The man who wore the scarlet purple robe.
Words of truth,that day was plain,from the lips of Pilate came.
In this man, I find no reason He should die.
But the multitude then cried,"Let Him now be crucified,"
The Man who wore the Scarlet Purple Robe.

Lord You have a purpose
For all of my life
All I have seen
All of my strife
Has lead me to You, Lord
Please help me to choose, Lord
To follow You Home
Lord, You have a people
Just waiting to hear
A message from me
A message of cheer
Will lead them to You, Lord
Please help them to use me, Lord
To follow You Home
Abba Father
Send me Your calling
I will heed to You
I want to heed to You
Lord, You have a Son
For my life He died
All I have done
All I have lied
Sent Him to the cross, Lord
Oh why would You choose, Lord
To welcome me Home 

Want the world to know it
Think of your fellow man lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart (just do it)
You see it’s getting late please don’t hesitate
Put a little love in your heart (just do it)
And the world (and the world) will be a better place (be a much better place)
And the world (and the world) will be a better place (be a much better place)
For you (for you and me), and me (just wait and see), you just wait (for you and 
me just wait) and see (wait and see)
Another day goes by still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart (love, sweet love)
We want the world to know we won’t let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart (want the world to know it)
There is a yellow one
That won’t accept the black one
That won’t accept the red one
That won’t accept the white one
Take a good look around and if you’re looking down
Put a little love in your heart (love, sweet love)
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart (love, sweet love)
(Put a little love in your heart)
(Put a little love in your heart) People all over the world
(Put a little love in your heart) No greater love than this

(Put a little love in your heart) Better have it, gonna have it, know you need 
to have a little love
(Put a little love in your heart) Wouldn’t it be nice to start a love train
(Put a little love in your heart)
(Put a little love in your heart) No greater love than HIS!

Put thou thy trust in God,
In duty’s path go on;
Walk in His strength with faith and hope,
So shall thy work be done.
Commit thy ways to Him,
Thy works into His hands,
And rest on His unchanging Word,
Who Heav’n and earth commands.
Though years on years roll on,
His cov’nant shall endure;
Though clouds and darkness hide His path,
The promised grace is sure.
Give to the winds Thy fears;
Hope, and be undismayed;
God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears;
God shall lift up thy head.
Through waves, and clouds, and storms,
His power will clear thy way;
Wait thou His time, the darkest night
Shall end in brightest day.
Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command;
So shalt thou, wond’ring, own His way,
How wise, how strong His hand.

Put your hand in the hand of the Man who stilled the water.
Put your hand in the hand of the Man who parted the sea.
Take a look at your life, and you will look at others differently,
By putting your hand in the hand of the Man from Galilee.
Every time I look into the Holy Book, I want to tremble,
When I read about the part where a carpenter cleared the temple.
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellas that what I profess to 
be,
And it causes me pain to know I'm not the guy that I should be.
Put your hand in the hand of the Man who stilled the water.
Put your hand in the hand of the Man who parted the sea.
Take a look at your life, and you will look at others differently,
By putting your hand in the hand of the Man from Galilee.
Mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven,
And when I'm do on my knees, that's when I'm closest to Heaven.
Daddy lived his life with two kids and a wife, and you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through.
Put your hand in the hand of the Man who stilled the water.
Put your hand in the hand of the Man who parted the sea.
Take a look at your life, and you will look at others differently,
By putting your hand in the hand of the Man from Galilee.

Out in the wilderness wild and drear,
Sadly I’ve wandered for many a year,
Driven by hunger and filled with fear,
I will arise and go;
Backward with sorrow my steps to trace,
Seeking my heavenly Father’s face,
Willing to take but a servant’s place,
I will arise and go.
Back to my Father and home,
Back to my Father and home,
I will arise and go
Back to my Father and home.
Why should I perish in dark despair,
Here where there’s no one to help or care,
When there is shelter and food to spare?
I will arise and go;
Deeply repenting the wrong I’ve done,
Worthy no more to be called a son,
Hoping my Father His child may own,
I will arise and go.
Sweet are the memories that come to me,
Faces of loved ones again I see,
Visions of home where I used to be,
I will arise and go;
Others have gone who had wandered, too,
They were forgiven, were clothed anew,
Why should I linger with home in view?
I will arise and go.
O that I never had gone astray!
Life was all radiant with hope one day,
Now all its treasures I’ve thrown away,
Yet I’ll arise and go;
Something is saying, “God loves you still,
Tho’ you have treated His love so ill,"
I must not wait, for the night grows chill,
I will arise and go.

Quick to hear what's good and true
Quick to hear the best about you
Quick to listen, slow to speak
Slow to say a word unkind
Slow to say what's on my mind
(Quick and slow) Quick to listen, slow to speak 
The tongue is slight like the spark of an ember
Set the world on fire
And even though it's just a small member
It can take us all higher
A word can tear the people apart
Or heal a broken heart 
A tongue that's full of the deadly poison
It brings the sting of death
A tongue that's full of the sweet Holy Spirit
Is a life-giving breath
A word can curse and defile and can injure, or
A word can praise the Lord 
Don't want to fall for the wordly deception
And lose my goal
Don't want to practice a worthless religion
And lose my soul
Don't want to promise what I can't deliver
And I don't want to be cold 
(Quick to listen, slow) Quick to listen, slow
(Quick to listen, slow to speak) Quick to listen, slow to speak

Quickly from the empty tomb,
No more gloom or thought of doom,
Quickly from the empty tomb,
Tell the news of Jesus.
He lies not among the dead,
Risen again just as He said,
He lies not among the dead,
Tell the news of Jesus.
Spread the word throughout the land,
The kingdom of God is now at hand;
Spread the word throughout the land,
Tell the news of Jesus.
Let them know He loves them so,
And those who love Him to Him will go;
Let them know He loves them so,
Tell the news of Jesus.
Showing your smile for Jesus.
Sharing the joy of Jesus.
Living your life for Jesus!
Words: Brian M.Ames (1999)

Quiet, Lord, my forward heart,
Make me teachable and mild,
Upright, simple, free from art,
Make me as a weaned child:
From distrust and envy free,
Pleased with all that pleases Thee.
What Thou shalt today provide,
Let me as a child receive;
What tomorrow may betide,
Calmly to Thy wisdom leave:
’Tis enough that Thou wilt care,
Why should I the burden bear?
As a little child relies
On a care beyond his own;
Knows he’s neither strong nor wise,
Fears to stir a step alone:
Let me thus with Thee abide,
As my Father, Guard, and Guide.
Thus preserved from Satan’s wiles,
Safe from dangers, free from fears;
May I live upon Thy smiles,
Till the promised hour appears;
When the sons of God shall prove
All their Father’s boundless love.
Words: John Newton (1779)

Words: Matt Lusk 
Quiet, quiet, He is speaking
Quiet, quiet, can you hear Him calling?
Quiet, quiet, His voice so softly
Quiet, quiet, trust me, trust me
Can you hear Him, hear Him saying my child, my child
Hear Him, hear Him urging you to stop your sinning
Hear Him, hear Him, He is waiting, praying
Hear Him, hear Him saying come back home
Don’t you know He will never give up on you
Even if you give up on Him (He won't give up)
He’ll forever be there with His tender loving care
He will always take you back in
He is pleading (He, He is pleading), follow, follow
He is pleading (He, He is pleading), turn away, turn away
He is pleading (He, He is pleading) saying “I am The Way and The Truth and The 
Life
You need look no further it’s I that you seek"
Don’t you know (don't you know), Don't you know (don't you know)
He will always take you back in
Quiet, quiet

Speak, Lord, in the stillness
While I wait on Thee;
Hushed my heart to listen,
In expectancy.
Speak, O blessed Master,
In this quiet hour,
Let me see Thy face, Lord,
Feel Thy touch of power.
For the words Thou speakest,
“They are life" indeed;
Living Bread from heaven,
Now my spirit feed!
All to Thee is yielded,
I am not my own;
Blissful, glad surrender,
I am Thine alone.
Fill me with the knowledge
Of Thy glorious will;
All Thine own good pleasure
In my life fulfill.
Like “a watered garden"
Full of fragrance rare
Ling’ring in Thy presence
Let my life appear.
Words: E.May Grimes (1920)

The race that long in darkness pined,
Have seen a glorious Light;
The people dwell in day, who dwelt
In death’s surrounding night.
To hail Thy rise, Thou better Sun,
The gathering nations come,
Joyous as when the reapers bear
The harvest treasures home.
For Thou our burden hast removed,
And quelled the oppressor’s sway,
Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell
In Midian’s evil day.
To us a Child of Hope is born,
To us a Son is given,
Him shall the tribes of earth obey,
Him all the hosts of heaven.
His Name shall be the Prince of Peace,
Forevermore adored,
The Wonderful, the Counselor,
The great and mighty Lord.
His power increasing still shall spread,
His reign no end shall know:
Justice shall guard His throne above,
And peace abound below.

The radiant morn hath passed away,
And spent too soon her golden store;
The shadows of departing day
Creep on once more.
Our life is but an autumn sun,
Its glorious noon how quickly past!
Lead us, O Christ, our life work done,
Safe home at last.
O by Thy soul inspiring grace
Uplift our hearts to realms on high;
Help us to look to that bright place
Beyond the sky.
Where light, and life, and joy, and peace
In undivided empire reign,
And thronging angels never cease
Their deathless strain.
Where saints are clothed in spotless white,
And evening shadows never fall;
Where Thou, eternal Light of light,
Art Lord of all.

When the clouds hang dark and heavy,
And the rolling surge we hear,
When no earthly pow’r can shield us
From the storm that most we fear,
O ’tis then our Father’s presence
To the trusting heart is shown,
In a bright and glorious vision
Of the rainbow round the throne.
O the rainbow round the throne!
Lovely rainbow round the throne!
Ever brilliant, ever sparkling
Shines the rainbow round the throne.
When we stand amid the conflict
Of the battle raging high,
When the tempter seems to triumph,
And our ranks desponding fly,
With the fleetness of an arrow
God’s protecting care is shown,
In the brightness that descendeth
From the rainbow round the throne.
When the veil of time is lifted,
And the shadows melt away,
When we fall asleep in Jesus,
And awake in endless day,
When the battle march is ended,
And our cares and tears have flown,
We shall gaze, and gaze forever,
On the rainbow round the throne.

We are God's dear little raindrops
Waiting to serve Him today;
Singing His glad songs of praises,
Learning to watch and to pray.
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Sent from the fountain above;
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Filled with the light of God's love.
Jesus forgets not His raindrops,
For He has numbered them all;
Just as God knoweth the sparrows,
Grieving if any doth fall.
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Sent from the fountain above;
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Filled with the light of God's love.
It is God's wish that His raindrops
Out in the parch'd world should go;
Scattering blessings of mercy,
That all his goodness may know.
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Sent from the fountain above;
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Filled with the light of God's love.
We would do something for Jesus,
Showing that our love is true
So we will love one another,
As He has told us to do.
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Sent from the fountain above;
Raindrops, glad raindrops of mercy,
Filled with the light of God's love.

Blessed God, we bow in worship
May this house be filled with praise,
As we turn our eyes on Jesus
Dwell upon His earthly days.
With His blood He paid the ransom,
Broke our fetters, set us free,
Blessed Saviour, Thy salvation
Saves for all eternity.
Voices then we all lift heavenward
To the Lord of all Supreme
And like one of old in Scripture
In the temple in a dream.
Cherubim are there before Him,
Seraphim surround and sing,
O this wonder of all wonders
Jesus now is Lord and King.
Spread the word to all who love Him,
Raise an anthem to His name.
Jesus Christ the only Saviour
Yester-day, today the same.
Ground of peace and of salvation
O what grace and joy abound,
Grandest theme throughout the ages,
Praise the Lord, redemption ground.
Sing His praise and like a clarion,
Loud and long retain the sound.
For ‘tis through His great salvation,
That we are no longer bound.
Sin no more can have dominion,
In His death He set us free;
Shout this message to the nations,
“Jesus Christ brings liberty."

Raise the psalm: let earth adoring,
Through each kindred, tribe, and tongue,
To her God His praise restoring,
Raise the new accordant song.
Bless His Name, each farthest nation;
Sing His praise, His truth display:
Tell anew His high salvation,
With each new return of day.
Tell it out beneath the heaven
To each kindred, tribe and tongue,
Tell it out from morn till even
In your unexhausted song:
Tell that God forever reigneth,
He, Who set the world so fast,
He, Who still its state sustaineth
Till the day of doom to last.
Tell them that the day is coming
When that righteous doom shall be:
Then shall Heav’n new joys illumine,
Gladness shine o’er earth and sea.
Yea, the far resounding ocean
Shall its thousand voices raise,
All its waves in glad commotion
Chant the fullness of His praise.
And earth’s fields, with herbs and flowers,
Shall put on their choice array,
And in all their leafy bowers
Shall the woods keep holy day:
When the Judge, to earth descending,
Righteous judgment shall ordain,
Fraud and wrong shall then have ending,
Truth, immortal truth, shall reign.

Raise the song, raise the song, sound it far and near,
Let the notes of rapture swell
With the joyful words they tell;
Raise the song, raise the song, happy anthems bring,
Telling all who hear the call, the Lord is King.
Bring, merrily bring, voices and hearts to join the song,
Sing, merrily sing, raising a full and strong;
Ring, merrily ring, echoing bells from Heaven ring!
Joy we raise in a song of praise to Christ our King.
Raise the song, raise the song, over land and sea,
So our music may impart
Joy renewed in every heart;
Raise the song, raise the song, set the echoes free,
Words of praise, thro’ all our days, our song shall be.
Raise the song, raise the song, see the banners sway!
May they ever brightly shine
Glowing with a light divine;
Raise the song, raise the song, joyful anthems bring,
Music sweet must ever greet the Lord, our King.

After my trials and troubles are past,
After my burdens aside have been cast,
I shall see Jesus my Savior at last,
That will be rapture indeed!
That will be rapture indeed,
Glory and rapture indeed,
When I shall see Him Who died on the tree;
O that will be rapture for me!
When the last battle with sin shall be o’er,
When the wild tempest can beat me no more,
I shall see Jesus on heaven’s glad shore,
That will be rapture indeed!
When I behold Him and praise Him up there,
Singing with angels in garments most fair,
When in His glory at last I shall share,
That will be rapture indeed!

Reach out and touch a soul that is hungry, Reach out and touch a spirit in
despair; Reach out and touch a life torn and dirty, a man who is lonely…If you
care! Reach out and touch that neighbor who hates you; Reach out and touch
that stranger who meets you; Reach out and touch the brother who needs you;
Reach out and let the smile of God touch through you.
Reach out and touch a friend who is weary; Reach out and touch a seeker
unaware; Reach out and touch, though touching means losing a part of your
own self…If you dare! Reach out and give your love to the loveless; Reach out
and make a home for the homeless.Reach out and shed God’s light in the
darkness.Reach out and let the smile of God touch through you.

Is your burden heavy as you bear it all alone?
Does the road you travel harbour danger yet unknown?
Are you growing weary in the struggle of it all?
Jesus will help you when on His name you call.
He is always there hearing every prayer, faithful and true.
Walking by our side in His love we hide all the day through.
When you get discouraged just remember what to do,
Reach out to Jesus He's reaching out to you.
Is the life you're living filled with sorrow and despair?
Does the future press you with it's worry and it's care?
Are you tired and friendless, have you almost lost your way?
Jesus will help you, just come to Him today.

Reach for the glorious prize, the prize of God's "Well Done"
Learn to fix your eyes on the longings of the Son
Surrender all you are, let all be sacrificed
Reaching for excellence by giving all to Christ
Reaching for excellence by giving all to Christ
So follow Jesus Christ who lived a life unflawed
Think of who it is you know reverence as Lord
Because He gave His all, a crown is His reward
Reaching for excellence, our world He will restore
Reaching for excellence, our world He will restore
Give to the Lord your best, the best that you can do
As you honor Him, He will surely honor You
So learn to run the race until the race is done
Reaching for excellence until the prize is won
Reaching for excellence until the prize is won.

I can·t believe the way
Your love has got a hold on me
Each morning I wake to find You near
Your lift me above my fears
And set my feet on solid ground
All of my days belong to You
PRE-
And I breathe in Your
Breathe of life that fills my heart
You are my all consuming fire
And I stand here before You
In wide-opended wonder
Amazed at the Glory of You
The power of heaven
Revealing Your purpose in me
As I·m reaching for You

Ready to suffer grief or pain,
Ready to stand the test,
Ready to stay at home and send
Others if He sees best.
Ready to go, ready to stay,
Ready my place to fill,
Ready for service, lowly or great,
Ready to do His will.
Ready to go, ready to bear,
Ready to watch and pray,
Ready to stand aside and give,
Till He shall clear the way.
Ready to speak, ready to think,
Ready with heart and brain,
Ready to stand where He sees fit,
Ready to bear the strain.
Ready to speak, ready to warn,
Ready o’er souls to yearn,
Ready in life, ready in death,
Ready for His return.

There's comin' a day when the world shall melt away
And Jesus shall come to claim His own
No more tears, no pain, no woe, in this wicked world below
Then will you be ready to go home
Will you be ready to go, ready to go home
To live with Him up there around the throne
When He says come unto Me, will your soul be clean and free
Then will you be ready to go home
In this world of greed and hate will you wait til it's too late
To claim the Saviour for your own
For He's coming someday, to bear your soul away
Then will you be ready to go home
As you travel day by day, down life's long highway
Are you on the road that leads to wrong
If you'll just travel in His light and pray both day and night
Then you'll be ready to go home

Reap me the earth as a harvest to God,
gather and bring it again,
all that is his, to the maker of all;
lift it and offer it high.
Bring bread, bring wine,
give glory to the Lord;
whose is the earth but God's,
whose is the praise but his?
Go with your song and your music, with joy,
go to the altar of God;
carry your offerings, fruits of the earth,
work of your labouring hands:
Gladness and pity and passion and pain,
all that is mortal in man,
lay all before him, return him his gift,
God, to whom all shall go home.

Standing in the market places all the season through,
Idly saying, “Lord, is there no work that I can do?"
O how many loiter, while the Master calls anew—
“Reapers! reapers! Who will work today?"
Lift thine eyes and look upon the fields that stand
Ripe and ready for the willing gleaner’s hand,
Rouse ye, O sleepers! Ye are needed as reapers!
Who will be the first to answer, “Master, here am I."
Far and wide the ripened grain is bending low,
In the breezes gently waving to and fro,
Rouse ye, O sleepers! Ye are needed as reapers!
And the golden harvest days are swiftly passing by.
Ev’ry sheaf you gather will become a jewel bright
In the crown you hope to wear in yonder world of light.
Seek the gems immortal that are precious in His sight!
“Reapers! reapers! Who will work today?"
Morning hours are passing, and the ev’ning follows fast;
Soon the time of reaping will forevermore be past.
Empty handed to the Master will you go at last?
“Reapers! reapers! Who will work today?"

Hark to the music resounding,
Reapers are needed today;
Fields are all white, to the harvest
Let us be up and away!
Ever the Master is calling,
Hasten! the shadows are falling;
On to the harvest field,
Gather the golden yield,
Precious sheaves.
Hark! hark! comes the song,
On! on! join the throng;
Forth with joyful, loving heart,
Bravely do your part;
Hark! hark! rings the call;
Haste! haste! one and all;
On where the harvest stands,
Waiting for willing hands
Souls to win.
Forward with hearts full of gladness,
Reapers, I pray you, make haste;
Grain there is ready and waiting,
If not soon gathered, will waste;
Then let us hear you replying,
Labor with courage undying,
Send up a word of cheer,
Tell of the rest so near,
Rest at home.
Hark to the song they are singing!
See, they have treasures so rare;
Soon will the harvest be ended,
Haste, then, their trophies to share.
Let no one be idly dreaming,
Look! look! the harvest is gleaming,
Join ye the reaping band,
Lend them a helping hand,
Ere the night.

Reels, who had dared to show
Proud contempt of God Most High
Bound in iron and in woe,
Shades of death and darkness nigh,
Humbled low with toil and pain,
Fell, and looked for help in vain.
To Jehovah when they cried
In their trouble, and He saved,
Threw the prison open wide
Where they lay to death enslaved,
Bade the gloomy shadows flee,
Broke their bonds and set them free.
Sons of men, awake to praise
God the Lord Who reigns above,
Gracious in His works and ways,
Wondrous in redeeming love;
Longing souls He satisfies,
Hungry hearts with good supplies.
When His righteous judgments come,
Strong to bless and to destroy,
All iniquity is dumb,
All the righteous sing for joy;
Who God’s dealings wisely heed,
In His works His mercy read.
Hark to the song they are singing!
See, they have treasures so rare;
Soon will the harvest be ended,
Haste, then, their trophies to share.
Let no one be idly dreaming,
Look! look! the harvest is gleaming,
Join ye the reaping band,
Lend them a helping hand,
Ere the night.

Receive, O Lord, in Heaven above
Our prayers and supplications pure;
Give us a heart all full of love
And steady courage to endure.
Thy holy Name our mouths confess,
Our tongues are harps to praise Thy grace;
Forgive our sins and wickedness,
Who in this vigil seek Thy face.
Let not our song become a sigh,
A wail of anguish and despair;
In lovingkindness, Lord most high,
Receive tonight our evening prayer.
O raise us in that day, that we
May sing, where all Thy saints adore,
Praise to Thy Father, and to Thee,
And to Thy Spirit, evermore.

I'm redeemed, I will proclaim it,
I'm redeemed by blood divine;
Now He seals me with His Spirit,
I am His and He is mine.
I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed through the blood,
I will praise Him who brought me home to God;
With the ransomed my voice I will raise,
Making vocal the earth with His praise.
I'm redeemed, I love to tell it
To the world of sinners lost;
In the Savior's cleansing fountain
I was saved at boundless cost.
I'm redeemed, oh, wondrous story!
All my sins are washed away;
I am walking in the glory
Of a bright celestial day.
I'm redeemed, oh, hear it sounding
Through the valley, o弾r the plain;
In His love my heart's abounding,
Cleansed from every sinful stain.

Redeemed, and with the price of blood,
Which Thou hast shed for me,
I stand, a monument of grace,
A witness, Lord, for Thee.
Redeemed, and made by simple faith
An heir of heaven above!
Oh, love surpassing human thought!
Oh, vast, unmeasured love!
Redeemed, no longer dead to sin,
But raised by pow’r divine,
My tongue, rejoicing, cries aloud,
All glory, Lord, be Thine.
Redeemed, my heart is filled with praise,
My soul true comfort knows,
And daily feels the calm of peace
That like a river flows.
Redeemed, I’ll tell it o’er and o’er;
Redeemed my song shall be,
My watchword through the vale of death,
My passport home to Thee.

Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever I am.
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child and forever I am.
Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.
I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long:
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.
I know there’s a crown that is waiting,
In yonder bright mansion for me,
And soon, with the spirits made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be.

Redeemed, restored, forgiven,
Through Jesus’ precious blood,
Heirs of His home in heaven,
Oh, praise our pardoning God!
Praise Him in tuneful measures
Who gave His Son to die;
Praise Him Whose sev’nfold treasures
Enrich and sanctify.
Once on the dreary mountain
We wandered far and wide,
Far from the cleansing fountain,
Far from the pierced side;
But Jesus sought and found us
And washed our guilt away;
With cords of love He bound us
To be His own for aye.
Dear Master, Thine the glory
Of each recovered soul,
Ah! who can tell the story
Of love that made us whole?
Not ours, not ours, the merit;
Be Thine alone the praise
And ours a thankful spirit
To serve Thee all our days.
Now keep us, holy Savior,
In Thy true love and fear
And grant us of Thy favor
The grace to persevere
Till, in Thy new creation,
Earth’s time-long travail o’er,
We find our full salvation
And praise Thee evermore.

Redeemer of Israel, our only Delight,
On Whom for a blessing we call,
Our Shadow by day, and our Pillar by night,
Our King, our Deliverer, our All!
We know He is coming, to gather His sheep
And lead them to Zion in love;
For why in the valley of death should they weep
Or in the lone wilderness rove?
How long we have wandered as strangers in sin,
And cried in the desert for Thee!
Our foes have rejoiced when our sorrows they’ve seen,
But Israel will shortly be free.
As children of Zion, good tidings for us.
The tokens already appear.
Fear not, and be just, for the kingdom is ours.
The hour of redemption is near.

I know You had me on your mind
When You climbed up on that hill
For You saw me with eternal eyes
While I was yet in sin
Redeemer Savior Friend
Every stripe upon Your battered back
Every thorn that pierced Your brow
Every nail drove deep through guiltless hands
Said that Your love knows no end
Redeemer Savior Friend
Redeemer, redeem my heart again
Savior, shelter me from sin
You're familiar with my weaknesses
Devoted to the end
Redeemer Savior Friend
So the grace you poured out on my life
Will return to You in praise
I'll gladly lay down all my crowns
For the name of which I'm saved
Redeemer Savior Friend

Redemption! oh, wonderful story—
Glad message for you and for me;
That Jesus has purchased our pardon,
And paid all the debt on the tree.
Believe it, O sinner, believe it;
Receive the glad message—’tis true;
Trust now in the crucified Savior,
Salvation He offers to you.
From death unto life He has brought us,
And made us by grace sons of God;
A fountain is opened for sinners;
Oh, wash and be cleansed in the blood!
No longer shall sin have dominion,
Though present to tempt and annoy;
For Christ, in His blessed redemption,
The power of sin shall destroy.
Accept now God’s offer of mercy;
To Jesus, oh hasten today;
For He will receive him that cometh,
And never will turn him away.

Years of time have come and gone 
Since I first heard it told 
How Jesus would come again some day 
If back then it seemed so real 
Then I just can’t help but feel 
How much closer His coming is today 
Signs of the times are everywhere 
There’s a brand new feeling in the air 
Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky 
Lift up your head redemption draweth nigh 
Wars and strife on every hand 
And violence fills the land 
Still some people doubt He’ll ever come again 
But the Word of God is true 
He’ll redeem His chosen few 
Don’t lose hope soon Christ Jesus will descend 
Signs of the times are everywhere 
There’s a brand new feeling in the air 
Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky 
Lift up your head redemption draweth nigh 
Lift up your head redemption draweth nigh

Come sing, my soul, and praise the Lord,
Who hath redeemed thee by His blood;
Delivered thee from chains that bound,
And brought thee to redemption ground.
Redemption ground, the ground of peace!
Redemption ground, O wondrous grace!
Here let our praise to God abound!
Who saves us on redemption ground.
Once from my God I wandered far,
And with His holy will made war;
But now my songs to God abound;
I’m standing on redemption ground.
O joyous hour! when God to me
A vision gave of Calvary;
My bonds were loosed—my soul unbound;
I sang upon redemption ground.
No words of merit now I plead,
But Jesus take for all my need;
No righteousness in me is found,
Except upon redemption ground.
Come, weary soul, and here find rest;
Accept redemption, and be blest;
The Christ who died, by God is crowned
To pardon on redemption ground.

Purify my heart
Let me be as gold and precious silver.
Purify my heart
Let me be as gold, pure gold.
Refiner's fire, my heart's one desire
Is to be holy, set apart for You, Lord.
I choose to be holy, set apart for You, my Master;
Ready to do Your will
Purify my heart;
Cleanse me from within and make me holy;
Purify my heart;
Cleanse me from my sin, deep within.

Purify my heart
Let me be as gold and precious silver.
Purify my heart
Let me be as gold, pure gold.
Refiner's fire, my heart's one desire
Is to be holy, set apart for You, Lord.
I choose to be holy, set apart for You, my Master;
Ready to do Your will
Purify my heart;
Cleanse me from within and make me holy;
Purify my heart;
Cleanse me from my sin, deep within.

1
Refresh my heart Lord,
Renew my love.
Pour Your Spirit into my soul.
Refresh my heart.
You set me apart Lord,
To make me new.
By Your Spirit lift me up Lord,
Refresh my heart.
And I will worship You Lord,
With all of my heart.
And I will follow You Lord,
Refresh my heart.

Lord, I have found a refuge in You
A hiding place where I can enter in
I meet You there and tell You all my troubles
You touch my heart and I am comforted
I love You, I need You, You're my saving King
Holy, awesome, God of everything
Refuge, shelter, I'm safe beneath Your wings
Jesus, Your love covers me
You're my defence when I'm afraid
When troubles come I call Your name
I lift my eyes to the highest place
The dark clouds break, and 
I can see Your face
I can see Your face
I can see Your face

Regard my grief and rescue me,
For I do not forget Thy laws;
As Thou hast promised, save me, Lord,
Redeem my soul, and plead my cause.
Far is salvation from the men
Who do not seek Thy statutes, Lord;
Great are Thy mercies, quicken me
According to Thy holy Word.
I bear the spite of many foes,
Yet from Thy law I do not swerve;
I saw the faithless and was grieved,
For they Thy Word do not observe.
Behold how I Thy precepts love!
In kindness, Lord, revive Thou me;
The sum of all Thy Word is truth;
Thy Word abides eternally.

To the regions beyond I must go, I must go
Where the story has never been told;
To the millions that never have heard of His love,
I must tell the sweet story of old.
To the regions beyond I must go, I must go,
Till the world, all the world,
His salvation shall know.
To the hardest of places He calls me to go,
Never thinking of comfort or ease;
The world may pronounce me a dreamer, a fool,
Enough if the Master I please.
Oh, you that are spending your leisure and powers
In those pleasures so foolish and fond;
Awake from your selfishness, folly and sin,
And go to the regions beyond.
There are other “lost sheep" that the Master must bring,
And to them must the message be told;
He sends me to gather them out of all lands,
And welcome them back to His fold.

Do you triumph, O my brother,
Over all this world of sin?
In each storm of tribulation,
Does your Jesus reign within? 
I am reigning, sweetly reigning,
Far above this world of strife;
In my blessed, loving Savior,
I am reigning in this life.
One we hail as King immortal,
He did earth and hell subdue;
And bequeathing us His glory,
We are kings anointed, too.
Shall we then by sin be humbled?
Must we yield to any foe?
No, by heaven’s gift we’re reigning
Over all this world below.
Oh, what grace and high promotion,
That in Jesus I should be
Raised from sin to royal honor,
Even reigning, Lord, with Thee.
All this life is blissful sunshine,
Earth is subject at our feet;
Heaven pours its richest blessings
Round our throne of love complete.
Then we’ll sing and shout the story,
Of the wondrous blood divine;
Full salvation, glory, glory!
I am reigning all the time.

Rejoice and be glad!
The Redeemer has come!
Go look on His cradle,
His cross, and His tomb.
Sound His praises, tell the story,
Of Him Who was slain;
Sound His praises, tell with gladness,
He liveth again.
Rejoice and be glad!
It is sunshine at last!
The clouds have departed,
The shadows are past.
Rejoice and be glad!
For the blood hath been shed;
Redemption is finished,
The price has been paid.
Rejoice and be glad!
Now the pardon is free!
The Just for the unjust
Has died on the tree.
Rejoice and be glad!
For the Lamb that was slain
O’er death is triumphant,
And liveth again.
Rejoice and be glad!
For our King is on high,
He pleadeth for us on
His throne in the sky.
Rejoice and be glad!
For He cometh again;
He cometh to glory,
The Lamb that was slain.
Sound His praises, tell the story,
Of Him Who was slain;
Sound His praises, tell with gladness,
He cometh again.

From my soul and all within,
Let eternal music spring;
Melodies of love and gratitude,
To our Father’s name above,
And the Son of heaven’s love,
Who hath made in us His sweet abode.
Oh, rejoice forevermore,
For He’s washed our garments white;
Oh, rejoice forevermore,
In this blessed evening light.
In our happy souls a voice
Bids us evermore rejoice,
And again rejoice, ye royal seed!
Oh, we cannot cease to sing
Praises to our heav’nly King,
For the love of God we feel indeed.
Hallelujah! we are free,
Children of the jubilee,
And we’ll sound the golden harps of God;
All is bright, supernal day,
And our tears are wiped away,
Through the precious all-atoning blood

Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days!
A world without saints forgets how to praise.
Their faith in acquiring the habit of prayer,
their depth of adoring, Lord, help us to share.
Some march with events, to turn them God's way;
some need to withdraw, the better to pray;
some carry the gospel through fire and through flood:
our world is their parish: their purpose is God.
Rejoice in those saints, unpraised and unknown,
who bear someone's cross, or shoulder their own:
they share our complaining, our comforts, our cares:
what patience in caring, what courage is theirs!
Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days!
A world without saints forgets how to praise.
in loving, in living, they prove it is true:
The way of self-giving, Lord, leads us to you.

by Ron Hamilton
God never moves without purpose or plan
When trying His servant and molding a man.
Give thanks to the LORD though your testing seems long;
In darkness He giveth a song.
I could not see through the shadows ahead;
So I looked at the cross of my Savior instead.
I bowed to the will of the Master that day;
Then peace came and tears fled away.
Now I can see testing comes from above;
God strengthens His children and purges in love.
My Father knows best, and I trust in His care;
Through purging more fruit I will bear.
O Rejoice in the LORD
He makes no mistake,
He knoweth the end of each path that I take,
For when I am tried
And purified,
I shall come forth as gold.

Rejoice in the Lord always
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice in the Lord always
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice, Rejoice
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice, Rejoice
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice in the Lord always
And again I say Rejoice 
Rejoice in the Lord always
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice, Rejoice
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice, Rejoice
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice in the Lord always
And again I say Rejoice 
Rejoice in the Lord always
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice, Rejoice
And again I say Rejoice
Rejoice, Rejoice
And again I say Rejoice

Rejoice! the year upon its way
Has brought again that blessed day,
When on the chosen of the Lord
The Holy Spirit was outpoured.
On each the fire, descending, stood
In quivering tongues’ similitude—
Tongues, that their words might ready prove,
And fire, to make them flame with love.
To all in every tongue they spoke;
Amazement in the crowd awoke,
Who mocked, as overcome with wine,
Those who were filled with power divine.
These things were done in type that day,
When Eastertide had passed away,
The number told which once set free
The captive at the jubilee.
And now, O holy God, this day
Regard us as we humbly pray,
And send us, from Thy heavenly seat,
The blessings of the Paraclete.
To God the Father, God, the Son,
And God the Spirit, praise be done;
May Christ the Lord upon us pour
The Spirit’s gift forevermore.

Rejoice today with glad accord,
For Christ, the Lord, is come:
Fulfilled the prophetic word,
In David’s Bethlehem.
For unto us a Child is born;
To us a Son is given;
To raise our fallen nature up,
And make us heirs of Heav’n.
Behold Him in a manger laid:
A helpless little One;
For Whom Judea’s mothers prayed;
The long expected Son.
No earthly pomp surrounds His bed,
His home no pillared hall:
They had not where to lay His head,
Save in the cattle stall.
The King of Heav’n— the Prince of Life,
Assumes a mortal frame;
He comes to enter into strife,
To weave immortal fame.
His weapons truth and righteousness;
The cause the good of all,
The helpless sons of Adam’s race,
The ruined by the fall.
Hail, glorious Prince! Hail, blessed Son!
On this Thy natal day
Let love and peace untrammeled run,
O’er all the earth hold sway,
Till human passion, sin, and wrongs,
Are numbered with the past,
And earth with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall praise Thee “First and Last."

Rejoice today with one accord,
Sing out with exultation;
Rejoice and praise our mighty Lord,
Whose arm hath brought salvation;
His works of love proclaim
The greatness of His Name;
For He is God alone
Who hath His mercy shown;
Let all His saints adore Him!
When in distress to Him we cried,
He heard our sad complaining;
O trust in Him, whate’er betide,
His love is all sustaining;
Triumphant songs of praise
To Him our hearts shall raise;
Now every voice shall say,
“O praise our God alway";
Let all His saints adore Him!
Rejoice today with one accord,
Sing out with exultation;
Rejoice and praise our mighty Lord,
Whose arm hath brought salvation;
His works of love proclaim
The greatness of His Name;
For He is God alone
Who hath His mercy shown;
Let all His saints adore Him!

Rejoice today with one accord,

Let all His saints adore Him!
When in distress to Him we cried,
He heard our sad complaining;

Rejoice and praise our mighty Lord,
Whose arm hath brought salvation;
His works of love proclaim
The greatness of His Name;
For He is God alone
Who hath His mercy shown;
Let all His saints adore Him!

Rejoice, ye people, homage give,
To God with voice of triumph sing;
He ruleth in dread majesty,
The great, the universal King.
He putteth nations under us
And maketh us triumphant stand;
He giveth for our heritage
His promised rest, a goodly land.
God hath ascended with a shout,
Jehovah with the trumpet’s sound;
Sing praise to God our King, sing praise,
Yes, let His glorious praise abound.
Our God is King of all the earth,
With thoughtful heart His praise make known;
O’er all the nations God doth reign,
Exalted on His holy throne.
To praise and serve our cov’nant God
The princes of the earth draw nigh;
All kingly pow’rs belong to Him,
He is exalted, God most high.

Rejoice ye pure in heart;
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;
Your glorious banner wave on high,
The cross of Christ your King.
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice,
Give thanks and sing.
Bright youth and snow crowned age,
Strong men and maidens meek,
Raise high your free, exultant song,
God’s wondrous praises speak.
Yes onward, onward still
With hymn, and chant and song,
Through gate, and porch and columned aisle,
The hallowed pathways throng.
With all the angel choirs,
With all the saints of earth,
Pour out the strains of joy and bliss,
True rapture, noblest mirth.
Your clear hosannas raise;
And alleluias loud;
Whilst answering echoes upward float,
Like wreaths of incense cloud.
With voice as full and strong
As ocean’s surging praise,
Send forth the hymns our fathers loved,
The psalms of ancient days.
Yes, on through life’s long path,
Still chanting as ye go;
From youth to age, by night and day,
In gladness and in woe.
Still lift your standard high,
Still march in firm array,
As warriors through the darkness toil,
Till dawns the golden day.
At last the march shall end;
The wearied ones shall rest;
The pilgrims find their heavenly home,
Jerusalem the blessed.
Then on, ye pure in heart!
Rejoice, give thanks and sing!
Your glorious banner wave on high,
The cross of Christ your King.
Praise Him Who reigns on high,
The Lord Whom we adore,
The Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
One God forevermore.

Rejoice! the year upon its way
Has brought again that blessed day,
When on the chosen of the Lord
The Holy Spirit was outpoured.
On each the fire, descending, stood
In quivering tongues’ similitude—
Tongues, that their words might ready prove,
And fire, to make them flame with love.
To all in every tongue they spoke;
Amazement in the crowd awoke,
Who mocked, as overcome with wine,
Those who were filled with power divine.
These things were done in type that day,
When Eastertide had passed away,
The number told which once set free
The captive at the jubilee.
And now, O holy God, this day
Regard us as we humbly pray,
And send us, from Thy heavenly seat,
The blessings of the Paraclete.
To God the Father, God, the Son,
And God the Spirit, praise be done;
May Christ the Lord upon us pour
The Spirit’s gift forevermore.

Rejoice, O land, in God thy might,
His will obey, Him serve aright;
For Thee the saints uplift their voice:
Fear not, O land, in God rejoice.
Glad shalt thou be, with blessing crowned,
With joy and peace thou shalt abound;
Yea, Love with thee shall make His home
Until thou see God’s kingdom come.
He shall forgive thy sins untold:
Remember thou His love of old;
Walk in His way, His word adore,
And keep His truth for evermore.

Rejoice, rejoice, believers, and let your lights appear.
The evening is advancing, and darker night is near.
The Bridegroom is arising, and soon He draweth nigh.
Up, pray, and watch, and wrestle: At midnight comes the cry.
See that your lamps are burning; replenish them with oil.
And wait for your salvation, the end of earthly toil.
The watchers on the mountain proclaim the Bridegroom near.
Go meet Him as He cometh, with alleluias clear.
O wise and holy virgins, now raise your voices higher,
Until in songs of triumph ye meet the angel choir.
The marriage feast is waiting, the gates wide open stand;
Rise up, ye heirs of glory, the Bridegroom is at hand.
Our hope and expectation, O Jesus, now appear!
Arise, Thou Sun so longed for, over this benighted sphere!
With hearts and hands uplifted, we plead, O Lord, to see
The day of earth’s redemption that brings us unto Thee.
Ye saints, who here in patience your cross and sufferings bore,
Shall live and reign forever, when sorrow is no more.
Around the throne of glory the Lamb ye shall behold;
In triumph cast before Him your diadems of gold!

Rejoice, rejoice, ye Christians, with all your heart this morn!
O hear the blessed tidings, the Lord, the Christ is born,
Now brought us by the angels that stand about God’s throne;
O lovely are the voices that make such tidings known!
O hearken to their singing! This Child shall be your Friend;
The Father so hath willed it, that thus your woes should end.
The Son is freely given, that in Him ye may have
The Father’s grace and blessing, and know He loves to save.
Nor deem the form too lowly that clothes Him at this hour;
For know ye what it hideth? ’Tis God’s almighty power.
Though now within the manger so poor and weak He lies,
He is the Lord of all things, He reigns above the skies.

Rejoice, the Lord is King! Your Lord and King adore;
Mortals give thanks and sing, and triumph evermore;
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
Jesus, the Savior, reigns, the God of truth and love;
When He had purged our stains He took His seat above;
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
His kingdom cannot fail, He rules o’er earth and Heav’n,
The keys of death and hell are to our Jesus giv’n;
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
He sits at God’s right hand till all His foes submit,
And bow to His command, and fall beneath His feet:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
He all His foes shall quell, shall all our sins destroy,
And every bosom swell with pure seraphic joy;
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice,
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
Rejoice in glorious hope! Jesus the Judge shall come,
And take His servants up to their eternal home.
We soon shall hear th’archangel’s voice;
The trump of God shall sound, rejoice!

To you, oh Lord I bring my worship
And offering of love to you
Surrounding in your holy presence
All I can say is that I love you
Give ear to the groaning in my spirit
Hear the crying in my heart
Release my soul to freely worship
For I was made to give you honor
Ho - ly, ho - ly, ho - ly, ho - ly
Release my soul
Release my soul to love you
Release my soul to know you, to see you
Release my soul
Release my heart to know you
Release my eyes to see you
Release my hands to touch you
Release my soul
Release my soul

Religion is the chief concern
Of mortals here below:
May I its great importance learn
Its sovereign virtue know!
O may my heart, by grace renewed,
Be my Redeemer’s throne;
And be my stubborn will subdued,
His government to own!
Let deep repentance, faith, and love
Be joined with godly fear;
And all my conversation prove
My heart to be sincere.
Let lively hope my soul inspire;
Let warm affections rise;
And may I wait with strong desire
To mount above the skies!

Religion! what a vast estate,
On guilty worms bestowed!
Not all the riches of the great,
Are worth this gift of God!
How transient is all earthly bliss!
How poor is shining gold!
And mortal crowns, compared with this,
How worthless to behold!
In all things else let me be crossed,
Lord, give this pearl to me,
Without it I'm forever lost,
To all eternity.

Remember all the people
Who live in far off lands
In strange and lovely cities
Or roam the desert sands,
Or farm the mountain pastures
Or till the endless plains
Where children wade through rice fields
And watch the camel trains.
Some work in sultry forests
Where apes swing to and fro,
Some fish in mighty rivers,
Some hunt across the snow.
Remember all God’s children,
Who yet have never Heard
The truth that comes from Jesus,
The glory of His Word.
God bless the men and women
Who serve Him overseas;
God raise up more to help them
To set the nations free,
Till all the distant people
In every foreign place
Shall understand His kingdom,
And come into His grace.

Remember Christ, our Savior
Who paid the debts you owed
To God the Heavenly Father
And to you mercy showed.
When others sin against you
Be ready to forgive.
Since you have been forgiven
With them in peace now live.
Go first to find your brother,
Your sister or your friend.
Do not reveal to others
The hurt you need to mend.
Confront in humble spirit
The one whose sin caused pain
That he might seek forgiveness
And you a friend regain.
When bitter anger tempts you
To nurse your broken heart
With brooding thoughts of hatred
And vows of vengeance start.
Pray to the Lord of Pardon
For power to release
Each selfish act against you
That rage might in you cease.
O Father, Son, and Spirit,
O Patient Trinity,
Who lifts from us sin’s burden
And from its debt sets free.
Grant us the will to pardon
All those who us offend
That we might enter heaven
With them when ages end.

Lord, 
I have heard of Your fame
And I stand in awe of Your deeds
Lord, 
I have heard of Your fame
And I stand in awe of Your deeds
Oh Lord
Renew them, renew them
In our day, and in our time, make them known
Renew them, renew them
In our day, and in our time, make them known
In wrath, remember mercy
In wrath, remember mercy

Remember not, O God,
The sins of long ago;
In tender mercy visit us,
Distressed and humbled low.
O Lord, our Savior, help,
And glorify Thy Name;
Deliver us from all our sins,
And take away our shame.
In Thy compassion hear
Thy prisoner’s plaintive sigh,
And in the greatness of Thy power
Save those about to die.
Then, safe within Thy fold,
We will exalt Thy Name;
Our thankful hearts with songs of joy
Thy goodness will proclaim.

Renew me, O eternal Light,
And let my heart and soul be bright,
Illumined with the light of grace
That issues from Thy holy face.
Destroy in me the lust of sin,
From all impureness make me clean.
Oh, grant me power and strength, my God,
To strive against my flesh and blood! 
Create in me a new heart, Lord,
That gladly I obey Thy Word
And naught but what Thou wilt, desire;
With such new life my soul inspire.
Grant that I only Thee may love
And seek those things which are above
Till I behold Thee face to face,
O Light eternal, through Thy grace.

“Repent, the kingdom draweth nigh,"
The herald of the Lord doth cry.
Ye sinners lost through Adam’s fall,
Will ye not hearken to the call?
Repent! The gracious call believe,
Haste His forgiveness to receive.
The Prince of Life, incarnate Word,
Life and salvation can afford.
Divine Redeemer, glorious King!
Repentant hearts to Thee we bring.
Thy holy blood for us was spilt,
Cleanse us from all the stains of guilt.
Drawn by Thy Spirit, through Thy Word,
Thine invitation have we heard.
In answer to Thy sweet request,
We come to Thee, O Christ, for rest.
Thy pardon, full, complete, and free,
Removes sin’s awful penalty.
Our Father’s love is now restored;
Thou hast redeemed us, dearest Lord.
Let us Thy Name forever bless,
On earth Thy Gospel truth confess,
Till saved by grace, through faith in Thee,
The gates of paradise we see.

Repent! ’tis the voice of Jesus
Now sounding in your ear;
The message of God rings loud and clear,
Now seek Him, for He is near.
Repent! and be ye saved,
Repent! and be ye saved,
Repent! and be ye saved,
Repent! and be ye saved.
Repent! while the Lord invites you;
Before the Savior fall;
The wages of sin is death to all
Who heed not the Gospel call.
Repent! while the Holy Spirit
Is striving with your soul;
The burden of sin on Jesus roll,
Surrender to His control.
Repent! for the days are flying;
The final hour draws nigh;
No pleasure have I, saith God on high,
In seeing the wicked die.
Repent! for He made atonement;
He took the sinner’s place;
O turn to the Lord, and seek His face,
And trust in His saving grace.

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.
Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand’rer a Savior has died.

Out from the snare of the fowler,
Out from the trappings of sin,
Out from the cage of deception,
Where sadly my spirit had been,
Into the glorious morning
Of soul-cheering sunshine and dew;
Out from the soul-crushing darkness,
To heavenly rapturous view.
Free! free in Jesus!
Out of sin’s domain:
The Lion of Judah
Has broken every chain.
Out from the toils, where the tempter
Never again shall impose
Shackles of cruelest bondage,
Of service, deception, and woes!
Into the city of Zion
My soul for its refuge has fled;
Safe from the darts of the wicked,
No more His vile torture to dread.
Out from the shades of confusion,
Into the courts of our God;
Into the fold, where the Shepherd
Doth lead by His staff and His rod;
Sweetly my soul on His bosom,
So tenderly, lovingly borne,
Rests from earth’s sorrows forever,
No longer in sadness to mourn.

Whate’er my afflictions or trials may be,
I want to live faithful, my Savior, to Thee,
To walk as a Christian, my temper subdued,
And feel, through Thy mercy, in spirit renewed.
Home, home, home, sweet, sweet home,
I know there is rest with Thy people at home,
I know there is rest with Thy people at home.
Though dark is my path in this valley of sin,
O give me the light of Thy comfort within,
To shield me from danger wherever I roam,
And guide me at last to Thy people at home.
I want to be humble, resigned to Thy will,
In sunshine or tempest to follow Thee still,
Yet, lured by the tempter, how often I roam,
Forgetful, alas! of my God and my home.
No parent so tender, so friend is so dear,
No voice like my Savior’s can banish my fear;
By faith in Thy promise to Thee I will come,
O, give me a place with Thy people at home.
When shall I rise from this desert of gloom,
Beyond the deep shadows that darken the tomb,
In Eden, dear Eden, transported to roam,
And sing hallelujahs with angels at home?

In the Christian’s home in glory
There remains a land of rest;
There my Savior’s gone before me,
To fulfill my soul’s request.
There is rest for the weary,
There is rest for the weary,
There is rest for the weary,
There is rest for you.
On the other side of Jordan,
In the sweet fields of Eden,
Where the tree of life is blooming,
There is rest for you.
He is fitting up my mansion,
Which eternally shall stand,
For my stay shall not be transient,
In that holy, happy land.
Pain and sickness ne’er shall enter,
Grief nor woe my lot shall share;
But, in that celestial center,
I a crown of life shall wear.
Death itself shall then be vanquished,
And his sting shall be withdrawn;
Shout for gladness, O ye ransomed!
Hail with joy the rising morn.

O why are you clinging to earth’s fading flow’rs,
Tho’ fragrant its blossoms and lovely its bow’rs?
The cold breath of winter will sweep them away,
Then why from your fatherland,
O why will you stay?
Why will you stay? Jesus calls you today,
Your poor aching hearts for rest are longing still,
And yet in His mercy you may rest if you will.
O why are you dreaming of hopes that are frail,
That die like the leaflet when tossed by the gale?
The heart’s weary longings the world cannot still,
And yet in the Savior you may rest if you will.
O why are you slighting the voice of the Lord,
Refusing to follow His life giving Word?
No love like the Savior’s your lone hearts can fill,
That love is inviting you to rest if you will.
O why are you waiting when time flies apace?
Take heed that ye spurn not God’s message of grace;
O trust not the pleasures that charm to deceive,
But come to the Savior and, repenting, believe.

Rest of the weary,
joy of the sad,
hope of the dreary,
light of the glad,
home of the stranger,
strength to the end,
refuge from danger,
Savior and Friend.
Pillow where, lying,
love rests its head;
peace of the dying,
life of the dead;
path of the lowly,
prize at the end;
breath of the holy,
Savior and Friend.
When my feet stumble,
I'll to thee cry;
crown of the humble,
cross of the high:
when my steps wander,
over me bend,
truer and fonder,
Savior and Friend.
Thee still confessing,
ever I'll raise
unto thee blessing,
glory, and praise:
all my endeavor,
world without end,
thine to be ever,
Savior and Friend.

’Tis a blessed hope, and it cheers my soul,
I shall rest by and by over Jordan;
When my work is done and my crown is won,
I shall rest, sweetly rest over Jordan.
Over Jordan, over Jordan, I shall rest
Sweetly rest by and by;
’Tis a precious hope, ’tis a blessed hope,
I shall rest, sweetly rest over Jordan.
’Tis a blessed hope which my Savior gives,
I shall rest by and by over Jordan;
I shall see Him there in His mansion fair,
When I rest, sweetly rest over Jordan.
With a steadfast faith I will labor on,
I shall rest, sweetly rest over Jordan;
O what joy ’twill be the redeemed to see,
When I rest, sweetly rest, over Jordan.

When faint and weary toiling,
The sweat-drops on my brow,
I long to rest for labor,
To drop the burden now—
There comes a gentle chiding,
To quell each mourning sigh:
“Work while the day is shining,
There’s resting by and by."
Resting by and by,
There’s resting by and by;
We shall not always labor,
We shall not always cry;
The end is drawing nearer,
The end for which we sigh;
We’ll lay our heavy burdens down,
There’s resting by and by.
This life to toil is given,
And he improves it best
Who seeks by patient labor
To enter into rest;
Then pilgrim, worn and weary,
Press on, the goal is nigh;
The prize is straight before thee,
There’s resting by and by.
Nor ask when overburdened,
You long for friendly aid,
“Why idle stands my brother,
No yoke upon him laid?"
The Master bids him tarry;
And dare you ask Him why?
“Go labor in My vineyard,
There’s resting by and by."
Wan reaper in the harvest,
Let this thy strength sustain,
Each sheaf that fills the garner
Brings you eternal gain;
Then bear the cross with patience,
To fields of duty hie;
’Tis sweet to work for Jesus—
There’s resting by and by.

Resting from His work today
In the tomb the Savior lay;
Still He slept, from head to feet
Shrouded in the winding sheet,
Lying in the rock alone,
Hidden by the sealed stone.
Late at even there was seen
Watching long the Magdalene;
Early, ere the break of day,
Sorrowful she took her way
To the holy garden glade,
Where her buried Lord was laid.
So with Thee, till life shall end,
I would solemn vigil spend:
Let me hew Thee, Lord, a shrine
In this rocky heart of mine,
Where in pure embalmed cell,
None but Thou may ever dwell.
Myrrh and spices will I bring,
True affection’s offering;
Close the doors from sight and sound
Of the busy world around;
And in patient watch remain
Till my Lord appear again.

In the eye of the hurricane, I find peace in the storm.
By trusting in You, Lord, my soul is reborn.
Like a child in Your arms, safe and warm against the night,
You will bear me through the darkness, surrounded by Your light.
Resting in You, Lord, safe in Your arms,
Resting in You, Lord, I am safe in Your arms.
Though the mountains may crumble, and the sea roll away,
I know You are with me, through the night and the day.
For You’re right here inside me; yes, You live within my heart.
I’ve abandoned my life into Your gentle, loving arms.
When my burdens grow heavy, and I bend beneath the load,
Then Your strength will help me down the long, dusty road.
All my trials and tribulations, they can only make me strong.
For You lift my soul with gladness, and fill my heart with song.

Restore in us, O God,
the splendor of your love;
renew your image in our hearts,
and all our sins remove.
O Spirit, wake in us
the wonder of your power;
from fruitless fear unfurl our lives
like springtime bud and flower.
Bring us, O Christ, to share
the fullness of your joy;
baptize us in the risen life
that death cannot destroy.
Three-personed God, fulfill
the promise of your grace,
that we, when our searching ends,
may see you face to face.

In the resurrection morning
We will see the Savior coming,
And the sons of God a-shouting in the kingdom of the Lord.
When the trump of God shall sound,
When the trump of God shall sound,
It shall wake the sleeping nations,
When the trump of God shall sound!
The dead in Christ shall rise,
The dead in Christ shall rise.
We feel the advent glory
While the vision seems to tarry,
We will comfort one another with the words of Holy Writ.
By faith we can discover
That our warfare'll soon be over,
And we'll shortly hail each other on fair Heaven's happy shore.
We will tell the pleasing story
When we meet our friends in glory,
And we'll keep ourselves all ready for to hail the heav'nly King.

The day was dark, and all seemed lost when to the tomb
They bore the form of Christ the crucified.
Loved ones hoped that He would reign—
But their hopes were all in vain,
For they saw Him as upon the cross He died.
But there dawned a resurrection morn so fair,
When the Savior rose from out the tomb;
For the angels came and rolled the stone away,
And today is banished all earth’s gloom.
The stone before the door was set and firmly sealed—
A guard was placed to watch by night and day,
For they feared that from the dead
He would rise as He had said,
Or perchance His own would spirit Him away.
Oh, sad and lonely ones today, look up! rejoice!
The empty tomb with praises may resound,
Over mountain, hill and plain,
Let there ring the glad ,
Bringing hope and cheer wherever man is found.

Return to bless my waiting eyes,
And cheer my mourning heart, O Lord!
Without Thee, all beneath the skies
No real pleasure can afford.
When Thy loved presence meets my sight,
It softens care, and sweetens toil;
The sun shines forth with double light,
The whole creation wears a smile.
Upon thine arm of love I rest,
Thy gracious voice forbids my fear;
No storms disturb my peaceful breast,
No foes assault when Thou art near.
But ah! since Thou hast been away,
Nothing but trouble have I known;
And Satan marks me for his prey
Because he sees me left alone.
My sun is hid, my comforts lost,
My graces droop, my sins revive;
Distressed, dismayed, and tempest tossed,
My soul is only just alive!
Lord, hear my cry and come again!
Put all mine enemies to shame,
And let them see, ’tis not in vain
That I have trusted in Thy Name.

Return, O wanderer, return,
And seek an injured Father’s face;
Those warm desires that in thee burn
Were kindled by reclaiming grace.
Return, O wanderer, return,
And seek a Father’s melting heart,
Whose pitying eyes thy grief discern,
Whose hand can heal thine inward smart.
Return, O wanderer, return,
He heard thy deep repentant sigh,
He saw thy softened spirit mourn
When no intruding ear was nigh.
Return, O wanderer, return,
Thy Savior bids thy spirit live;
Go to His bleeding feet, and learn
How freely Jesus can forgive.
Return, O wanderer, return,
And wipe away the falling tear;
’Tis God who says, “No longer mourn,"
’Tis mercy’s voice invites thee near.

Return, O wanderer, to thy home,
Thy Father calls for thee;
No longer now an exile roam,
In guilt and misery:
Return, return!
Too long the loathsome fields of sin
Thy fruitless toil have known:
No wholesome bread! no voice of kin!
No home to call thine own!
Return, return!
Thy Father stands with outstretched hands,
He gave His Son for thee:
Poor soul, from sin’s enthralling bands
He longs to see thee free.
Return, return!
Arise, stand up and homeward turn,
No longer dwell apart;
His mighty love will never spurn
One humble contrite heart.
Return, return!
Our Father’s house is full of bliss,
And there is room for all;
He welcomes with forgiving kiss:
O, hear His loving call!
Return, return!
The feast of joys awaits thee there,
The precious robe and ring;
O haste Thy Father’s gifts to share,
O haste His praise to sing:
Return, return!

When we have a meeting to glorify the Lord,
How we love to worship His name in one accord;
But the thought of parting always brings us inward pain,
For we know not whether we’ll gather here again.
Some day we’ll meet together, the time is drawing nigh,
When we have our fam’ly reunion in the sky;
We’ll gather ’round the throne of God to never say goodbye,
When we reach our mansion prepared for us on high.
We will pray the Father to bless and keep each one
With the peace He gave us through His beloved Son;
If we never meet again this side of heaven’s shore,
He will keep us faithful and true forevermore.
We’ll keep pressing onward in unity and love,
Waiting for our summons that’s coming from above;
God will wipe away the tears from every weeping eye,
When we get to heaven there’ll be no sad goodbye.

God is here, and that to bless us
With the Spirit’s quick’ning power;
See, the cloud already bending,
Waits to drop the grateful shower.
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee,
Let the shower of blessing fall;
We are waiting, we are waiting,
Oh, revive the hearts of all.
God is here! we feel His presence
In this consecrated place;
But we need the soul refreshing
Of His free, unbounded grace.
God is here! oh, then, believing,
Bring to Him our one desire,
That His love may now be kindled,
Till its flame each heart inspire.
Savior, grant the prayer we offer,
While in simple faith we bow,
From the windows of Thy mercy
Pour us out a blessing now.

Revive Thy work, O Lord,
Thy mighty arm make bare;
Speak with the voice that wakes the dead,
And make Thy people hear.
Revive Thy work, O Lord,
Disturb this sleep of death;
Quicken the smold’ring embers now
By Thine almighty breath.
Revive Thy work, O Lord,
Create soul-thirst for Thee;
And hungering for the Bread of Life
O may our spirits be.
Revive Thy work, O Lord,
Exalt Thy precious Name;
And, by the Holy Ghost, our love
For Thee and Thine inflame.
Revive Thy work, O Lord,
Give Pentecostal showers;
The glory shall be all Thine own,
The blessing, Lord, be ours.

We praise Thee, O God!
For the Son of Thy love,
For Jesus Who died,
And is now gone above.
Hallelujah! Thine the glory.
Hallelujah! Amen.
Hallelujah! Thine the glory.
Revive us again.
We praise Thee, O God!
For Thy Spirit of light,
Who hath shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.
All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who hath borne all our sins,
And hath cleansed every stain.
All glory and praise
To the God of all grace,
Who hast brought us, and sought us,
And guided our ways.
Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above.

Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
Hark! all the tribes Hosanna cry;
O Savior meek, pursue Thy road
With palms and scattered garments strowed.
Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die!
O Christ! Thy triumph now begin
Over captive death and conquered sin.
Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
The winged squadrons of the sky
Look down with sad and wondering eyes
To see the approaching sacrifice.
Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh;
The Father, on His sapphire throne,
Expects His own anointed Son.
Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
Then take, O God, Thy power, and reign.

Just Hold on to Jesus.And Ride out your storm.
() Ride out your storm.GOd's right there with you.

Remember his promises.He said I'll never forsake
Though the waters are troubled.They'll do you no harm.
Don't give up the battle .For your answer is coming.
Just hold on to Jesus .And Ride out your storm.

Righteous Father, we have wronged Thee,
Underfoot Thy laws have cast:
Now we fain would serve Thee better,
O forgive us what is past.
Loving Jesus, we have hurt Thee,
Yielded to temptation’s blast:
Now we long to stand more firmly,
O forgive us what is past.
Holy Spirit, we have grieved Thee,
Sin and death have held us fast:
Now we yearn for life and freedom,
O forgive us what is past.
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
God eternal, first and last,
Penitent we kneel before Thee,
O forgive us all the past.

Righteous God! Whose vengeful phials
All our fears and thoughts exceed,
Big with woes and fiery trials,
Hanging, bursting o’er our head;
While Thou visitest the nations,
Thy selected people spare;
Arm our cautioned souls with patience,
Fill our humbled hearts with prayer.
If Thy dreadful controversy
With all flesh is now begun,
In Thy wrath remember mercy,
Mercy first and last be shown;
Plead Thy cause with sword and fire,
Shake us till the curse remove,
Till Thou com’st, the world’s Desire,
Conquering all with sovereign love.
Every fresh alarming token
More confirms the faithful Word;
Nature (for its Lord hath spoken)
Must be suddenly restored:
From this national confusion,
From this ruined earth and skies,
See the times of restitution,
See the new creation rise!
Vanish, then, this world of shadows,
Pass the former things away:
Lord, appear! appear to glad us
With the dawn of endless day
O conclude this mortal story,
Throw this universe aside!
Come, eternal King of glory,
Now descend, and take Thy bride!

Ring, merry bells, this day is born a King;
To the waiting shepherds angels sing;
With gifts of love they journey from afar,
Guided to the manger by the star.
Ring on, ye bells, ye merry bells,
Let sweetest anthems fill each heart with joy today;
Ring on, ye bells, ye merry bells,
Ring out the message clear,
Let all the nations hear,
Thy message brings to all good cheer,
This happy Christmas Day.
Ring, bells of Christmas! Merrily ye chime,
Send your notes of joy to every clime.
Drive out the darkness, set the burdened free,
Let the land resound with songs of glee.
Ring on, ye bells, there’s music everywhere,
In thy merry notes we’ll lose our care;
Free from all sorrow, hearts so light and gay,
Join we in thy praise, this Christmas day.

Ring out the bells for Christmas,
The happy, happy day;
In winter wild, the holy Child
Within the cradle lay.
O wonderful! the Savior
Is in the manger lone;
His palace is a stable,
And Mary’s arms His throne.
Ring out the bells for Christmas,
The merry, merry Christmas,
Ring out the bells for Christmas,
The happy, happy day.
On Beth’lem’s quiet hillside,
In ages long gone by,
In angel notes the glory floats,
“Glory to God on high."
Yet wakes the sun as joyous
As when the Lord was born,
And still He comes to greet you
On ev’ry Christmas morn.
Where’er His sweet lambs gather,
Within this gentle fold
The Savior dear is waiting near,
As in the days of old.
In each young heart you see Him,
In ev’ry guileless face,
You see the holy Jesus,
Who grew in truth and grace.
In many a darksome cottage,
In many a crowded street,
In winter bleak, with shiv’ring cheek,
The homeless child you meet.
Gaze upon the pale, wan features,
The feet with wand’ring sore.
You see the souls He loveth,
The Christ Child at the door.
Then sing your gladsome carols,
And hail the newborn Sun;
For Christmas light is passing bright,
It smiles on everyone;
And feast Christ’s little children,
His poor, his orphans call,
For He Who chose the manger,
He loveth one and all.

Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
for those that here we see no more;
ring out the feud of rich and poor,
ring in redress to all mankind.
Ring out the slowly dying cause,
and ancient forms of party strife;
ring in the nobler modes of life,
with sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out false pride in place and blood,
the civic slander and the spite;
ring in the love of truth and right,
ring in the common love of good.
Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
ring out the thousand wars of old,
ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
the larger heart, the kindlier hand;
ring out the darkness of the land,
ring in the Christ that is

Ring out the old, ring in the new,
Ring, happy bells, across the snow;
The year is going, let him go;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light:
The year is dying in the night;
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
For those that here we see no more;
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress to all mankind.
Ring out false pride in place and blood,
The civic slander and the spite;
Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love of good.
Ring out a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forms of party strife,
Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweet manners, purer laws.
Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land,
Ring in the Christ that is to be.

Ring the bells of Heaven! There is joy today,
For a soul, returning from the wild!
See, the Father meets him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary, wandering child.
Glory! Glory! How the angels sing:
Glory! Glory! How the loud harps ring!
’Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.
Ring the bells of Heaven! There is joy today,
For the wanderer now is reconciled;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
And is born anew a ransomed child.
Ring the bells of Heaven! Spread the feast today!
Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tidings, bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again.

Ring, ye chiming bells, your gladsome story,
At this happy time, this wondrous Easter time!
Telling how the King arose in glory,
Ring your sweetest chime, your glad triumphant chime.
Ring, ye bells! ring as dawn appeareth!
Ring, oh ring, for the angels bright
Came to tell news that ever cheereth
All the pilgrims who seek the light.
Ever, as you chime the Easter gladness,
Out of distant years, yea, out of silent years,
Cometh still the balm for earthly sadness,
Calm for earthly fears and joy for earthly tears.
Look! we almost seem to see the shining
Of the angel bright, in glorious robes of light!
Hark! he saith, “The One in death reclining,
Hath aris’n in might, aris’n in pow’r and might!"

Ring, happy bells of Easter time,
The world is glad to hear your chime;
Across wide fields of melting snow
The winds of summer softly blow,
And birds and streams Of Easter time, of Easter time:
The world is glad to hear your chime;
Ring, happy bells of Easter time!
Ring, happy bells of Easter time,
The world takes up your chant sublime;
The Lord is risen, the night of fear
Has passed away and heaven draws near:
We breathe the air of that blest clime,
At Easter time, at Easter time:
Ring, happy bells of Easter time,
Our happy hearts give back your chime;
The Lord is risen, we die no more:
He opens wide the heavenly door;
He meets us, while to Him we climb,
At Easter time, at Easter time:

Ring out the bells for Christmas,
The happy, happy day;
In winter wild, the holy Child
Within the cradle lay.
O wonderful! the Savior
Is in the manger lone;
His palace is a stable,
And Mary’s arms His throne.
Ring out the bells for Christmas,
The merry, merry Christmas,
Ring out the bells for Christmas,
The happy, happy day.
On Beth’lem’s quiet hillside,
In ages long gone by,
In angel notes the glory floats,
“Glory to God on high."
Yet wakes the sun as joyous
As when the Lord was born,
And still He comes to greet you
On ev’ry Christmas morn.
Where’er His sweet lambs gather,
Within this gentle fold
The Savior dear is waiting near,
As in the days of old.
In each young heart you see Him,
In ev’ry guileless face,
You see the holy Jesus,
Who grew in truth and grace.
In many a darksome cottage,
In many a crowded street,
In winter bleak, with shiv’ring cheek,
The homeless child you meet.
Gaze upon the pale, wan features,
The feet with wand’ring sore.
You see the souls He loveth,
The Christ Child at the door.
Then sing your gladsome carols,
And hail the newborn Sun;
For Christmas light is passing bright,
It smiles on everyone;
And feast Christ’s little children,
His poor, his orphans call,
For He Who chose the manger,
He loveth one and all.

Rise, and shine, and give God his glory, glory,
Rise, and shine, and give God his glory, glory,
Rise, and shine, and give God his glory, glory,
Children of the Lord.
The Lord said to Noah: 'There's gonna be a floody, floody.'
The Lord said to Noah: 'There's gonna be a floody, floody.
Get those children out of the muddy, muddy,
Children of the Lord.'
The Lord told Noah to build him an arky, arky,
The Lord told Noah to build him an arky, arky,
Build it out of gopher barky, barky,
Children of the Lord.
The animals, the animals, they came on, by twosies, twosies,
The animals, the animals, they came on, by twosies, twosies,
Elephants and kangaroosies, 'roosies,
Children of the Lord.
It rained and poured for forty daysies, daysies,
It rained and poured for forty daysies, daysies,
Almost drove those animals crazies, crazies,
Children of the Lord.
The sun came out and dried up the landy, landy,
The sun came out and dried up the landy, landy,
Everything was fine and dandy, dandy,
Children of the Lord.

Rise at the cry of battle,
Arm for the coming strife,
By night and day you must fight your way
Till you pass through death to life.
Ready to face the danger,
Ready to right the wrong,
There is many a foe on the way you go,
Quit you like men, be strong!
Fiery and fierce the conflict,
Daring and swift the foe;
His hosts are found on the battle ground,
Where they wait to lay you low;
Sharp are his darts and deadly,
Keen is the strife and long,
Then arm for the fight in the armor of light,
Quit you like men, be strong!
Strive till the strife is over,
Fight till the fight is won,
Though sore oppressed, seek not for rest,
Until the day is done;
After the well fought battle
Join in the victor’s song,
Your trophies bring to Christ your King,
Quit you like men, be strong!

“Rise from your graves, ye dead!" Thus shall the call be sounded,
Which on the latter day shall find us all astounded;
Which to the faithful flock shall promise rare delight,
And fill the trembling hearts of sinners with affright.
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!" Your sleep at last is over,
Ye blessed of the Lord, no more without shall hover.
The garments are prepared, the crowns for you are stored,
Enter into the joy and comfort of your Lord!
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!" Come from your earthly cover;
Ye wicked all the pangs of hell shall now discover.
Ye once rejected Me, I hold you nothing worth;
Wailing and gnashing teeth shall be your lot henceforth.
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!" Lo, here are bone and tissue
Flesh, sinew, hands, eye, foot! from earth and air they issue.
That wherewith you have served the Lord is glorified,
That wherewith you have sinned, consumed and cast aside.
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!" Ye faithful now shall glory
In halos like the sun, undimmed, untransitory.
Immortal bodies with immortal souls shall blend,
Ye shall enjoy the rest of saints that hath no end.

Rise in the strength of God,
And face life’s uphill way,
The steps which other feet have trod
You tread today.
Press onward, upward still,
To win your way at last,
With better hope and stronger will
Than in the past.
Life’s work more nobly wrought,
Life’s race more bravely run,
Life’s daily conflict faced and fought,
Life’s duty done.

Rise! To arms! With prayer employ you,
O Christians, lest the Foe destroy you,
For Satan has designed your fall.
Wield God's Word, a weapon glorious!
Against each foe you'll be victorious;
Our God will set you o'er them all.
Is Satan strong and fell?
Here is Immanuel.
Sing hosanna!
The strong ones yield,
With Christ our Shield,
And we as conqueror's hold the field.
Cast afar this world's vain pleasures,
Aye, boldly fight for heavenly treasures,
And steadfast be in Jesus' might.
He will help, whate'er betide you,
And naught will harm with Christ beside you;
By faith you'll conquer in the fight.
Then shame, thou weary soul!
Look forward to the goal:
There joy waits thee.
The race, then, run;
The combat done,
Thy crown of glory will be won.
Wisely fight, for time is fleeting,
The hours of grace are fast retreating;
Short, short, is this our earthly way.
Then the trump the dead is waking
And sinners all with fear are quaking,
With joy the saints will greet that Day.
Bless God, our triumph's sure,
Tho' long we did endure
Scorn and trial.
Thou, Son of God,
To Thine abode
Wilt lead the way Thyself hast trod.
Jesus, all Thy children cherish
And keep them that they never perish
Whom Thou hast purchased with Thy blood.
Let new life to us be given
That we may look to Thee in heaven
Whenever fearful is our mood.
Thy spirit on us pour
That we may love Thee more--
Hearts o'erflowing;
And then will we 
Be true to Thee
In death and life eternally.Amen.

Rise up and shine! Your light has come;
God's glory breaks like dawn.
For though the earth be cloaked in night
and gloom shrouds everyone,
yet over you the Lord will rise,
with glory gleaming clear,
till nations turn to seek your light
and humbled kings draw near.
Fling wide your gates, both day and night;
no more keep watch or guard.
You will be called God's holy hill,
the city of the Lord.
No sound of strife will plague your land,
nor harm besiege your ways;
"Salvation" will you name your walls,
and all your portals "Praise."
No more will you implore the sun
to shed by day its light,
nor will you need the changeful moon
to glisten through the night.
Your glory then will be your God,
whose light will never cease.
Rise up and shine! Your light has come
to give you joy and peace.

Rise up, O men of God!
Have done with lesser things.
Give heart and mind and soul and strength
To serve the King of kings.
Rise up, O men of God!
The kingdom tarries long.
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong.
Rise up, O men of God!
The church for you doth wait,
Her strength unequal to her task;
Rise up and make her great!
Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where His feet have trod.
As brothers of the Son of Man,
Rise up, O men of God!

There’s a star in the East on Christmas morn,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
It will lead to the place where the Christ was born,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
Follow, follow, rise up, shepherd, and follow.
Follow the Star of Bethlehem,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
If you take good heed to the angel’s words,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
You’ll forget your flocks, you’ll forget your herds,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

Rise, arise! Rise, arise!
Zion, rise to greet thy King!
Open wide the gates before Him!
Let the glad hosannas ring!
Haste to worship and adore Him!
Hark, the watchman on the mountain cries:
“Rise, arise! Rise, arise!"
Weep no more! Weep no more!
Zion, dry thy bitter tears!
Cast away all gloom and sadness,
For the Shiloh now appears,
Who shall turn thy grief to gladness!
Day has dawned! Arise! the night is o’er!
Weep no more! Weep no more!
O rejoice! O rejoice!
Christ doth come, as long foretold!
The Messiah long expected,
The incarnate Word behold!
Though by kings of earth rejected,
Hail Him Lord of all with mighty voice!
O rejoice! O rejoice!
Crown Him King! Crown Him King!
His exalted Name confess!
From His heavenly throne descending,
Jesus, Lord of righteousness,
Bringeth joy and peace unending!
O let heart and tongue His praises sing!
Crown Him King! Crown Him King!
Worship Him! Worship Him!
Worship at His sacred feet!
Hail the Son of God thy Savior!
Haste, thy longed for Bridegroom greet!
Come, receive His kingly favor!
Zion, haste thy lamp of faith to trim!
Worship Him! Worship Him!

Rise, crowned with light, imperial Salem, rise!
Exalt thy towering Head and lift thine eyes!
See Heav’n its sparkling portals wide display,
And break upon thee in a flood of day!
See a long race thy spacious courts adorn;
See future sons, and daughters yet unborn,
In crowding ranks on every side arise,
Demanding life, impatient for the skies.
See barbarous nations at Thy gates attend,
Walk in Thy light, and in Thy temple bend:
See Thy bright altars thronged with prostrate kings,
While every land its joyous tribute brings.
The seas shall waste, the skies in smoke decay,
Rocks fall to dust, and mountains melt away;
But fixed His Word, His saving power remains;
Thy realm shall last, Thy own Messiah reigns!

Rise, glorious Conqueror, rise,
Into Thy native skies;
Assume Thy right;
And where in many a fold
The clouds are backward rolled
Pass through those gates of gold,
And reign in light!
Victor o’er death and hell!
Cherubic legions swell!
Thy radiant train;
Praises all heaven inspire;
Each angel sweeps his lyre.
And waves his wings of fire—
Thou Lamb once slain!
Enter, incarnate God!
No feet but Thine have trod
The serpent down:
Blow the full trumpets blow!
Wider your portals throw!
Savior triumphant, go
And take Thy crown!
Lion of Judah! Hail!
And let Thy Name prevail
From age to age;
Lord of the rolling years,
Claim for Thine own the spheres,
For Thou hast bought with tears
Thy heritage!
And then was heard afar
Star answering to star—
“Lo! these have come
Followers of Him Who gave
His life their lives to save;
And now their palms they wave,
Brought safely home."

Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, thy better portion trace;
Rise from transitory things, towards heaven, thy destined place:
Sun and moon and stars decay, time shall soon this earth remove;
Rise, my soul, and haste away to seats prepared above.
Rivers to the ocean run, nor stay in all their course;
Fire ascending seeks the sun; both speed them to their source:
So my soul, derived from God, longs to view His glorious face,
Forward tends to His abode, to rest in His embrace.
Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn, press onward to the prize;
Soon thy Savior will return, to take thee to the skies:
There is everlasting peace, rest, enduring rest, in heaven;
There will sorrow ever cease, and crowns of joy be given.

Rise, Thou Light of Gentile nations,
Jesus, bright and Morning Star;
Let Thy Word, the gladsome tidings,
Ring out loudly near and far,
Bringing freedom to the captives,
Peace and comfort to the slave,
That the heathen, free from bondage,
May proclaim Thy power to save.
See the blindness of the heathen,
Strangers to Thy glorious light,
Straying hopeless till they find Thee,
Wandering aimless in the night.
See their pitiful condition;
Lo, gross darkness covers all,
And no ray of hope refreshes
Nor dispels the dreadful pall.
If Thou, merciful Redeemer,
Hadst not saved us from this plight,
In like darkness we would languish
Hopeless, helpless, in sin’s night.
Lovingly Thou, Lord, didst seek us
In the beauty of Thy grace;
Now with joy we freely serve Thee,
We, Thy blessed, chosen race.
Knowing Thee and Thy salvation,
Grateful love dare never cease
To proclaim Thy tender mercies,
Gracious Lord, Thy heavenly peace.
Sound we forth the Gospel tidings
To the earth’s remotest bound
That the sinner has been pardoned
And forgiveness can be found.

Rise, ye children of salvation,
All who cleave to Christ the Head;
Wake, awake, O mighty nation,
Ere the foe on Zion tread;
He draws nigh, and would defy
All the hosts of God most high.
Saints and martyrs long before us
Firmly on this ground have stood;
See their banner waving o’er us,
Conquerors through the Savior’s blood.
Ground we hold, whereon of old,
Fought the faithful and the bold.
Fighting, we shall be victorious
By the blood of Christ our Lord;
On our foreheads, bright and glorious,
Shines the witness of His Word;
Spear and shield on battlefield,
His great Name; we cannot yield.
When His servants stand before Him
Each receiving his reward,
When His saints in light adore Him,
Giving glory to the Lord;
“Victory!" our song shall be
Like the thunder of the sea.

Rites cannot change the heart,
Undo the evil done,
Or with the uttered name impart
The nature of Thy Son.
To meet our desperate want,
There gushed a crimson flood;
O from His heart’s o’erflowing font
Baptize this soul with blood!
Be grace from Christ our Lord,
And love from God supreme,
By the communing Spirit poured
In a perpetual stream!

The river of Thy grace is flowing free,
We launch upon its depths to sail to Thee;
In the ocean of Thy love we soon shall be,
We are sailing to eternity.
Earthly joys cannot compare with all the glory,
When our longing eyes shall see Thy face;
We shall have Thy fellowship forever,
In the splendor of the throne of grace.
The breezes of Thy love are blowing free,
They tell Thy love to all humanity;
They are singing of the blood of Calvary,
Making white through all eternity.
Thy Spirit calls to all, “Come home today";
Come back and find the Savior while you may;
Find that Jesus is the Life, the Truth, the Way,
Leading, guiding to eternity.

There's a river of life flowing out of me,
Makes the lame to walk and the blind to see.
Open prison door sets the captive free,
There's a river of life flowing out of me.
Spring up oh well.gush, gush, gush, gush
Within my soul!
Spring up oh well.Splish, Splash!
And make me whole.
Spring up oh well.ahhh-whoosh!
And give to me.
That life abundantly.
There's a fountain flowing from the Savior's side,
All my sin's forgiven in the precious tide;
Jesus paid the price when for me He died,
There's a fountain flowing from the Savior's side.
There's a risen Savior at the Father's throne,
Ever interceding for His very own;
Pouring down the blessings that are His alone,
There's a risen Savior at the Father's throne.

I’ll sing of a river divine,
Its waters from trouble release;
More precious than “honey and wine,"
That river, sweet river is peace.
Oh, this river of peace
Makes me perfect and whole;
And its blessings increase,
Flowing deep in my soul.
It reaches from heaven to earth,
It issues from under the throne;
Great peace! oh, thy infinite worth!
Sweet peace in my Jesus alone.
Oh, wonderful life-giving flood,
Thy waters so crystal and pure
Make glad all the “City of God";
Forever thy blessings endure.
Oh, Jesus, the tempest of sin
Is hushed into heavenly rest,
Since tasting the pure, living stream
That flows from Thy crucified breast.
My moments as angels appear,
All gliding so gently along;
Each dropping a blessing so rare,
Enraptures my soul with a song..

The river of Thy grace is flowing free,
We launch upon its depths to sail to Thee;
In the ocean of Thy love we soon shall be,
We are sailing to eternity.
Earthly joys cannot compare with all the glory,
When our longing eyes shall see Thy face;
We shall have Thy fellowship forever,
In the splendor of the throne of grace.
The breezes of Thy love are blowing free,
They tell Thy love to all humanity;
They are singing of the blood of Calvary,
Making white through all eternity.
Thy Spirit calls to all, “Come home today";
Come back and find the Savior while you may;
Find that Jesus is the Life, the Truth, the Way,
Leading, guiding to eternity.

In thy clear, transparent glow,
Peaceful, cleansing river,
In thy sparkling beauty flow
O’er my heart forever.
By thy shore, oh, let me be,
Soul refining river;
Ever let me drink of thee,
Thirst no more forever.
There is music in thy wave,
Calmest, purest river;
In thy waters let me bathe
Ever and forever.
In thy bosom’s crystal sea,
Gentle, tranquil river,
Let my spirit’s image be
Mirrored there forever.
There behold life’s fragrant tree
Blooming by the river;
’Neath its shade my walk shall be
Ever and forever.

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure;
Save from wrath and make me pure.
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to the cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
[originally When my eye-strings break in death]
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

Rock of Ages, let our song
Praise Thy saving power;
Thou, amidst the raging foes,
Wast our sheltering tower.
Furious they assailed us,
But Thine arm availed us,
And Thy Word
Broke their sword
When our own strength failed us.
Kindling new the holy lamps,
Priests, approved in suffering,
Purified the nation’s shrine,
Brought to God their offering.
And His courts surrounding
Hear, in joy abounding,
Happy throngs,
Singing songs
With a mighty sounding.
Children of the martyr race,
Whether free or fettered,
Wake the echoes of the songs
Where ye may be scattered.
Yours the message cheering
That the time is nearing
Which will see
All men free,
Tyrants disappearing.

Oh! sometimes the shadows are deep,
And rough seems the path to the goal,
And sorrows, sometimes how they sweep
Like tempests down over the soul.
O then to the Rock let me fly
To the Rock that is higher than I
O then to the Rock let me fly
To the Rock that is higher than I!
Oh! sometimes how long seems the day,
And sometimes how weary my feet!
But toiling in life’s dusty way,
The Rock’s blessed shadow, how sweet!
Then near to the Rock let me keep
If blessings or sorrows prevail,
Or climbing the mountain way steep,
Or walking the shadowy vale.

Rockabye Jesus sweet,
Close will I hold Thee,
As Mary's loving arms
Then did enfold Thee.
Rockabye Jesus,
My soul's fairest treasure,
Rockabye Jesus,
My love knows no measure.
See how the world lies
In sorrow and sadness;
Give us Thy blessing,
O bring Heaven's gladness!
Rockabye Jesus,
My soul's fairest treasure,
Rockabye Jesus,
My love knows no measure.

Rocked in the cradle of the deep,
I lay me down in peace to sleep;
Secure I rest upon the wave,
For Thou, O Lord, hast power to save.
I know Thou wilt not slight my call,
For Thou dost mark the sparrow’s fall.
And calm and peaceful is my sleep,
Rocked in the cradle of the deep;
And calm and peaceful is my sleep,
Rocked in the cradle of the deep.
And such the trust that still were mine,
Though stormy winds sweep o’er the brine,
Or though the tempest’s fiery breath
Rouse me from sleep to wreck and death,
In ocean cave still safe with Thee,
The germ of immortality.

Little Jesus, sweetly sleep, do not stir;
We will lend a coat of fur.
We will rock you, rock you, rock you,
We will rock you, rock you, rock you.
See the fur to keep you warm,
Snugly 'round your tiny form.
Mary's little baby, sleep, sweetly sleep,
Sleep in comfort, slumber deep.
We will rock you, rock you, rock you,
We will rock you, rock you, rock you.
We will serve you all we can,
Darling, darling little man.

Roll on, though mighty ocean!
And, as thy billows flow,
Bear messengers of mercy
To every land below.
Arise, ye gales, and waft them
Safe to the destined shore;
That man may sit in darkness,
And death’s black shade no more.
O Thou eternal Ruler,
Who holdest in Thine arm
The tempests of the ocean,
Protect them from all harm!
Thy presence, Lord, be with them,
Wherever they may be;
Though far from us who love them,
Still let them be with Thee.

Roll out, O song to God!
Move on, ye throngs of men!
Chances and changes come and go;
God changeth not! Amen.
And on the throngs of men,
On worrying care and strife,
Sinks down, as if from angel tongues,
The word of hope and life.
Down in the darksome ways
And worrying whirl of life
Sinks, like a strain of vesper song,
The thought of His great strife;
Who, of the virgin born,
Made all our chains His own,
And broke them with His own right arm,
Nor left us more alone.
Amid the weak, One strong,
Amid the false, One true,
Amid all change, One changing not,
One hope we ne’er shall rue.
In Whose sight all is now,
In Whose love all is best:
The things of this world pass away,
Come, let us in Him rest.

And without becoming weak in faith
He contemplated his own body
Now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old
And the deadness of Sara's womb
But with respect to the promise of God
He did not waiver in unbelief
But grew strong in faith giving glory to God
And being fully assured that what He had promised
He was able also to perform
Therefore it was reckoned unto him as righteousness
O o o o o o o

I am convinced death nor life
Neither angels nor demons
Not the present nor the future
Nor any other power, height nor depth
Not anything in all creation
Not anything in all creation
Not anything in all creation
Shall keep us from the love of our God
That is in Jesus Christ our Lord
That is in Jesus Christ our Lord
Nothing shall separate us from the love of God
Nothing shall separate us from the love of God
Nothing shall separate us from the love of God
Nothing at all

The cross upon which Jesus died
Is a shelter in which we can hide
And its grace so free is sufficient for me
And deep is its fountain as wide as the sea.
There's room at the cross for you
There's room at the cross for you
Though millions have come, there's still room for one
Yes there's room at the cross for you.
Though millions have found him a friend
And have turned from the sins they have sinned
The Savior still waits to open the gates
And welcome a sinner before it's too late.
The hand of my Savior is strong
And the love of my Savior is long
Through sunshine or rain, through loss or in gain,
The blood flows from Calvary to cleanse every stain.

Is there any room for Jesus?
He Who died on Calvary,
He Who standeth, knocking, waiting,
Pleading with you tenderly.
Room for Jesus, room for Jesus,
Let Him in your heart today,
Throwing every window open,
O receive Him while you may.
We have room for worldly pleasures,
Cares of life crowd every day,
And our hearts and minds are burdened
While the Lord is turned away.
Will you not make room for Jesus,
For the Christ, the Crucified?
Is there not some place to enter
In the soul for which He died?
Room and time and thought for Jesus,
Hasten to accept His grace
Ere the heart grows cold and careless,
And His pleading voice shall cease.

Room for the penitent, burdened with sin,
Room at the open door—let him come in;
Weary and tempest tossed, where can he flee?
Jesus, Thou Lamb of God, only to Thee.
Room for the penitent; where can he flee?
Jesus, Thou Lamb of God, only to Thee.
Room where the living stream flows at His feet,
Room at the throne of grace—God’s mercy seat;
There may the broken heart lose all its grief,
There may the contrite soul find sweet relief.
Room at the blessed feast God has prepared,
Room where the bread of life millions have shared;
Room where the smiles of love tenderly fall;
Room in Thy arms, O Christ, room, room for all.

There is room in the fold of the Shepherd
For those who have wandered away;
There is room in the heart of the Savior
For every poor sinner today.
Room, room, room for you,
In the heart of the Savior above;
Room for me, room for you,
Come, rest in His wonderful love.
There is room in the field of the Master
And work for His servants to do;
A use for each talent He gives you,
A sheaf to be garnered by you.
There is room in the ranks of the Captain
For soldiers to fight against sin;
And all who are trustful and faithful
Thro’ Him will the victory win.
There is room in the beautiful City,
And Jesus has opened the door;
He will gather the least of His children
Where sorrow shall come nevermore.

Rorate coeli desuper!
Heavens, distil your balmy showers;
For now is risen the bright Daystar,
From the rose Mary, flower of flowers:
The clear Sun, whom no cloud devours,
Surmounting Phoebus in the east,
Is comen of His heav’nly towers,
Et nobis puer natus est.
Sinners be glad, and penance do,
And thank your Maker heartfully;
For He that ye might not come to,
To you is comen, fully humbly,
Your soules with His blood to buy,
And loose you of the fiend’s arrest,
And only of His own mercy;
Pro nobis puer natus est.
Celestial fowles in the air,
Sing with your notes upon the height,
In firthes and in forests fair
Be mirthful now at all your might;
For passed is your dully night;
Aurora has the cloudes pierced,
The sun is risen with gladsome light,
Et nobis puer natus est.
Sing, heaven imperial, most of height,
Regions of air make harmony,
All fish in flood and fowl of flight,
Be mirthful and make melody;
All Gloria in excelsis cry,
Heaven, earth, sea, man, bird and beast;
He that is crowned above the sky
Pro nobis puer natus est.

Rose of the cross, thou mystic flower
I lift my heart to thee:
In ev'ry melancholy hour;
O, Mary! remember me!
In ev'ry melancholy hour, O, Mary!
O, Mary! remember me.
A wand'rer here, thro' many_a wild,
Where few their way can see
Bloom with thy fragrance on thy child;
O, Mary! remember me!
Bloom with thy fragrance on thy child; O, Mary!
O, Mary! remember me.
Let me but stand where thou hast stood,
Beside the crimson tree;
And by the water and the blood;
O, Mary! remember me!
And by the water and the blood, O, Mary!
O, Mary! remember me.
There let me wash my sinful soul,
And be from sin set free;
Drawn by thy love, by grace made whole;
O, Mary! remember me!
Drawn by thy love, by grace made whole; O, Mary!
O, Mary! remember me.
Be thy blest son my all in all,
To whom for life I flee;
And when before His feet I fall
O, Mary! remember me!
And when before His feet I fall; O, Mary!
O, Mary! remember me.

What is sweeter, tell me,
Than a pretty rose?
Fragrant in its beauty,
Loveliest flow’r that grows.
Rose, rose, rose,
Prettiest flow’r that grows,
Emblem of love that came from heaven,
Through which a Savior, Christ, was given;
Rose, rose, rose,
Not till the whole world knows
Of my dear Savior King,
Will I cease to sing,
Sweet rose, rose, rose.
If a rose could whisper,
Could it, think you, tell
Of that blessed country
Where the angels dwell? 
Jesus, keep me ever
Like unto this flow’r—
Pure and sweet and modest,
Every day and hour.

The roseate hues of early dawn, the brightness of the day,
The crimson of the sunset sky, how fast they fade away!
O for the pearly gates of Heav’n! O for the golden floor!
O for the Sun of Righteousness that setteth nevermore!
The highest hopes we cherish here, how fast they tire and faint!
How many a spot defiles the robe that wraps an earthly saint!
O for a heart that never sins! O for a soul washed white!
O for a voice to praise our King, nor weary day or night!
Here faith is ours, and heavenly hopes, and grace to lead us higher;
But there are perfectness and peace beyond our best desire.
O by Thy love and anguish, Lord, O by Thy life laid down,
Grant that we fall not from Thy grace, nor cast away our crown!

Round me falls the night; Savior, be my Light:
Through the hours in darkness shrouded
Let me see Thy face unclouded,;
Let Thy glory shine in this heart of mine.
Earthly work is done, earthly sounds are none;
Rest in sleep and silence seeking,
Let my hear Thee softly speaking;
In my spirit’s ear whisper “I am near."
Darkened now each ray o’er the traveler’s way;
Let me know that Thou hast found me,
Let me feel Thine arms around me,
Sure from every ill Thou wilt guard me still.
Blessed heavenly Light, shining through earth’s night;
Voice, that oft of love hast told me;
Arms, so strong to clasp and hold me;
Thou Thy watch wilt keep, Savior, o’er my sleep.

Round the Lord in glory seated,
Cherubim and seraphim
Filled His temple, and repeated
Each to each the alternate hymn:
“Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
Earth is with its fullness stored;
Unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!"
Heav’n is still with glory ringing,
Earth takes up the angels’ cry,
“Holy, holy, holy," singing,
“Lord of Hosts, the Lord most high."
With His seraph train before Him,
With His holy church below,
Thus conspire we to adore him,
Bid we thus our anthem flow.
“Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
Earth is with its fullness stored;
Unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!"
Thus Thy glorious Name confessing,
We adopt thine angels’ cry,
“Holy, holy, holy," blessing
Thee, the Lord of Hosts most high.

Round the Sacred City gather
Egypt, Edom, Babylon;
All the warring hosts of error,
Sworn against her, move as one:
Vain the leaguer! her foundations
Are upon the holy hills,
And the love of the Eternal
All her stately temple fills.
Get thee, watchman, to the rampart!
Gird thee, warrior, with thy sword!
Be ye strong as ye remember
That amidst you is the Lord:
Like the night mists from the valley,
These shall vanish one by one,
Egypt’s malice, Edom’s envy,
And the hate of Babylon.
But be true, ye sons and daughters,
Lest the peril be within:
Watch to prayer, lest, while ye slumber,
Stealthy foemen enter in:
Safe the mother and the children,
In their will and love be strong,
While their loyal hearts go singing
Prayer and praise for battle song.
Church of God! if we forget thee
Let His blessings fail our hand,
When our love shall not prefer thee
Let His love forget our land—
Nay! to thee shall we be steadfast,
Though the world’s foundations shake,
Love of thee is love for ever,
Love of thee for Jesus’ sake.
Church of Christ! upon thy banner,
Lo, His passion’s awful sign;
By that seal of His redemption
Thou art His, and He is thine:
From the depth of His atonement
Flows thy sacramental tide:
From the height of His ascension
Flows the grace which is thy guide.
God the Spirit dwells within thee,
His society divine,
His the living Word thou keepest,
His thy apostolic line.
Ancient prayer and song liturgic,
Creeds that change not to the end,
As His gift we have received them,
As His charge we will defend.
Alleluia, alleluia,
To the Father, Spirit, Son,
In Whose will the Church at warfare
With the Church at rest is one;
So to Thee we sing in union,
God in earth and Heav’n adored,
Alleluia, alleluia,
Holy, holy, holy Lord.

The royal banners forward go,
The cross shines forth in mystic glow;
Where He in flesh, our flesh Who made,
Our sentence bore, our ransom paid.
Where deep for us the spear was dyed,
Life’s torrent rushing from His side,
To wash us in that precious flood,
Where mingled water flowed, and blood.
Fulfilled is all that David told
In true prophetic song of old,
Amidst the nations, God, saith he,
Hath reigned and triumphed from the tree.
O tree of beauty, tree of light!
O tree with royal purple dight!
Elect on whose triumphal breast
Those holy limbs should find their rest.
Blest tree, whose chosen branches bore
The wealth that did the world restore,
The price of humankind to pay,
And spoil the spoiler of his prey.
Upon its arms, like balance true,
He weighed the price for sinners due,
The price which none but He could pay,
And spoiled the spoiler of his prey.
O cross, our one reliance, hail!
Still may thy power with us avail
To give new virtue to the saint,
And pardon to the penitent.
To Thee, eternal Three in One,
Let homage meet by all be done:
As by the cross Thou dost restore,
So rule and guide us evermore.

Central’s never “busy," always on the line;
You may hear from Heaven almost any time;
’Tis a royal service, free for one and all;
When you get in trouble, give this royal line a call.
Telephone to glory, O what joy divine!
I can feel the current moving on the line,
Built by God the Father for His loved and own,
We may talk to Jesus thru this royal telephone.
There will be no charges, telephone is free,
It was built for service, just for you and me;
There will be no waiting on this royal line,
Telephone to glory always answers just in time.
Fail to get the answer, Satan’s crossed your wire,
By some strong delusion, or some base desire;
Take away obstructions, God is on the throne,
And you’ll get your answer thru this royal telephone.
If your line is “grounded," and connection true
Has been lost with Jesus, tell you what to do;
Prayer and faith and promise, mend the broken wire,
’Till your soul is burning with the Pentecostal fire.
Carnal combinations cannot get control
Of this line to glory, anchored in the soul;
Storm and trial cannot disconnect the line,
Held in constant keeping by the Father’s hand divine.

Ruler of the hosts of light,
Death hath yielded to Thy might;
And Thy blood hath marked a road
Which will lead us back to God.
From Thy dwelling place above,
From Thy Father’s throne of love,
With Thy look of mercy bless
Those without Thee comfortless.
Bitter were Thy throes on earth,
Giving to the Church her birth
From the spear wound opening wide
In Thine own life giving side.
Now in glory Thou dost reign
Won by all Thy toil and pain;
Thence the promised Spirit send
While our prayers to Thee ascend.
Jesu, praise to Thee be giv’n
With the Father high in Heav’n;
Holy Spirit, praise to Thee,
Now and through eternity.

Rulers of Sodom! hear the voice 
Of Heav’n’s eternal Lord; 
Men of Gomorrah! bend your ear 
Submissive to His Word.
’Tis thus He speaks; to what intent 
Are your oblations vain? 
Why load My altars with your gifts, 
Polluted and profane?
Burnt offerings long may blaze to Heav’n, 
And incense cloud the skies; 
The worship and the worshipper 
Are hateful in My eyes.
Your rites, your fasts, your prayers, I scorn, 
And pomp of solemn days: 
I know your hearts are full of guile, 
And crooked are your ways.
But cleanse your hands, ye guilty race, 
And cease from deeds of sin; 
Learn in your actions to be just, 
And pure in heart within.
Mock not My Name with honors vain, 
But keep My holy laws; 
Do justice to the friendless poor,
And plead the widow’s cause.
Then, though your guilty souls are stained 
With sins of crimson dye, 
Yet, through My grace with snow itself 
In whiteness they shall vie.

I was bound by sin and evil
From which there seemed no retrieval—
I could not do aught to cast its control;
But a Savior’s wondrous power
Caused the hosts of sin to cower,
And in love He came and rescued my soul.
Hallelujah! I am singing,
In my heart such joy is springing,
I’ve a peace this world can never destroy;
I am on my way to glory,
I will sing the wondrous story,
For my cup is running over with joy! 
In my heart a root was hidden,
Harbored foes fought fierce unbidden,
For deliverance from self I did cry;
Jesus died to make me holy,
And He showed the way so lowly,
Then my heart the altar did purify.
There are trials and temptations,
There are life’s great complications,
But there’s One who’s gained the vict’ry for me;
When the battle’s raging stronger,
And its seems I can’t last longer,
He’ll uphold me through till Satan must flee.
I’m rejoicing on the highway,
For it is the Lord’s not my way,
I’ll go trusting Him, whatever He’s planned;
In the Vine I am abiding,
He abides within, providing,
He is guiding to that wonderful land.

See the storm raging in fury today,
Out on life’s ocean still drifting away;
Loved ones are tossed on the billows, we know,
Then, rush to the rescue and never say no.
Rush to the rescue! Rush to the rescue!
Rush to the rescue though danger betide;
Rush to the rescue! Rush to the rescue!
Rush to the rescue with arms open wide.
See the dark waters with waves rolling high?
Wrecked on its billows, the helpless now lie;
Who dare with courage to stem the strong tide,
And rush to the rescue with arms open wide? 
Come now with courage and brave the rough sea,
Our trusty Captain will pilot for thee,
Save the poor souls that are lost in the dark,
Then, rush to the rescue with God’s mighty ark.
Do not despair for these poor, helpless souls,
Driven by tempests ’mid breakers and shoals;
Hope may be lost on the billows of woe,
Then, rush to the rescue, though stormy winds blow.
Stand by the Captain, oh, soul-saving crew,
Heed His commands, He will carry you through;
He will protect you from danger and harm,
Then, rush to the rescue amid the wild storm.

To the hall of the feast came the sinful and 
fair;
She heard in the city that Jesus was there;
Unheeding the splendor that blazed on the 
board,
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord,
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord.

Sabbath day of rest and cheer!
Day divine, to me so dear!
Come, O come to old and young,
Gath’ring all for prayer and song.

Thou Whose hand did lead Thy chosen people
Through the desert on their pilgrim way,
In Thy mercy grant us now Thy blessing,
Jesus help us all to watch and pray.

(Telephone rings and there is a conversation about "Lisa" being on the 
album)

Safe home, safe home in port!
Rent cordage, shattered deck,
Torn sails, provisions short,
And only not a wreck;
But oh! the joy upon the shore
To tell our voyage—perils o’er!

Safe in the arms of Jesus, safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o’ershaded, sweetly my soul shall rest.
Hark! ’tis the voice of angels, borne in a song to me.
Over the fields of glory, over the jasper sea.

Though beneath the drifting snow,
Summer flow’rs have been laid low,
I am safe in the tender Shepherd’s care;
Tho’ the sunbeams hide away,
On the dark and cloudy day,
I am safe in the tender Shepherd’s care.

Safe upon the billowy deep,
Loving Lord, Thy servants keep
Helpless, trusting pilgrims they,
Guard them on their watery way.

Safely through another week God has brought us on our way;
Let us now a blessing seek, on th’approaching Sabbath day;
Day of all the week the best, emblem of eternal rest,
Day of all the week the best, emblem of eternal rest.

Safely, safely, gathered in,
Far from sorrow, far from sin,
No more childish griefs or fears,
No more sadness, no more tears;
For the life so young and fair
Now hath passed from earthly care;
God Himself the soul will keep,
Giving His beloved—sleep.

Upon a wide and stormy sea,
Thou’rt sailing to eternity,
And thy great Admiral orders thee:
“Sail on! Sail on! Sail on!"

Sailor, though the darkness gathers,
Though the cold waves surge and moan,
Trust thy bark to God’s great mercy,
Falter not; sail on, sail on.

Saint of God, elect and precious,
Protomartyr Stephen, bright
With thy love of amplest measure,
Shining round thee like a light;
Who to God commendest, dying,
Them that did thee all despite.

I bind unto myself today
The strong Name of the Trinity,
By invocation of the same
The Three in One and One in Three.

The Saint who first found grace to pen
The Life which was the Life of men,
And shed abroad the Gospel’s ray,
His fame we celebrate today.

Saints in glory, we together
Know the song that ceases never;
Song of songs Thou art, O Savior;
All that endless day.

The saints should never be dismayed,
Nor sink in hopeless fear;
For when they least expect His aid,
The Savior will appear.

Saints of God! the dawn is brightening,
Token of our coming Lord:
O’er the earth the field is whitening;
Louder rings the Master’s Word;
Pray for reapers, pray for reapers
In the harvest of the Lord!

Saints of God! Lo, Jesu’s people
Age to age your glory tell;
In His Name for us ye labored,
Now in bless eternal dwell.

Saints of God! the dawn is brightening,
Token of our coming Lord:
O’er the earth the field is whitening;
Louder rings the Master’s Word;
Pray for reapers, pray for reapers
In the harvest of the Lord!

The saints of God! their conflict past,
And life’s long battle won at last,
No more they need the shield or sword,
They cast them down before their Lord:
O happy saints! forever blest,
At Jesus feet’ how safe your rest!

Salvation is for ever nigh
The souls that fear and trust the Lord
And grace descending from on high
Fresh hopes of glory shall afford.

Salvation! O, melodious sound,
To wretched, dying men!
Salvation that from God proceeds,
And leads to God again.
Rescued from hell's eternal gloom,
From fiends, and fires, and chains;
Raised to a paradise of bliss,
Where love triumphant reigns.
But may a poor, bewildered soul,
Sinful and weak as mine,
Presume to raise a trembling eye
To blessings so divine?
The luster of so bright a bliss
My feeble hear o'erbears
But unbelief almost perverts
The promise into tears.
My Saviour God, no voice but thine
These dying hopes can raise;
Speak thy salvation to my soul,
And turn my prayer to praise.

Salvation! O Mysterious Plan
Nor saints, nor angels ever can
Unfold the love of God to man,
The boundless love of Jesus;
On Calv'ry's scene I wond'ring gaze,
And raise to heav'n the voice of praise,
But O how faint are mortal lays,
To speak the love of Jesus!
The deeds that wondrous grace performs,
Can ne'er be told by mortal worms;
Assist my song, ye heav'nly forms,
To praise the name of Jesus.
Let heav'n and earth the tidings spread;
The Savior died and left the dead;
For sinful man he groaned and bled,
And from destruction freed us.
How welcome is this blissful sound
To guilty souls in fetters bound!
'Twas in this state myself I found,
And feared Jehovah's ire;
Beneath the sword of justice slain,
And sinking down to endless pain,
Or burn in quenchless fire.
Trembling I fell beneath His eye,
And raised to heav'n the ardent cry;
O' Jesus! Save I sink I die 
O hasten to deliver!
Sweet beams of mercy, love and grace,
O'erspread His charming, smiling face;
My soul received the kind embrace
That seals me His forever.

Salvation through our dying Head
Shall ever stand complete
He paid whate'er his people owed
And canceled all their debt.

Salvation unto us has come
By God's free grace and favor;
Good works cannot avert our doom,
They help and save us never.
Faith looks to Jesus Christ alone,
Who did for all the world atone;
He is our one Redeemer.

Salvation! What a Glorious Plan
How suited to our need!
The grace that raises fallen man
Is wonderful indeed!
'Twas formed the vast design,
To ransom us when lost;
And love's unfathomable mine,
Provided all the cost.
Strict Justice, with approving look,
The holy cov'nant sealed;
And Truth and Power undertook
The whole should be fulfilled.
Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Pow'r, and Love
In all their glory shone,
When Jesus left the courts above,
And died to save His own.
Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Pow'r and Love,
Are equally displayed;
Now Jesus reigns enthroned above,
Our Advocate and Head.
Now sin appears deserving death,
Most hateful and abhorred;
And yet the sinner lives by faith,
And dares approach the Lord.

Salvation! O the joyful sound!
What pleasure to our ears!
A sovereign balm for every wound,
A cordial for our fears.

There is sanctifying power,
Like a sweet, refreshing shower,
Waiting for each consecrated heart;
Power to cleanse us from all sin,
Power to keep us pure within,
Power for service which He will impart.

Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary
Pure and holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving, I'll be a living
Sanctuary for You

The sands of time are sinking, the dawn of 
Heaven breaks;
The summer morn I’ve sighed for—the fair, sweet 
morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight, but dayspring 
is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth in Immanuel’s land.

All my life I had a longing
For a drink from some clear spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.

Satisfied with Thee, Lord Jesus,
I am blest;
Peace which passeth understanding,
On Thy breast;
No more doubting, no more trembling,
Oh, what rest! Oh, what rest!

Loving Savior, hear my cry,
Hear my cry, hear my cry;
Trembling to Thy arms I fly,
Oh, save me at the cross.
I have sinned, but Thou hast died,
Thou hast died, Thou hast died;
In Thy mercy let me hide,
Oh, save me at the cross.

Save me, O Lord, from every foe;
In Thee my trust I place,
Though all the good that I can do
Can ne’er deserve Thy grace.

Save me, O God, because the floods
Come in upon my soul;
I sink in depths where none can stand;
Deep waters, o’er me roll.

Save me, O God, the swelling floods
Break in upon my soul;
I sink, and sorrows o’er my head
Like mighty waters roll.

Some day the silver cord will 
break,
And I no more as now shall sing;
But oh, the joy when I shall wake
Within the palace of the King!

Saved by the blood of the 
Crucified One!
Now ransomed from sin and a new 
work begun,
Sing praise to the Father and 
praise to the Son,
Saved by the blood of the 
Crucified One!

Adrift on the waters, so dark 
and so cold,
Afar from the beautiful city 
of gold,
A vessel is sinking, for heavy 
the gale,
The cable is broken, and 
tattered each sail.

Saved to the uttermost: I 
am the Lord’s;
Jesus my Savior salvation 
affords;
Gives me His Spirit, a 
witness within,
Whispering of pardon, and 
saving from sin.

Saved! saved! saved! my sins are all 
forgiv’n;
Christ is mine! I’m on my way to 
Heav’n;
Once a guilty sinner, lost, undone,
Now a child of God, saved thro’ His 
Son.

I’ve found a Friend, Who is 
all to me,
His love is ever true;
I love to tell how He lifted 
me
And what His grace can do 
for you.

O golden day, when light 
shall break,
And dawn’s bright 
glories shall unfold,
When He Who knows the 
path I take
Shall ope for me the 
gates of gold!
Earth’s little while 
will soon be past,
My pilgrim song will 
soon be over,
The grace that saves 
shall time outlast,
And be my theme on 
yonder shore.

Savior and 
Regenerator!
Thee alone, God we 
own,
Father and Creator.

The Savior 
calls; let 
every ear
Attend the 
heav’nly 
sound.
Ye doubting 
souls, dismiss 
your fear;
Hope smiles 
reviving 
round.

The Saviour 
comes, no 
outward 
pomp,
Bespeaks His 
presence 
nigh;
No earthly 
beauty 
shines in 
Him,
To draw the 
carnal eye.

The Savior 
died, but 
rose again
Triumphant 
from the 
grave;
And pleads 
our cause 
at God’s 
right 
hand,
Omnipotent 
to save.

Savior eternal! 
Health and life of the world unfailing,
Light everlasting!
And in verity our redemption,
grieving that the ages of men must perish
through the tempter's subtlety,
still in heaven abiding, thou camest earthward
of thine own great clemency:
Then freely and graciously
deigning to assume humanity,
to lost ones and perishing
gavest thou thy free deliverance,
filling all the world with joy.
O Christ, our souls and bodies cleanse
by thy perfect sacrifice;
that we as temples pure and bright
fit for thine abode may be.
By thy former advent justify,
by thy second grant us liberty,
that when in the might of glory
thou descendest, Judge of all,
we in raiment undefiled,
bright may shine and ever follow,
Lord, thy footsteps, where'er they lead us.

From 
Heaven 
above, 
in His 
infinite 
love,
Came 
Jesus, a 
Savior 
to be;
And He 
scorned 
the deep 
pain our 
ransom 
to gain,
O He is 
the 
Savior 
for me.

Saviour from sin, I wait to prove
That Jesus is thy healing name;
To lose, when perfected in love,
Whate'er I have, or can, or am.
I stay me on thy faithful word:
The servant shall be as his Lord.
Answer that gracious end in me
For which thy precious life was given;
Redeem from all iniquity,
Restore, and make me meet for heaven:
Unless thou purge my every stain,
Thy suffering and my faith are vain.
Didst thou not die that I might live
No longer to myself, but thee,
Might body, soul, and spirit give
To him who gave himself for me?
Come then, my Master, and my God,
Take the dear purchase of thy blood.
Thy own devoted servant claim
For thy own truth and mercy's sake;
Hallow in me thy glorious name;
Me for thine own this moment take,
And change, and throughly purify;
Thine only may I live and die.

Savior of the heathen, known
As the promised virgin’s Son;
Come Thou Wonder of the earth,
God ordained Thee such a birth.

Savior of the nations, come;
Virgin’s Son, here make Thy home!
Marvel now, O heaven and earth,
That the Lord chose such a birth.

Savior, visit thy plantation,
Grant us, LORD, a gracious rain!
All will come to desolation,
Unless thou return again:
Keep no longer at a distance,
Shine upon us from on high;
Lest, for want of thine assistance;
Every plant would droop and die.
Surely, once thy garden flourished,
Every part looked gay and green;
Then thy word our spirits nourished,
Happy seasons we have seen!
But a drought has since succeeded,
And a sad decline we see;
LORD, thy help is greatly needed,
Help can only come from thee.
Where are those we counted leaders,
Filled with zeal, and love, and truth?
Old professors, tall as cedars,
Bright examples to our youth!
Some, in whom we once delighted,
We shall meet no more below;
Some, alas! we fear are blighted,
Scarce a single leaf they show.
Younger plants-the sight how pleasant,
Covered thick with blossoms stood;
But they cause us grief at present,
Frosts have nipped them in the bud!
Dearest Savior, hasten hither,
Thou canst make them bloom again;
O, permit them not to wither,
Let not all our hopes be vain!
Let our mutual love be fervent,
Make us prevalent in prayers;
Let each one esteemed thy servant,
Shun the world's bewitching snares:
1Break the tempter's fatal power,
Turn the stony heart to flesh;
And begin, from this good hour,
To revive us, Lord, revive us.

The Savior Who loves me and suffered the loss
Of heavenly glory to die on the cross,
The Babe of the manger, though born without stain,
This Jesus is coming, is coming again!

I must have the Savior with me,
For I dare not go alone,
I must feel His presence near me,
And His arm around me thrown.

Savior! 
hasten 
Thine 
appearing;
Take 
Thy 
waiting 
people 
home!
 ’Tis 
this 
hope, 
our 
spirits 
cheering,
While 
we in 
the 
desert 
roam,
Makes 
Thy 
people
Strangers 
here 
till 
Thou 
shalt 
come.

Savior! 
I 
follow 
on, 
guided 
by 
Thee,
Seeing 
not 
yet 
the 
hand 
that 
leadeth 
me;
Hushed 
be 
my 
heart 
and 
still, 
fear 
I no 
further 
ill;
Only 
to 
meet 
Thy 
will 
my 
will 
shall 
be.

Savior, again to Thy 
dear Name we raise
With one accord our 
parting hymn of 
praise;
We stand to bless Thee 
ere our worship cease;
Then, lowly kneeling, 
wait Thy word of 
peace.

Savior, and can it be
That Thou should’st 
dwell with me?
From Thy high and 
lofty throne,
Throne of everlasting 
bliss,
Will Thy majesty stoop 
down
To so mean a house as 
this?

Savior, blessed 
Savior, listen 
while we sing;
Hearts and voices 
ringing, praises 
to our King;
All we have to 
offer, all we hope 
to be,
Body, soul, and 
spirit, all we 
yield to Thee.

Savior, breathe 
an evening 
blessing
Ere repose our 
spirits seal;
Sin and want we 
come confessing:
Thou canst save, 
and Thou canst 
heal.

Savior, 
like 
a 
shepherd 
lead 
us, 
much 
we 
need 
Thy 
tender 
care;
In 
Thy 
pleasant 
pastures 
feed 
us, 
for 
our 
use 
Thy 
folds 
prepare.
Blessed 
Jesus, 
blessed 
Jesus! 
Thou 
hast 
bought 
us, 
Thine 
we 
are.
Blessed 
Jesus, 
blessed 
Jesus! 
Thou 
hast 
bought 
us, 
Thine 
we 
are.

Savior, more than life to me,
I am clinging, clinging, close to Thee;
Let Thy precious blood applied,
Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.

Savior, Prince of Israel’s race,
See me from Thy lofty throne;
Give the sweet relenting grace,
Soften this obdurate stone!
Stone to flesh, O God, convert;
Cast a look, and break my heart!

Savior, sprinkle many nations;
Fruitful let Thy sorrows be;
By Thy pains and consolations
Draw the Gentiles unto Thee!

Savior, teach me day by day
Love’s sweet lesson to obey,
Sweeter lesson cannot be,
Loving Him Who first loved me.

Savior, Thy dying love Thou gavest me.
Nor should I aught withhold, dear Lord, from Thee.
In love my soul would bow, my heart fulfill its vow,
Some offering bring Thee now, something for Thee.

Savior, to Thee we raise our hymn of gladness;
Once more at evening’s hour we look to Heav’n above;
Far, far behind to leave earth’s toil and sadness—
So resting only on Thy great redeeming love.

Savior, when in dust to Thee
Low we bow the adoring knee,
When, repentant, to the skies
Scarce we lift our weeping eyes,
O by all the pains and woes
Suffered once for man below,
Bending from Thy throne on high,
Hear our solemn litany.

Savior, when night involves the skies,
My soul, adoring, turns to Thee;
Thee, self abased in mortal guise,
And wrapped in shades of death for me.

Savior, while my heart is tender,
I would yield that heart to Thee;
All my powers to Thee surrender,
Thine and only Thine to be.

Savior, Who didst healing give,
Still in power go before us;
Thou through death didst bid men live,
Unto fuller life restore us;
Strength from Thee the fainting found,
Deaf men heard, the blind went seeing;
At Thy touch was banished sickness,
And the leper felt new being.

Savior, Who Thy flock art feeding
With the Shepherd’s kindest care,
All the feeble gently leading,
While the lambs Thy bosom share.

Savior, Who Thy life didst give
That our souls might ransomed be,
Rest we not till all the world
Hears that love and turns to Thee.
Help us that we falter not,
Though the fields are white and wide,
And the reapers, sorely pressed,
Call for aid on every side.

Savior, Whom our hearts adore,
To bless our earth again,
Now assume Thy royal power,
And o’er the nations reign;
Christ, the world’s Desire and Hope,
Power complete to Thee is given;
Set the last great empire up,
Eternal Lord of Heaven.

Saviour! divine! we know thy name,
And in that name we trust!
Thou art the Lord our righteousness,
Thou art thine Israel's boast.
Guilty we plead before thy throne,
And low in dust we lie,
Till Jesus stretch his gracious arm,
And bring the guilty nigh.
The sins of one most righteous day
Might plunge us in despair;
Yet all the crimes of num'rous years
Does our great Surety clear.
That spotless robe, which he hath wrought,
Shall deck us all around;
Nor by the piercing eye of God,
One blemish shall be found.
Pardon, and peace, and lively hope,
To sinners now are giv'n;
Israel and Judah soon shall change
Their wilderness for heav'n.
With joy we tast that manna now,
Thy mercy scatters down;
We seal our humble vows to thee,
And wait the promisted crown.

Saw you never, in the twilight,
When the sun had left the skies,
Up in Heav’n the clear stars shining
Through the gloom, like silver eyes?
So of old the wise men, watching,
Saw a little stranger star,
And they knew the King was given,
And they followed it from afar.

In a world where sorrow
Ever will be known,
Where are found the needy,
And the sad and lone;
How much joy and comfort
You can all bestow,
If you scatter sunshine
Everywhere you go.

Scattering precious seed by the wayside,
Scattering precious seed by the hillside;
Scattering precious seed o’er the field, wide,
Scattering precious seed by the way.

Seal us, O Holy Spirit,
Grant us Thine impress, we pray;
We would be more like the Savior,
Stamped with His image today.

Sealed was the tomb, guarded by soldiers,
Brightly the moonlight shone around;
Roadway and hill gleamed in the brightness,
Flooded with light the garden’s bound.
Brighter the light seen ’neath the olives;
Forms bright as sunlight, ’mid the trees,
Soldiers were there, clad as for warfare;
Lo! they are gone, and who are these?
See yonder, hast’ning to the city,
The trembling soldiers in terror go!
Earthquake astounding, strange light surrounding,
Drive them away these things to show.

Flash out the search light, dark is the way,
Some weary wand’rer is going astray,
Many temptations lurk now at his side,
Many the perils that in his path hide.

Search me, O Lord, and try this heart of mine,
Search me, and prove if I indeed am Thine.
Test by Thy Word, that never changed can be,
My strength of hope and living faith in Thee.

Searcher of hearts, from mine erase
All thoughts that should not be,
And in its deep recesses trace
My gratitude to Thee.

The seasons are fixed by wisdom divine,
The slow-changing moon show forth God’s design;
The sun in his circuit his Maker obeys,
And running his journey hastes not nor delays.

Sweet secret prayer, comfort divine,
There, O my Lord, I know Thou art mine;
Great Master, there in secret with Thee,
Heaven comes nearer and nearer to me.

See amid the winter’s snow,
Born for us on earth below,
See, the gentle Lamb appears,
Promised from eternal years.

See Him in raiment rent,
With His blood dyed:
Women walk sorrowing,
By His side.

See how great a flame aspires,
Kindled by a spark of grace!
Jesus’ love the nations fires,
Sets the kingdoms on a blaze:
To bring fire on earth He came;
Kindled in some hearts it is:
O that all might catch the flame,
All partake the glorious bliss!

See Israel’s gentle Shepherd stand
With all engaging charms;
Hark! how He calls the tender lambs,
And folds them in His arms.

See the conqueror mounts in triumph,
see the King in royal state
riding on the clouds his chariot
to his heavenly palace gate;
hark, the choirs of angel voices
joyful alleluias sing,
and the portals high are lifted
to receive their heavenly King.
Who is this that comes in glory,
with the trump of jubilee?
Lord of battles, God of armies,
he has gained the victory;
he who on the Cross did suffer,
he who from the grave arose,
he has vanquished sin and Satan,
he by death has spoiled his foes.
He has raised our human nature
on the clouds to God's right hand;
there we sit in heavenly places,
there with him in glory stand:
Jesus reigns, adored by angels;
man with God is on the throne;
mighty Lord, in thine ascension
we by faith behold our own.
See him who is gone before us
heavenly mansions to prepare,
see him who is ever pleading
for us with prevailing prayer,
see him who with sound of trumpet
and with his angelic train,
summoning the world to judgement,
on the clouds will come again.
Glory be to God the Father;
glory be to God the Son,
dying, ris'n, ascending for us,
who the heavenly realm has won;
glory to the Holy Spirit:
to One God in Persons Three
glory both in earth and heaven,
glory, endless glory be.

See the destined day arise!
See a willing sacrifice!
Jesus, to redeem our loss,
Hangs upon the shameful cross.

See the gloomy gathering cloud
Hanging o’er a sinful land!
Sure the Lord proclaims aloud,
Times of trouble are at hand:
Happy they, who love His Name!
They shall always find Him near;
Though the earth were wrapped in flame,
They have no just cause for fear.

See the gold upon the hills,
See the opal in the sky;
Trembling dawn each valley fills,
Christ’s own morning draweth nigh.

See the ransomed millions stand,
Palms of conquest in their hand;
This before the throne their strain,
“Hell is vanquished, death is slain;
Blessing, honor, glory, might,
Are the Conqueror’s native right;
Thrones and powers before Him fall,
Lamb of God and Lord of all!"

See the shining dewdrops,
On the flowers strewed,
Proving as they sparkle,
“God is ever good."

See where our great High Priest
Before the Lord appears,
And on his loving breast
The tribes of Israel bears,
Never without his people seen,
The Head of all believing men.
With him the corner-stone
The living stones conjoin;
Christ and his church are one,
One body and one vine;
For us he uses all his powers,
And all he has, or is, is ours.
The promptings of our Head
The members all pursue,
By his good Spirit led
To act, and suffer too
Whate'er he did on earth sustain,
Till glorious all like him we reign.

See! another year is gone!
Quickly have the seasons passed!
This we enter now upon
May to many prove our last.
Mercy hitherto has spared,
But have mercies been improved?
Let us ask, am I prepared
Should I be this year removed?

See, Jesus, Thy disciples see,
The promised blessing give!
Met in Thy Name, we look to Thee,
Expecting, to receive.

See, sinners, in the Gospel glass,
The friend and Savior of mankind!
Not one of all the apostate race
But may in Him salvation find!
His thoughts, and words, and actions prove,
His life and death, that God is love!

See, the Conqueror mounts in triumph; see the King in royal state,
Riding on the clouds, His chariot, to His heavenly palace gate.
Hark! the choirs of angel voices joyful alleluias sing,
And the portals high are lifted to receive their heavenly King.

Seek the Lord who now is present, pray to One who is at hand.
Let the wicked cease from sinning, evildoers change their mind.
On the sinful God has pity; those returning God forgives.
This is what the Lord is saying to a world that disbelieves.

Seek where ye may To find a way
That leads to your salvation;
My heart is stilled, On Christ I build,
He is the one Foundation.
His Word is sure, His works endure;
He doth o'erthrow My every foe;
Through Him I more than conquer.

Jesus is waiting to welcome the weary,
Worn with the world’s fruitless striving for peace;
Tired with a night-watch that knoweth no morning,
Sick with a heartache that earth cannot ease.

Jesus, my Savior, to Bethlehem came,
Laid in a manger to sorrow and shame;
Oh, it was wonderful, blest be His Name,
Seeking for me, for me:
Seeking for me, seeking for me,
Seeking for me, seeking for me,
Oh, it was wonderful, blest be His Name,
Seeking for me, for me.

Will you go and speak to the lost ones here
To the ones who have gone astray?
Will you lead them back to the Shepherd’s fold
From their wand’rings in sin’s dark way?

Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountain astray;
“Come unto Me," His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.

Tenderly the Shepherd,
O’er the mountains cold,
Goes to bring the lost one
Back to the fold.

Self-Righteous Souls on Works Rely.
And boast their moral dignity;
But if I lisp a song of praise,
Each note shall echo, Grace, free grace.
'Twas grace that quickened me when dead;
'Twas grace my soul to Jesus led;
Grace brings a sense of pardoned sin.
And grace subdues my lusts within.
Grace reconciles to ev'ry loss,
And sweetens ev'ry painful cross
Defends my soul when danger's near;
By grace alone I persevere.
When from this world my soul removes
To mansions of delight and love,
I'll cast my crown before His throne,
And shout, Free grace, free grace alone.

We are waiting and watching, dear Savior,
For an old time revival we pray;
Thou Who hast all the floods in Thy keeping,
Send a wave of salvation today.

Send down Thy truth, O God;
Too long the shadows frown;
Too long the darkened way we’ve trod:
Thy truth, O Lord, send down.

Send forth the gospel! Let it run
Southward and northward, east and west:
Tell all the earth Christ died and lives,
He offers pardon, life, and rest.
Send forth Your gospel, mighty Lord!
Out of the chaos bring to birth
Your own creation's promised hope;
The better days of heaven on earth.
Send forth Your gospel, gracious Lord!
Yours was the blood for sinners shed;
Your voice still pleads in human hearts;
To You may all Your sheep be led.
Send forth Your gospel, holy Lord!
Kindle in us love's sacred flame;
Love giving all and grudging naught
For Jesus' sake, in Jesus' name.
Send forth Your gospel! Tell in out!
Go, brothers, at the Master's call;
Prepare His way, who comes to reign
The King of kings and Lord of all.

Send forth, O God, Thy light and truth,
And let them lead me still,
Undaunted, in the paths of right,
Up to Thy holy hill.
Then to Thy altar will I spring,
And in my God rejoice;
And praise shall tune the trembling string,
And gratitude my voice.

Send, O Lord, Thy Holy Spirit
On Thy servant now, we pray;
Let him prove a faithful shepherd
To Thy little lambs alway.
Thy pure teaching to proclaim,
To extol Thy holy name,
And to feed Thy lambs, dear Savior,
Make his aim and sole endeavor.

Send out a light as you go your way,
A beacon of hope when shadows are gray;
Send out a light that for Jesus will shine,
Proving to others God’s mercy divine.

Send out the sunlight, the sunlight of cheer
Shine on earth’s sadness till it disappear—
Souls are in waiting this message to hear,
Send out the sunlight of love.

Thou Christ of burning, cleansing flame,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
Thy blood bought gift today we claim,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
Look down and see this waiting host,
Give us the promised Holy Ghost;
We want another Pentecost,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

Send the Light, oh, send it quickly
Far across the heaving main;
Speed the news of full salvation,
Thro’ a dear Redeemer’s Name.

There’s a call comes ringing over the restless wave,
“Send the light! Send the light!"
There are souls to rescue there are souls to save,
Send the light! Send the light!

Lord, Thou hast gone two thousand years,
Yet they have never heard
Tidings of Thy redeeming love,
Or seen Thy holy Word.
Sleeping and still Thy Church has lain,
Heedless of the high command—
“Go forth to ev’ry tribe and tongue,
To ev’ry distant land."

Send Thou, O Lord, to every place
Swift messengers before Thy face,
The heralds of Thy wondrous grace,
Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

We come before Thy throne today,
Thy promised presence claim;
O come and enter now our hearts,
And set our souls aflame.

Servant of all, to toil for man
Thou didst not, Lord, refuse;
Thy majesty did not disdain
To be employed for us.

Servants of God, awake
to hail this sacred day,
and in glad songs of praise
your grateful homage pay;
come, bless the day that God hath blessed,
the type of heaven's eternal rest.
Upon this happy morn
the Lord of life arose;
he burst the bonds of death,
and vanquished all our foes;
and now he pleads our cause above,
and reaps the fruit of all his love.
All hail, triumphant Lord!
Heaven with hosanna rings,
and earth in humbler strains
thy praise responsive sings;
worthy the Lamb, that once was slain,
through endless years to live and reign!

Servant of God, remember
The stream thy soul bedewing,
The grace that came upon thee
Anointing and renewing.

Servant of God, well done!
Thy glorious warfare’s past;
The battle’s fought, the race is won,
And thou art crowned at last.

Lead to the shadow of the Rock of Refuge
My weary feet;
Give me the water from the life-stream flowing
Clear, pure and sweet.

When we cross the valley there need be no shadows,
When life’s day is ended and its sorrows o’er;
When the summons comes to meet the blessed Savior,
When we rise to dwell with Him forevermore.

The shadows of the evening hours fall from the darkening sky;
Upon the fragrance of the flowers the dews of evening lie;
Before Thy throne, O Lord of Heav’n, we kneel at close of day;
Look on Thy children from on high, and hear us while we pray.

Shall atheists dare insult the cross
Of our Redeemer, God?
Shall infidels reproach His laws,
Or trample on His blood?

Shall hymns of grateful love
Through Heav’n’s high arches ring,
And all the hosts above their songs of triumph sing;
And shall we not take up the strain,
And send the echo back again?

Jesus is pleading with my poor soul, shall I be saved tonight?
If I believe, He will make me whole, shall I be saved tonight?
Tenderly, sadly, I hear Him say, “How can you grieve me from day to day?"
Shall I go on in the old, old way, or shall I be saved tonight?

Shall I, for fear of feeble man,
The Spirit’s course in me restrain?
Or, undismayed, in deed and word
Be a true witness for my Lord?

Shall man, O God of light and life,
Forever molder in the grave?
Canst Thou forget Thy glorious work,
Thy promise, and Thy power to save?

Shall we gather at the river,
Where bright angel feet have trod,
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God?

Shall we meet beyond the river,
Where the surges cease to roll?
Where in all the bright forever,
Sorrow ne’er shall press the soul?

Shall we not love thee, Mother dear,
Whom Jesus loves so well?
And to his glory year by year
Thy joy and honour tell?
Bound with the curse of sin and shame
We helpless sinners lay,
Until in tender love he came
To bear the curse away.
And thee he chose from whom to take
True flesh his flesh to be;
In it to suffer for our sake,
By it to make us free.
Thy Babe he lay upon thy breast,
To thee he cried for food;
Thy gentle nursing sooth'd to rest
The incarnate Son of God.
O wondrous depth of grace divine
That he should bend so low!
And, Mary, O what joy 'twas thine
In his dear love to know!
Joy to be Mother of the Lord,
And thine the truer bliss,
In every thought and deed and word
To be for ever his.
And as he loves thee, Mother dear,
We too will love thee well;
And to his glory year by year
Thy joy and honour tell.
Jesu, the Virgin's holy Son,
We praise thee and adore,
Who art with God the Father One
And Spirit evermore.

Some one will enter the pearly gates—
By and by, by and by,
Taste of the glories that there await,
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?
Someone will travel the streets of gold,
Beautiful visions will there behold,
Feast on the pleasures so long foretold:
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?

She loved her Savior, and to Him
Her costliest present brought;
To crown His head, or grace His Name,
No gift too rare she thought.

She only touched the hem of His garment
As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him,
And straightway she was whole.

The Lord’s our Rock, in Him we hide,
A Shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill betide,
A Shelter in the time of storm.

There is a Rock in a weary land,
Its shadow falls on the burning sand,
Inviting pilgrims as they pass,
To seek a shade in the wilderness.
Then why will ye die?
O why will ye die?
When the sheltering Rock is so near by,
O why will ye die?

A shepherd band their flocks are keeping,
And gentle lambs are sweetly sleeping;
When suddenly they all behold
An angel in bright robes, with harp of gold.

Shepherd divine, our wants relieve
In this our evil day,
To all Thy tempted followers give
The power to watch and pray.

The Shepherd now was smitten;
The wolf was ravening near;
The scattered flock he threatened,
But knew not Whose they were.

The Shepherd of Love is seeking the lost
In paths that are rough and steep;
He’s calling the lambs that have gone astray,
He’s calling, calling His sheep.

Shepherd of souls, refresh and bless
Thy chosen pilgrim flock
With manna in the wilderness,
With water from the rock.

Shepherd of tender youth, guiding in love and truth
Through devious ways; Christ our triumphant King,
We come Thy Name to sing and here our children bring
To join Thy praise.

Shepherd of tender youth, guiding in love and truth
Through devious ways; Christ our triumphant King,
We come Thy Name to sing and here our children bring
To join Thy praise.

Shepherd, show me how to go
O’er the hillside steep,
How to gather, how to sow,
How to feed Thy sheep.
I will listen for Thy voice,
Lest my footsteps stray;
I will follow and rejoice
All the rugged way.

When the sheep have all been gathered,
To the Shepherd’s fold on high,
And are resting, sweetly resting
 ’Neath a calm, unchanging sky;
When we look with cloudless vision
Stretching far and far away,
O’er that land beyond the sunset,
Where the morning breezes play.

Shepherds, in the field abiding,
Tell us, when the seraph bright
Greeted you with wondrous tiding,
What ye saw and heard that night:
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
We beheld (it is no fable)
God incarnate, King of bliss,
Swathed and cradled in a stable,
And the angel-strain was this:
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Quiristers on high were singing
Jesus and his Virgin-birth;
Heavenly bells the while a-ringing
 'Peace, goodwill to men on earth:'
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Thanks, good herdmen; true your story;
Have with you to Bethlehem:
Angels hymn the King of Glory;
Carol we with you and them:
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Shepherds! Shake off your drowsy sleep,
Rise and leave your silly sheep;
Angels from Heav’n around loud singing,
Tidings of great joy are bringing,

“Shepherds, rejoice! lift up your eyes,
And send your fears away;
News from the regions of the skies,
Salvation’s born today.

Shepherds, what joyful tidings
Have made you sing and play?
Long have we been awaiting
The Lamb that came today.
Cherubim, seraphim sang to us merrily,
 “Fear not, but hurry ye over to Bethlehem."

Be a faithful witness for the Lord,
Shine for Jesus where you are;
You cannot an idle hour afford,
Just shine for Jesus where you are.

When clouds hang low, and dark thy path,
Then trust and know they’ll lift at last;
Whate’er the load, then look to God,
Though long the road, e’er onward plod.

See the brightly shining star,
As its radiance beams afar,
Guide the feet of weary pilgrims
To the place where Jesus lay.
Like a beacon from its height,
Burning brightly in the night,
As the wise men followed onward,
Safely guided all the way.

O wondrous star of Bethlehem!
That in the heavens bright
Shone forth to guide the pilgrims’ feet,
Unto the Prince of Light,
Shine on thro’ endless ages,
While ringing thro’ the sky;
His loyal ones still hear the song:
 “Glory to God on high!"

Shine Thou upon us, Lord, true Light of men, 
today,
And through the written Word Thy very self 
display,
That so from hearts which burn with gazing on Thy 
face
Thy little ones may learn the wonders of Thy 
grace.

Shining out of darkness, came the Christmas time,
With light sublime, with light sublime;
Glory-light from Heaven thrilled the sleeping earth,
The holy night of Jesus’ birth.
Memories of that glory seem to linger still—
To linger still, o’er vale and hill;
Stars of Christmas ever seem more bright, more clear,
Than any star throughout the year.

The ships glide in at the harbor’s mouth,
And the ships sail out to sea;
And the wind that sweeps from the sunny south
Is sweet as sweet can be.
There’s a world of toil and a world of pain,
And a world of trouble and care,
But O in a world where our Father reigns,
There is gladness everywhere!

The love of God, Whose sacred bond,
Nor life nor death can sever,
Thro’ grace divine has made us one,
In Christ the Lord forever.

There’s a shout in the camp, for the

A shout of mighty triumph
Through nature’s realm is heard,
A shout which calls creation
To hail th’Incarnate Word.
Away with clouds and darkness!
All hail, thrice blessed morn;
Sing out with joy, ye mortals,
For Jesus Christ is born!

Shout the tidings of salvation
To the aged and the young,
Till the precious invitation
Waken ev’ry heart and tongue.

Shout, for the blessed Jesus reigns;
Through distant lands His triumphs spread;
And sinners, freed from endless pains,
Own Him their Savior and their Head.

Fearless and faithful, trusting and 
true,
Loyal to Jesus, in all I do;
Seeking His glory, loving His laws,
Ready and willing to honor His 
cause.

Show pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive,
Let a repenting rebel live:
Are not Thy mercies large and 
free?
May not a sinner trust in Thee?

Here in Thy Name we are 
gathered,
Come and revive us, O Lord;
 “There shall be showers of 
blessing,"
Thou hast declared in Thy Word.

The sign of the cross I 
triumphantly bear,
Though none of my kindred that 
emblem may wear.
I joyfully follow the 
champions of right,
Who march on to glory, who 
march on to glory,
Who march on to glory with 
weapons of might.

Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and 
Child.
Holy Infant, so tender and 
mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silently the shades of 
evening
Gather round my lowly 
door;
Silently they bring before 
me
Faces I shall see no more.

On the brow of night 
there shines a silver 
star,
On the brow of night 
there shines a silver 
star,
And the wise men gaze on 
its heav’nly rays,
Till they find the King, 
Whose throne they sought 
afar,
In the Babe of 
Bethlehem.

In the twilight of the 
morning,
When the shadows steal 
away,
And we wake from balmy 
slumber
To behold another day,
Let us go alone in 
secret,
And unburden all our 
care
At the feet of our 
Redeemer,
In the simple, earnest 
prayer.

Sin has a thousand treacherous arts
To practice on the mind;
With flattering looks she tempts our hearts,
But leaves a sting behind.

Sin, like a venomous disease,
Infects our vital blood;
The only balm is sovereign grace,
And the physician, God.

Sin, when viewed by 
scripture light,
Is a horrid, hateful 
sight;
But when seen in 
Satan’s glass,
Then it wears a 
pleasing face.

Life wears a different face to me,
Since I found my Savior;
Rich mercy at the cross I see,
My dying, living Savior.

I have a song I 
love to sing,
Since I have been 
redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, 
Savior King,
Since I have been 
redeemed.

What a wonderful 
change in my 
life has been 
wrought
Since Jesus came 
into my heart!
I have light in 
my soul for 
which long I had 
sought,
Since Jesus came 
into my heart!

Since Jesus 
freely did 
appear
To grace a 
marriage feast
O Lord, we ask 
Thy presence 
here,
To make a 
wedding Guest.

Since Jesus 
is my 
Friend,
And I to Him 
belong,
It matters 
not what 
foes intend,
However 
fierce and 
strong.

Since through God’s mercy this ministry’s ours,
Bringing men righteousness through God’s great power,
We don’t lose heart but renounce shameful ways;
We don’t deceive but the truth plainly say.
To unbelievers our message is veiled;
They are made blind by the god of this world.
But God who said, “Let the dark turn to light,"
Shined in our hearts with His glory so bright.

Since we have confidence to come to God,
Since Jesus made a way by His own blood,
Since He the veil did tear, 
A living way made clear,
Our great High Priest is e’er,
Let us draw near.

Since with 
my God 
with 
perfect 
heart
I walk and 
make His 
Word my 
guide,
And from 
iniquity 
depart,
The Lord 
His 
blessing 
will 
provide.

Since 
without 
Thee we 
do no 
good,
And with 
Thee do 
no ill,
Abide 
with us 
in weal 
and woe,
In 
action 
and in 
will.

Sinful, sighing to be blessed;
bound, and longing to be free;
weary, waiting for my rest:
God be merciful to me.
Goodness I have none to plead,
sinfulness in all I see,
I can only bring my need:
God be merciful to me.
Broken heart and downcast eyes
dare not lift themselves to thee;
yet thou canst interpret sighs:
God be merciful to me.
From this sinful heart of mine
to thy bosom I would flee:
I am not mine own, but thine:
God be merciful to me.
There is One beside the throne,
and my only hope and plea
are in him and him alone:
God be merciful to me.
He my cause will undertake,
my interpreter will be;
he's my all; and for his sake
God be merciful to me.

Sinful, 
sighing 
to be 
blest,
Bound, 
and 
longing 
to be 
free;
Weary, 
waiting 
for my 
rest:
God, 
be 
merciful 
to me.

Sing 
a 
new 
song 
to 
Jehovah, 
for 
the 
wonders 
He 
has 
wrought,
His 
right 
hand 
and 
arm 
most 
holy 
triumph 
to 
His 
cause 
have 
brought.
In 
His 
love 
and 
tender 
mercy 
He 
has 
made 
salvation 
known,
In 
the 
sight 
of 
every 
nation 
He 
His 
righteousness 
has 
shown.

Sing, All Ye Ransomed of the Lord
Your great Deliv'rer sing!
Ye pilgrims, now for Zion bound,
Be joyful in your King.
His hand divine shall lead you on,
Through all the blissful road,
Till to the sacred mount you rise,
And see your gracious God.
Bright garlands of immortal joy
Shall bloom on ev'ry head;
While sorrow, sighing, and distress,
Like shadows, all are fled.
March on in your Redeemer's strength
Pursue His footsteps still;
With joyful hope still fix your eye
On Zion's heav'nly hill.

Sing 
Alleluia 
forth 
in 
duteous 
praise,
Ye 
citizens 
of 
Heav’n; 
O 
sweetly 
raise
An 
endless 
Alleluia.

Sing aloud Jehovah’s praises
Tell abroad the awful Name;
Heav’n the ceaseless anthem raises,
Let the earth her God proclaim—
God, the hope of every nation,
God, the source of consolation,
Holy, blessed Trinity!

Oh! I love the Gospel song,
How it sweetly rolls along,
Let the earth the strains prolong,
Sing aloud with gladness:
Blessed news to sinners bringing,
While the angel choirs are singing,
And the bells of Heav’n are ringing,
Sing aloud with gladness.

Sing with a tuneful spirit,
Sing with a cheerful lay,
Praise to thy great Creator,
While on the pilgrim way.
Sing when the birds are waking,
Sing with the morning light;
Sing in the noontide’s golden beam,
Sing in the hush of night.

Sing away the shadows,
Flitting o’er the sky;
Sing of starry comforts,
In the by and by!
Sing of love unfailing,
Mercies ever new;
Pardon, peace and blessing,
Guidance kind and true.

Sing hallelujah, praise the Lord!
Sing with a cheerful voice;
Exalt our God with one accord,
And in His Name rejoice.
Ne’er cease to sing, thou ransomed host,
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Until in realms of endless light
Your praises shall unite.

Sing lullaby!
lullaby baby, now reclining:
sing lullaby!
Hush, do not wake the infant king;
angels are watching, stars are shining
over the place where he is lying:
sing lullaby.
Sing lullaby!
lullaby baby, sweetly sleeping:
sing lullaby!
Hush, do not wake the infant king;
soon will come sorrow with the morning,
soon will come bitter grief and weeping:
sing lullaby!
Sing lullaby!
lullaby baby, gently dozing:
sing lullaby!
Hush, do not wake the infant king;
soon comes the cross, the nails, the piercing,
then in the grave at last reposing:
sing lullaby!
Sing lullaby!
lullaby! Is the baby waking?
sing lullaby!
Hush, do not stir the infant king,
dreaming of Easter, joyful morning,
conquering death, its bondage breaking:
sing lullaby!

Sing, my soul, his wondrous love,
who from yon bright throne above,
ever watchful o'er our race,
still to us extends his grace.
Heaven and earth by him were made;
all is by his scepter swayed;
what are we that he should show
so much love to us below?
God, the merciful and good,
bought us with the Savior's blood,
and, to make our safety sure,
guides us by his Spirit pure.
Sing, my soul, adore his Name!
Let his glory be thy theme:
praise him till he calls thee home;
truth his love for all to come.

Sing of Andrew, John's disciple,
led by faith through ways untrod,
till the Baptist cried at Jordan,
"There behold the Lamb of God!"
Stirred by hearing this new teacher,
Andrew, freed from doubt and fear,
ran to tell his brother Simon,
"God's Anointed One is here!"
Sing of Andrew, called by Jesus
from the shores of Galilee,
leaving boats and nets and kindred,
trusting in that "Follow me."
When a lad's small meal fed thousands,
when inquiring Greeks found care,
when the Spirit came in blessing,
Andrew faithfully was there.
Sing of Andrew, bold apostle, 
sent to make the Gospel known,
faithful to his Lord's example,
called to make a cross his own.
So may we who prize his memory
honor Christ in our own day,
bearing witness to our neighbors,
living what we sing and pray.

Sing of God made manifest
in a child robust and blest,
to whose home in Bethlehem
where a star had guided them,
magi came and gifts unbound,
signs mysterious and profound:
myrrh and frankincense and gold
grave and God and King foretold.
Sing of God made manifest
when at Jordan John confessed,
"I should be baptized by you,
but your bidding I will do."
Then from heaven a double sign--
dove-like Spirit, voice divine--
hailed the true Anointed One:
"This is my beloved Son."
Sing of God made manifest
when Christ came as wedding guest
and at Cana gave a sign,
turning water into wine;
further still was love revealed
as he taught, forgave, and healed,
bringing light and life to all
who would listen to God's call.
Sing of God made manifest
on the cloud-capped mountain's crest,
where both voice and vision waned
until Christ alone remained:
glimpse of glory, pledge of grace,
given as Jesus set his face
towards the waiting cross and grave,
sign of hope that God would save.

Oh, sing once more of Jesus,
Tune every heart and voice,
Proclaim His tender mercy,
And in His love rejoice.

Sing out your gladsome carols,
Set all the echoes ringing!
Welcome the joyous season,
Welcome it now with singing.
Light in the midst of darkness,
Coming from realms of day;
Hail to the King of Glory,
 ’Neath the star He lay!

Sing praise to God Who reigns above, the God of all creation,
The God of power, the God of love, the God of our salvation.
With healing balm my soul is filled and every faithless murmur stilled:
To God all praise and glory.

Sing praise to the Lord! Praise Him in the height;
Rejoice in His Word, you angels of light.
You heavens, adore Him by Whom you were made,
And worship before Him in brightness arrayed.

Wake the joyful, joyful lay,
Sing praise to Jesus;
With the merry birds today,
Sing praise to Jesus.
Gather now a grateful throng,
Let our school be full of song,
Heart and voice the strain prolong,
Sing praise to Jesus.

Sing to me of Heaven, sing that song of peace,
From the toils that bind me it will bring release;
Burdens will be lifted that are pressing so,
Showers of great blessing o’er my heart will flow.

Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!
All praise to Him belongs:
Who kindly lengthens out our days
Demands our choicest songs.

Sing to the Lord a joyful song,
Lift up your hearts, your voices raise;
To us his gracious gifts belong,
To him our songs of love and praise;
For life and love, for rest and food,
For daily help and nightly care,
Sing to the Lord, for he is good,
And praise his name, for it is fair;
For strength to those who on him wait
His truth to prove, his will to do,
Praise ye our God, for he is great,
Trust in his name, for it is true.
For joys untold, that from above
Cheer those who love his sweet employ,
Sing to our God, for he is love,
Exalt his name, for it is joy.
For he is Lord of heaven and earth,
Whom angels serve and saints adore,
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
To whom be praise for evermore.

Sing to the Lord Jehovah’s Name,
And in His strength rejoice;
When His salvation is our theme,
Exalted be our voice.

Sing to the Lord of harvest,
Sing songs of love and praise;
With joyful hearts and voices
Your alleluias raise.
By Him the rolling seasons
In fruitful order move;
Sing to the Lord of harvest,
A joyous song of love.

Sing to the Lord the children’s hymn,
His gentle love declare,
Who bends amid the seraphim
To hear the children’s prayer.

Sing to the Lord, ye heav’nly hosts,
And thou, O earth, adore;
Let death and hell through all their coasts
Stand trembling at His power.

Sing to the Lord, sing His praise, all ye peoples,
New be your song as new honors ye pay;
Sing of His majesty, bless Him forever,
Show His salvation from day to day.

Sing to the Lord, the Rock of our salvation!
Sing to the Lord a song of joy and praise!
Kneel in His presence, lowly in thanksgiving!
The lofty psalm upraise!

Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands!
Ye tribes of every tongue!
His new discovered grace demands
A new and nobler song.

Sing unto God, our Hope and our Deliv’rer;
He is the Lord, the mighty theme prolong;
Pour out your hearts in music’s sweetest numbers,
Pour out your hearts in melody and song.
Seek ye the gates, the lovely gates of Zion,
Now let His courts with holy rapture ring;
Wake, wake again, the silent harp of Judah;
Break forth ye hills, and let the desert sing.
Sing unto God, our Hope and our Deliv’rer;
He is the Lord, the mighty theme prolong;
Pour out your hearts in music’s sweetest numbers,
Pour out your hearts in melody and song.

Sister, Thou Wast Mild and Lovely
Gentle as the summer breeze,
Pleasant as the air of ev'ning
As it floats among the trees.
Peaceful be thy silent slumber,
Peaceful in the grave so low;
Thou no more wilt join our number,
Thou no more our songs shall know.
Dearest sister, thou hast left us,
Here thy loss we deeply feel,
But 't is God that hath bereft us,
He can all our sorrows heal.
Yet again we hope to meet thee,
When the day of life is fled;
Then in heav'n with joy to greet thee,
Where no farewell tears are shed.

Sing we all the joys and sorrows
which in Mary's heart were found;
to her fame our voices raising
let consenting praise abound:
so do bird of night and morning
make their mingled songs resound.
Through the guest-throng at the banquet
undismayed she sought her Lord;
cleansing tears and salving ointments
lowly on his feet she poured,
wiped them with her hair, obtaining
by her love the great reward.
Deigns the Cleanser to be cleansed;
stoops the Source to find the flow;
drains the Flower in outpoured fragrance
perfume which its heart let go:
heavens which have rained their bounty
drink the dew from earth below!
There in box of alabaster,
bearing nard of fragrance pure,
she with gift of outpoured sweetness
bids the mystic sign endure:
seeking from anointment healing,
lo, the sick anoints the Cure!
Dearly then for that dear offering
did our Lord in love repay:
since so perfect her devotion,
all her sins he put away:
made her be his own forerunner
on his Resurrection day.
Now be glory, laud and honor
unto him the Paschal Host,
who, in war with Death a Lion,
as a Lamb gave up the ghost,
and the third day rose a Victor
crowned with spoils that Death had lost.

Sing we merry Christmas,
Christmas blithe and free!
Time of holy gladness,
Mirth and minstrelsy.
Hark! the merry church bells
Ringing joyously,
Hailing with sweet music
Christ’s nativity.

Sing we the glory of our God,
Who on the second day
Spread out the firmament above,
His wonders to display.

Sing we the King Who is coming to reign,
Glory to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain.
Life and salvation His empire shall bring,
Joy to the nations when Jesus is King.

Sing we the praises of the great forerunner,
tell forth the mighty wonders of his story:
so may his Master cleanse our lips and make them
fit to extol him.
Lo, God's high herald, swift from heaven descending,
gives to thy father tidings of thy coming,
telling thy name and all the tale of marvels
that shall befall thee.
Oft had the prophets in the time before thee
spoken in vision of the Daystar's coming;
but when he came, 'twas thou that didst proclaim him
Savior of all men.

Sing we the song of those who stand
Around th’eternal throne,
Of every kindred, clime, and land,
A multitude unknown.

Sing we triumphant hymns of praise,
New hymns to Heaven exulting raise:
Christ, by a road before untrod,
Ascendeth to the throne of God.

Sing with all the saints in glory, sing the resurrection song!
 [

Sing, ye faithful, sing with gladness,
wake your noblest, sweetest strain,
with the praises of your Savior
let his house resound again;
him let all your music honor,
and your songs exalt his reign.
Sing how he come forth from heaven,
bowed himself to Bethlehem's cave,
stooped to wear the servant's vesture,
bore the pain, the cross, the grave,
passed within the gates of darkness,
thence his banished ones to save.
So, he tasted death for all men,
he, of all mankind the head,
sinless one, among the sinful,
Prince of life, among the dead; 
thus he wrought the full redemption,
and the captor captive led.
Now on high, yet ever with us,
from his Father's throne the Son
rules and guides the world he ransomed,
till the appointed work be done,
till he see, renewed and perfect,
all things gathered into one.
Alleluia to the Father,
alleluia to the Son,
alleluia to the Spirit,
ever Three and ever One,
one in love and one in glory,
while unending ages run.

Sing ye the songs of praise; Jesus is come!
High your glad voices raise; Jesus is come!
Cast worldly cares away, worship and homage pay;
Welcome the blessed day, Jesus is come!

Sing, my soul, to God Who made thee,
Raise to Heaven thy grateful voice;
All His creatures, singing, bid thee
In His goodness now rejoice.
Pure and holy love unbounded
Fills His tender heart and kind;
All who truly serve Him find
Rest, by God’s strong arm surrounded.

Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle,
Sing the ending of the fray;
Now above the cross, the trophy,
Sound the loud triumphant lay:
Tell how Christ the world’s Redeemer,
As a victim won the day.

Sing, my tongue, the Savior’s glory,
Of His flesh the mystery sing,
Of the blood, all price exceeding,
Shed by our immortal King,
Destined, for the world’s redemption,
From a noble womb to spring.

Sing, O sing, this blessed morn,
Unto us a Child is born,
Unto us a Son is given,
God Himself comes down from Heav’n.

Sing, ye ransomed nations, sing
Praises to our new-born King;
Son of Man our Maker is,
Lord of Hosts and Prince of Peace.

I feel like singing all the time,
My tears are wiped away;
For Jesus is a friend of mine,
I'll serve Him every day.

Singing for Jesus, our Savior and King,
Singing for Jesus, the Lord whom we love;
All adoration we joyously bring,
Longing to praise as they praise Him above.

The trusting heart to Jesus clings,
Nor any ill forebodes,
But at the cross of Calv’ry, sings,
Praise God for lifted loads!

Singing, singing, light and free,
As the merry birds are we;
For a precious Friend is near,
Bending now our song to hear.

O I am singing of Jesus,
Happy as mortal can be;
How can I help but adore Him,
He is so gracious to me:
Holding me up when I falter,
Giving me light from His throne,
Cheering me on with His counsel,
Keeping my hand in His own?

Singing songs of expectation,
onward goes the pilgrim band,
through the night of doubt and sorrow,
marching to the promised land.
Clear before us through the darkness
gleams and burns the guiding light:
brother clasps the hand of brother,
stepping fearless through the night.
One the light of God's own presence,
o'er his ransomed people shed,
chasing far the gloom and terror,
brightening all the path we tread:
one the object of our journey,
one the faith which never tires,
one the earnest looking forward,
one the hope our God inspires.
One the strain the lips of thousands
lift as from the heart of one;
one the conflict, one the peril,
one the march in God begun:
one the gladness of rejoicing
on the far eternal shore,
where the one almighty Father
reigns in love for evermore.

There’s joy in the sunshine and love in the air,
When Jesus we meet by the way;
His smile makes each blossom more lovely and fair,
And so we are singing today.

To the hall of the feast came the sinful and 
fair;
She heard in the city that Jesus was there;
Unheeding the splendor that blazed on the 
board,
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord,
She silently knelt at the feet of the Lord.

Sinner, art thou still secure?
Wilt thou still refuse to pray?
Can thy heart or hands endure
In the Lord’s avenging day?

Oh, sinner, turn to Jesus now,
No longer make delay;
Since Jesus died on Calvary,
And opened up the way.

Sinners, believe the Gospel word,
Jesus is come your souls to save
Jesus is come, your common Lord;
Pardon ye all through Him may have,
May now be saved, whoever will;
This Man receiveth sinners still.

Sinners, dismiss your fear,
The joyful tidings hear!
This the word that Jesus said,
O believe, and feel it true;
Christ is risen from the dead,
Lives the Lord Who died for you!

Sinners, obey the Gospel word!
Haste to the supper of our Lord!
Be wise to know your gracious day;
All things are ready, come away!

Sinners, rejoice: your peace is made;
Your Savior on the cross hath bled:
Your God, in Jesus reconciled,
On all His works again hath smiled;
Hath grace through Him and blessing 
giv’n,
To all in earth and all in Heav’n.

Sinners, the voice of God regard;
 ’Tis mercy speaks today;
He calls you by His sacred Word
From sin’s destructive way.

Sinners, turn: why will you die?
God, your Maker, asks you why.
God, Who did your being give,
Gave Himself, that you might live;
He the fatal cause demands,
Asks the work of His own hands.
Why, you thankless creatures, why,
Will you cross His love, and die?

Sion’s daughter, weep no more,
Though thy troubled heart be 
sore;
He of Whom the psalmist sung,
He Who woke the prophet’s 
tongue,
Christ, the Mediator blest,
Brings thee everlasting rest.

Sister, Thou Wast Mild and Lovely
Gentle as the summer breeze,
Pleasant as the air of ev'ning
As it floats among the trees.
Peaceful be thy silent slumber,
Peaceful in the grave so low;
Thou no more wilt join our number,
Thou no more our songs shall know.
Dearest sister, thou hast left us,
Here thy loss we deeply feel,
But 't is God that hath bereft us,
He can all our sorrows heal.
Yet again we hope to meet thee,
When the day of life is fled;
Then in heav'n with joy to greet thee,
Where no farewell tears are shed.

Six days of labor now are 
past;
Thou restest, Holy God;
And of Thy finished work has 
said,
That all is very good.

Sleep! Holy Babe! upon 
Thy mother’s breast;
Great Lord of earth and 
sea and sky,
How sweet it is to see 
Thee lie
In such a place of rest,
In such a place of rest.

Sleep, baby, sleep!
Thy father guards the 
sheep,
Thy mother shakes the 
dreamland tree,
And from it fall sweet 
dreams for thee;
Sleep, baby, sleep!
Sleep, baby, sleep!

Sleep, little Baby, 
sleep, O sleep,
Mother dear sang.
Tenderly rest, Child, 
sleep in peace,
Her soft voice rang.
Sleep, heav’nly Child, 
tenderly sleep,
Lord God art Thou.
Heaven and earth in 
praises join,
Praise to Thee now.

Sleep, my little 
Jesus,
On Thy bed of hay,
While the shepherds 
homeward
Journey on their 
way.
Mother is Thy 
shepherd
And will her vigil 
keep:
Did the voices wake 
Thee?
O sleep, my Jesus, 
sleep!

"Sleepers, wake!" 
the watch cry 
pealeth,
While slumber deep 
each eyelid sealeth:
Awake, Jerusalem, 
awake!
Midnight’s solemn 
hour is tolling,
And seraph-notes are 
onward rolling;
They call on us our 
part to take.
Come forth, ye 
virgins wise:
The Bridegroom 
comes, arise!
Alleluia! Each lamp 
be bright with ready 
light
To grace the 
marriage feast 
tonight.

A Stranger stands 
outside the door,
And longs thy guest 
to be;
He knows thy name, 
for o’er and o’er
He softly calls to 
thee!
His hands are 
pierced, His brow is 
torn,
His face is sad, but 
sweet—
It is the Lord of 
Paradise!
Arise, thy Savior 
greet.

Slowly fall the snowflakes, clothing earth in white,
Sweetly bells are chiming, on this Christmas night;
Dark the earth aforetime, white on Christmas morn;
Christ the curse reversing—Mary’s Son is born.

A Stranger stands 
outside the door,
And longs thy guest 
to be;
He knows thy name, 
for o’er and o’er
He softly calls to 
thee!
His hands are 
pierced, His brow is 
torn,
His face is sad, but 
sweet—
It is the Lord of 
Paradise!
Arise, thy Savior 
greet.

The snow lay on 
the ground,
The stars shone 
bright,
When Christ our 
Lord was born
On Christmas 
night.
Venite adoremus 
Dominum;
Venite adoremus 
Dominum.

So let our lips 
and lives 
express
The holy Gospel 
we profess;
So let our works 
and virtues 
shine,
To prove the 
doctrine all 
divine.

So near to the 
kingdom! yet 
what dost thou 
lack?
So near to the 
kingdom! what 
keepeth thee 
back?
Renounce every 
idol, tho’ 
dear it may 
be,
And come to 
the Savior now 
pleading with 
thee.

So send I you to labour unrewarded
To serve unpaid, unloved, unsought, unknown
To bear rebuke, ot suffer scorn and scoffing
So send I you to toil for Me alone
So send I you to bind the bruised and broken
Over wandering souls to work, to weep, to wake
To bear the burdens of a world a-weary
So send I you to suffer for My sake
So send I you to loneliness and longing
With hart a-hungering for tthe loved and known
Forsaking kin and kindred, friend and dear one
So send I you to know My love alone
So send I you to leave your life's ambition
To die to dear desire, self-will resign
To labour long, and love where men revile you
So send I you to lsoe you life in Mine
So send I you to hearts made hard by hatred
To eyes made blind because they will not see
To spend, though it be blood to spend and spare not
So send I you to taste of Calvary
"As the Father hath sent me, so send I you"

So send I you-by grace made strong to triumph
O'er hosts of hell, o'er darkness, death, and sin,
My name to bear, and in that name to conquer-
So send I you, my victory to win.
So send I you-to take to souls in bondage
The word or truth that sets the captive free,
To break the bonds of sin, to lost death's fetters-
So send I you, to bring the lost to me.
So send I you-my strength to know in weakness,
My joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain,
To prove My power, My grace, My promised presence-
So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.
So send I you-to bear My cross with patience,
And then one day with joy to lay it down,
To hear My voice, "well done, My faithful servant-
Come, share My throne, My kingdom, and My crown!"
"As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you."

Soaring Spirit, set us free
from the tyranny of fear;
life of glorious liberty,
let your promised power appear:
drown the noise of Babel's tongues
in the murmur of the dove;
burn away our wasting wrongs
with the healing fire of love.
Unseen member of the dance
that unites the Trinity,
let the grace your presence grants
twine us in like mystery.
Breath of God, our lives inspire
till our hope and faith increase;
speak through us with tongues of fire;
send us forth to spread God's peace.

Softly and tenderly 
Jesus is calling 
Calling for you and for me 
See on the portals 
He's waiting and watching 
Watching for you and for me 
Come home, come home 
Ye who are weary, come home 
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling 
Calling, oh sinners, come home 
Why should we tarry 
When Jesus is pleading 
Pleading for you and for me 
Why should we linger 
And heed not his mercies 
Mercies for you and for me 
Come home, come home 
Ye who are weary, come home 
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling 
Calling, oh sinners, come home 
Oh, for that wonderful love 
He has promised 
Promised for you and for me 
Though we have sinned 
He has mercy and pardon 
Pardon for you and for me 
Come home, come home 
Ye who are weary, come home 
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling 
Calling, oh sinners, come home 

Softly and 
tenderly 
Jesus is 
calling,
Calling for 
you and for 
me;
See, on the 
portals He’s 
waiting and 
watching,
Watching for 
you and for 
me.

Softly 
fades the 
twilight 
ray,
Of the 
holy 
Sabbath 
day;
Gently as 
life’s 
setting 
sun,
When the 
Christian’s 
course is 
run.

Soldiers 
of 
Christ, 
arise, 
and 
put 
your 
armor 
on,
Strong 
in 
the 
strength 
which 
God 
supplies 
through 
His 
eternal 
Son.
Strong 
in 
the 
Lord 
of 
hosts, 
and 
in 
His 
mighty 
power,
Who 
in 
the 
strength 
of 
Jesus 
trusts 
is 
more 
than 
conqueror.

Soldiers 
of 
Christ, 
in 
truth 
arrayed,
A 
world 
in 
ruins 
needs 
your 
aid:
A 
world 
by 
sin 
destroyed 
and 
dead;
A 
world 
for 
which 
the 
Savior 
bled.

We are soldiers of King Jesus,
Clad in armor bright;
And we follow where He leads us,
Fighting for the right.

Soldiers of the cross, arise!
Lo! your Leader from the skies
Waves before you glory’s prize,
The prize of victory.
Seize your armor, gird it on;
Now the battle will be won;
See, the strife will soon be done;
Then struggle manfully.

Soldiers 
of 
the 
cross, 
arise!
Gird 
you 
with 
your 
armor 
bright!
Mighty 
are 
your 
enemies,
Hard 
the 
battle 
ye 
must 
fight.

Soldiers who to Christ belong,
Trust ye in His Word, be strong;
For His promises are sure,
His rewards for aye endure.

Soldiers, who are Christ’s below,
Strong in faith resist the foe:
Boundless is the pledged reward
Unto them who serve the Lord.

Some children see Him lily white,
The Baby Jesus born this night,
Some children see Him lily white,
With tresses soft and fair.
Some children see Him bronzed and brown,
The Lord of heav'n to earth come down;
Some children see Him bronzed and brown,
With dark and heavy hair.
Some children see Him almond-eyed,
This Savior whom we kneel beside,
Some children see Him almond-eyed,
With skin of yellow hue.
Some children see Him dark as they,
Sweet Mary's Son to whom we pray,
Some children see Him dark as they,
And, ah! they love Him, too!
The children in each diff'rent place
Will see the Baby Jesus' face
Like theirs, but bright with heav'nly grace,
And filled with holy light.
O lay aside each earthly thing,
And with thy heart as offering,
Come worship now the Infant King.
 'Tis love that's born tonight! 

Beams of Heaven, as I go,
Through this wilderness below,
Guide my feet in peaceful ways,
Turn my midnights into days;
When in the darkness I would grope,
Faith always sees a star of hope,
And soon from all life’s grief and danger,
I shall be free some day.

I do not know why oft ’round me
My hopes all shattered seem to be;
God’s perfect plan I cannot see,
But some day I’ll understand.

We shall reach the summer land,
Some sweet day, by and by;
We shall press the golden strand,
Some sweet day, by and by;
Oh, the loved ones watching there,
By the tree of life so fair,
Till we come their joy to share,
Some sweet day, by and by.

We shall reach the river side
Some sweet day, some sweet day;
We shall cross the stormy tide
Some sweet day, some sweet day;
We shall press the sands of gold,
While before our eyes unfold
Heaven’s splendors, yet untold,
Some sweet day, some sweet day.

Some sweet day my Lord will come,
Come to claim His own;
I shall meet Him face to face,
Before the Advent throne.

Some sweet morn the day will break,
Nevermore to sink in night.
Some sweet morn we shall awake,
Mid the everlasting light.

Somebody came and lifted me
Out of my sin and misery
Somebody came, O who could it be,
Who could it be but Jesus?

Somebody knows when your heart aches,
And ev’rything seems to go wrong;
Somebody knows when the shadows
Need chasing away with a song;
Somebody knows when you’re lonely,
Tired, discouraged and blue;
Somebody wants you to know Him,
And know that He dearly loves you.

We’re “counting" the blessings, our joys we record,
The wonderful mercies like sunbeams outpoured;
But let us remember while praising the Lord,
Somebody else needs a blessing.

Let your light shine wherever you go,
Someone is looking to you!
Brighter each day let it gleam and glow,
Someone is looking to you!

Falling in strength when oppressed by my foes,
Somebody knows, somebody knows,
Waiting for someone to banish my woes,
Somebody knows, ’tis Jesus.

Somebody’s knocking at your door,
Somebody’s knocking at your door,
O sinner, why don’t you answer?
Somebody’s knocking at your door.

Some day the journey will be done,
Somewhere we'll find a promised rest;
Some day all sorrow turn to joy,
Somewhere, some day we shall be blest.

Someone must tell the glad story,
The blessed old story so true,
Of love and of wonderful glory,
O say will that someone be you?

Someone shall go at the Master’s word
Over the sea to the lands afar,
Telling to those who have never heard
What His wonderful mercies are.
Shall it be you—shall it be I?
Who shall haste to tell what we know so well?
Shall you? Shall I?

Come, O come to the blessed Savior.
List, O list to His loving call.
Offering pardon, pardon from sin to all;
O come, He gives pardon from sin to all, to all.

Not now, but in the coming years,
It may be in the better land,
We'll read the meaning of our tears,
And there, some time, we'll understand.

A voice is heard in the dewy dawn,
And the call is sweet and low;
Come now, my child to the Shepherd’s fold,
Where the living waters flow;
But the gay heart answers in careless tones,
As light as the morning chime,
 “Let me live for the world just a little while,
I will come to God—sometime!"

Sometime all sorrows will be o’er,
Sometime!
All earthly care will be known no more!
Oh, what rejoicing on the golden shore,
Sometime, sometime soon!

Sometimes a light surprises the Christian while he sings;
It is the Lord, Who rises with healing in His wings:
When comforts are declining, He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining, to cheer it after rain.

SOMETIMES ALLELUIA,
SOMETIMES PRAISE THE LORD
SOMETIMES GENTLY SINGING,
OUR HEARTS IN ONE ACCORD
Oh let us lift our voices, 
Look toward the sky and start to sing
Oh let us now return His love,
Just let our voices ring
Oh let us feel His presence, 
Let the sound of praises fill the air
Oh let us sing the song of Jesus' love,
To people everywhere.
Oh let our joy be unconfined, 
Let us sing with freedom unrestrained
Let's take this feeling that we're feeling now, 
Outside these walls and let it rain.
Oh let the Spirit overflow,
As we are filled from head to toe.
We love you Father, Son and Holy Ghost, 
And we want this world to know.

  Sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child  
Sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child
  A Long Way From Home  
True Believer
  A Long Way From Home  

Sometimes that which I most desire 
Is not the best for me;
But God doth lead me through the fire,
To glorious victory.
Whate'er God's righteous, sov'reign will
Denies on earth to me,
Submissive, I shall trust Him still,
And He my guide shall be
For He doth know what's best for me,
'Mid all this worldly strife,
And will my Friend and Father be,
In ev'ry phase of life.
Then why should I distrust my Lord
And trust in mine own heart?
Why should I not believe His word,
And from all else depart?
I know if I draw nigh to God,
He will draw nigh to me;
But if I stray, he'll use the rod,
That I may righteous be.
And thus he shows His care for me,
And doeth all things well;
In goodness and in equity,
His love to me doth tell.
And when the storm of life is past,
And all these scenes are o'er,
He'll take me to Himself at last,
To reign for evermore.

The Son forsook the Father’s home
For mercy to lost man,
And did not scorn the virgin’s womb
To bear the sinner’s ban.

Son of a Virgin, Maker of thy Mother,
thou, Rod and Blossom from a Stem unstained,
now while a virgin fair of fame we honor,
hear our devotion!
Lo, on thy handmaid fell a twofold blessing,
who, in her body vanquishing the weakness,
in that same body, grace from heaven obtaining,
bore the world witness.
Death, nor the rending pains of death appalled her;
bondage and torment found her undefeated:
so by the shedding of her life attained she
heavenly guerdon.
Fountain of mercy, hear the prayers she offers;
purge our offenses, pardon our transgressions,
so that hereafter we to thee may render
praise with thanksgiving.
Thou, the All-Father, thou the One-Begotten,
thou Holy Spirit, Three in One co-equal,
glory be henceforth thine through all the ages,
world without ending.

The Son of Consolation!
Of Levi’s priestly line,
Filled with the Holy Spirit,
And fervent faith divine,
With lowly self-oblation,
For Christ an offering meet,
He laid his earthly riches
At the apostles’ feet.

The Son of David bowed to die,
For man’s transgression stricken;
The Father’s arm of power was nigh,
The Son of God to quicken.
Praise Him that He died for men:
Praise Him that He rose again.

The Son of God goes forth to war,
A kingly crown to gain;
His blood red banner streams afar:
Who follows in His train?
Who best can drink his cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain,
Who patient bears his cross below,
He follows in His train.

Son of God, eternal Savior,
Source of life and truth and grace,
Son of Man, Whose birth incarnate
Hallows all our human race,
Thou, our Head Who, throned in glory,
For Thine own dost ever plead,
Fill us with Thy love and pity;
Heal our wrongs, and help our need.

Son of God, if thy free grace
Again has raised me up,
Called me still to seek thy face,
And given me back my hope:
Still thy timely help afford,
And all thy loving kindness show:
Keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
And never let me go!
By me, O my Saviour, stand
In sore temptation's hour;
Save me with thine outstretched hand,
And show forth all thy power;
O be mindful of thy word,
Thy all-sufficient grace bestow:
Keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
And never let me go!
Give me, Lord, a holy fear,
And fix it in my heart,
That I may from evil near
With timely care depart;
Sin be more than hell abhorred;
Till thou destroy the tyrant foe,
Keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
And never let me go!
Never let me leave thy breast,
From thee, my Saviour, stray;
Thou art my support and rest,
My true and living Way;
My exceeding great reward,
In heav'n above, and earth below:
Keep me, keep me, gracious Lord,
And never let me go!

The Son of Man from Jordan rose,
And prayed to God above;
When lo, the opening heav’ns disclose
A swift descending Dove.

Son of the carpenter, receive
This humble work of mine;
Worth to my meanest labor give,
By joining it to Thine.

Son of the Highest, deign to cast
On us a pitying eye,
Thou Who repentant Magdalene
Didst call to joys on high.

Sons we are through God's election
Who in Jesus Christ alone
By eternal destination
Sov'regin grace we here receive
Lord thy mercy, Lord thy mercy
Does both grace and glory give

A song and a carol for Christmastide
Of the Prince of the Golden Shore,
Whom armies of light, in their vesture bright,
Love, serve, and adore evermore.
Far, far below, where the sunbeams glow
On a realm of His wide domain,
Sad ruin and woe, hath come through His foe,
With trouble and sorrow and pain.

Not in darkness nor in mystery,
No depth of heart or mind,
Nowhere in heav’n or earth or hell
Can I run and Thou not find;
Transcendent thoughts too deep for me
Surround on every side.
Thy mighty wisdom, O my God,
Moves ocean, wind and tide.

A song of spring once more we sing
As winter flies away,
And changeful hours bring sun and showers
To weave a crown for May;
With heart and voice we all rejoice,
On this returning day.

Songs anew of honor framing,
Sing ye to the Lord alone;
All His wondrous works proclaiming,
Jesus wondrous works hath done!
Glorious victory, glorious victory,
His right hand and arm have won.

Songs of praise the angels sang,
Heav’n with alleluias rang,
When creation was begun,
When God spoke and it was done.

Songs of thankfulness and praise,
Jesus, Lord, to Thee we raise,
Manifested by the star
To the sages from afar;
Branch of royal David’s stem
In Thy birth at Bethlehem;
Anthems be to Thee addressed,
God in man made manifest.

The seed I have scattered in springtime with weeping,
And watered with tears and with dews from on high;
Another may shout when the harvester’s reaping,
Shall gather my grain in the “sweet by and by."

Sons of labor, dear to Jesus,
To your homes and work again;
Go with brave hearts back to duty,
Face the peril, bear the pain.
Be your dwellings ne’er so lowly,
Yet remember, by your bed,
That the Son of God most holy
Had not where to lay His head.

Sons we are through God's election
Who in Jesus Christ alone
By eternal destination
Sov'regin grace we here receive
Lord thy mercy, Lord thy mercy
Does both grace and glory give

Soon all earthly strife will vanish,
Soon I’ll reach the heav’nly strand;
Oh, what joy will sorrow banish
When before my Lord I stand.

Soon shall we see the glorious morning!
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!
Sinners, attend the notes of warning!
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!
The resurrection day draws near,
The King of saints shall soon appear,
And high His royal standard rear:
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!

Soon will our Savior from Heaven appear,
Sweet is the hope and its power to cheer;
All will be changed by a glimpse of His face;
This is the goal at the end of our race.

To You, O Lord, we lift our voice;
We call from this world of pain.
You left us with Your blessing, Lord,
And promised to come again.
You promised to come again.

Soul, adorn thyself with gladness,
Leave behind all gloom and sadness;
Come into the daylight's splendor,
There with joy thy praises render
Unto Him whose grace unbounded
Hath this woundrous supper founded.
High o'er all the heavens He reigneth,
Yet to dwell with thee He deigneth.

We know not the trials before us,
But Jesus takes thought for them all,
And trusting the aid of His counsel,
We never, no, never can fall;
We know not the trials before us,
Or what on the morrow may be,
But sweet is the soul cheering promise,
“My grace is sufficient for thee."

Souls in death and darkness lying,
Where no light has broken through;
Souls that Jesus bought by dying,
Whom His soul in travail knew;
Thousand voices call us o’er the waters blue;
Thousand voices call us o’er the waters blue.

Soul of Jesus, make me whole,
Meek and contrite make my soul;
Thou most stainless Soul divine,
Cleanse this sordid soul of mine,
Hallow this my contrite heart,
Purify my every part;
Soul of Jesus, hallow me,

Soul of my Saviour,
sanctify my breast;
Body of Christ,
be thou my saving guest;
Blood of my Saviour,
bathe me in thy tide,
wash me with water
flowing from thy side.
Strength and protection
may thy passion be;
O blessed Jesus,
hear and answer me;
deep in thy wounds, Lord,
hide and shelter me;
so shall I never,
never part from thee.
Guard and defend me
from the foe malign;
in death's dread moments
make me only thine;
call me, and bid me
come to thee on high,
where I may praise thee
with thy saints for ay.

Soul, what return has God, thy Savior,
For all He gives thee day by day?
Oh, hast thou in thy gift a favor
That can delight and please Him?--Say!
The best of offerings He requires:
Thy heart it is that He desires.

Souls of men, why will ye scatter
Like a crowd of frightened sheep?
Foolish hearts, why will ye wander
From a love so true and deep?

Souls of men, why will ye scatter
Like a crowd of frightened sheep?
Foolish hearts, why will ye wander
From a love so true and deep?

Sound aloud Jehovah's praises,
Tell abroad the aweful Name!
Heaven the ceaseless anthem raises;
Let the earth her God proclaim,
God, the hope of every nation,
God, the source of consolation,
Holy, blessed Trinity.
This the Name from ancient ages
Hidden in its dazzling light;
This the Name that Kings and sages
Prayed and strove to know aright,
Through God's wondrous Incarnation
Now revealed the world's salvation,
Ever blessed Trinity.
Into this great name and holy
We all tribes and tongues baptise;
Thus the Highest owns the lowly,
Homeward, heavenward, bids them rise,
Gathers them from every nation,
Bids them join in adoration
Of the blessed Trinity.
In this Name the heart rejoices,
Pouring forth its secret prayer;
In this Name we lift our voices,
And our common faith declare,
Offering praise and supplication
And the thankful life's oblation
To the blessed Trinity.
Still thy name o'er earth and ocean
Shall be carried, 'God is Love,'
Whispered by the heart's devotion,
Echoed by the choirs above,
Hallowed through all worlds for ever,
Lord, of life the only giver,
Blessed, glorious Trinity.

Sound, sound the truth abroad;
Bear ye the Word of God
Through the wide world;
Tell what our Lord hath done,
Tell how the day is won,
Tell from his lofty throne
Satan is hurled.

Sound the alarm! Let the watchman cry!
“Up! for the day of the Lord is nigh;
Who will escape from the wrath to come?
Who have a place in the soul’s bright home?"

Sovereign of all the worlds on high,
Allow my humble claim;
Nor, while a worm would raise its head,
Disdain a Father's name.
My Father, God! how sweet the sound!
How tender and how dear!
Not all the harmony of heav'n
Could so delight the ear.
Come sacred Spirit, seal thy name
On my expanding heart,
And show that in Jehovah's grace,
I share a filial part.
Cheered by a signal so divine,
Unwav'ring I believe,
And, Abba, Father, humbly cry,
Nor can the sign deceive.

A Sov’reign Protector I have,
Unseen, yet forever at hand,
Unchangeably faithful to save,
Almighty to rule and command.
He smiles, and my comforts abound;
His grace as the dew shall descend;
And walls of salvation surround
The soul He delights to defend.

Sow in the morn thy seed,
At eve hold not thy hand;
To doubt and fear give thou no heed,
Broadcast it o’er the land.

Sow the seed beside all waters,
North and south and east and west,
That our toiling sons and daughters
In the harvest may be blessed.
Tell the tidings of salvation
 ’Mid the storms of Labrador;
Speak the word of consolation
By the lone Pacific shore.

The sower went forth sowing,
The seed in secret slept
Through weeks of faith and patience,
Till out the green blade crept;
And warmed by golden sunshine,
And fed by silver rain,
At last the fields were whitened
To harvest once again.
O praise the heavenly Sower,
Who gave the fruitful seed,
And watched and watered duly,
And ripened for our need.

Sowing by word and deed,
Scattering precious seed,
Telling the story of His love;
Gladly the news proclaim,
Jesus has come to reign,
Wonderful Savior from above.

The spacious firmament on high,
With all the blue ethereal sky,
And spangled heavens, a shining frame
Their great Original proclaim.
Th’unwearied sun, from day to day,
Does his Creator’s powers display,
And publishes to every land
The work of an Almighty Hand.

The spacious heavens declare
The glory of our God,
The firmament displays
His handiwork abroad;
Day unto day proclaims His might,
And night His wisdom tells to night.

Speak for Jesus; He hath touched you,
Raised you from the death of sin;
Use for Him the life He gives you;
Rise, and precious jewels win!

Speak to me only of Jesus,
Tell of the cross that He wore,
Tell of the shame and the sorrow,
Tell of the burden He bore.

Speak to my soul, dear Jesus,
Speak now in tend’rest tone;
Whisper in loving kindness,
“Thou art not left alone."
Open my heart to hear Thee,
Quickly to hear Thy voice,
Fill Thou my soul with praises,
Let me in Thee rejoice.

Speak, Lord, in the stillness,
While I wait on Thee;
Hushed my heart to listen
In expectancy.
Speak, O blessed Master,
In this quiet hour;
Let me see Thy face, Lord,
Feel Thy touch of power.
For the words Thou speakest,
 'They are life' indeed;
Living Bread from heaven,
Now on my spirit feed!
All to Thee is yielded,
I am not my own;
Blissful, glad surrender -
I am Thine alone.
Speak, Thy servant heareth!
Be not silent, Lord;
Waits my soul upon Thee
For the quickening word!
Fill me with the knowledge
Of Thy glorious will;
All Thine own good pleasure
In Thy child fulfil.

Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly calling,
 “Who will go and work for Me today?
Who will bring to Me the lost and dying?
Who will point them to the narrow way?"

Speak, O Lord, Thy servant heareth,
To Thy Word I now give heed;
Life and spirit Thy Word beareth,
All Thy Word is true indeed.
Death’s dread pow’r in me is rife;
Jesus, may Thy Word of Life
Fill my soul with love’s strong fervor
That I cling to Thee forever.

Speed away, speed away, on your mission of 
light,
To the lands that are lying in darkness 
and night;
’Tis the Master’s command; go ye forth in 
His Name,
The wonderful Gospel of Jesus proclaim;
Take your lives in your hand, to the work 
while ’tis day,
Speed away, speed away, speed away.

Speed for thy life to the mountain,
Slight not the message divine,
Danger and death are before thee,
Haste, while the hours are thine.

To the millions living o’er the deep, 
deep sea
Speed the light, speed the light;
To their cry of pity dare we heedless 
be?
Speed the light, O speed the light.

Speed Thy servants, Savior, speed 
them;
Thou art Lord of winds and waves;
They were bound, but Thou hast freed 
them;
Now they go to free the slaves:
Be Thou with them, ’tis Thine arm 
alone that saves.
Be Thou with them, ’tis Thine arm 
alone that saves.

Weary soul by sin oppressed,
Spend one hour with Jesus;
He will give your spirit rest,
Spend one hour with Jesus:
He has felt your grief before,
Numbered all your sorrows o’er,
He will ev’ry joy restore;
Spend one hour with Jesus.

Spirit blest, Who art adored
With the Father and the Word,
One eternal God and Lord:
Hear us, Holy Spirit.

Spirit divine, attend our 
prayer,
And make our heart Thy home;
Descend with all Thy gracious 
power;
Come, Holy Spirit, come.

Spirit of faith, come down, 
reveal the things of God,
And make to us the Godhead 
known, and witness with the 
blood.
 ’Tis Thine the blood to apply 
and give us eyes to see,
Who did for every sinner die 
hath surely died for me.

Spirit of God in the clear running water
Blowing to greatness the trees on the hill.
Spirit of God in the finger of morning:
Fill the earth, bring it to birth,
And blow where you will.
Blow, blow, blow till I be
But the breath of the Spirit blowing in me.
Down in the meadow the willows are moaning
Sheep in the pastureland cannot lie still.
Spirit of God, creation is groaning:
Fill the earth, bring it to birth,
And blow where you will.
Blow, blow, blow till I be
But the breath of the Spirit blowing in me.

Spirit of God within me,
possess my human frame;
fan the dull embers of my heart,
stir up the living flame.
Strive till that image Adam lost,
new-minted and restored,
in shining splendor brightly bears
the likeness of the Lord.
Spirit of truth within me,
possess my thought and mind;
lighten anew the inward eye
by Satan rendered blind;
shine on the words that wisdom speaks,
and grant me power to see
the truth made known to all in Christ,
and in that truth be free.
Spirit of love within me,
possess my hands and heart;
break through the bonds of self-concern
that seeks to stand apart;
grant me the love that suffers long,
that hopes, believes and bears,
the love fulfilled in sacrifice
that cares as Jesus cares.
Spirit of life within me,
possess this life of mine;
come as the wind of heaven's breath,
come as the fire divine!
Spirit of Christ, the living Lord,
reign in this house of clay,
till from its dust with Christ I rise
to everlasting day.

Spirit of God, descend upon 
my heart;
Wean it from earth; through 
all its pulses move;
Stoop to my weakness, mighty 
as Thou art;
And make me love Thee as I 
ought to love.

Spirit of God, that moved 
of old
Upon the waters’ darkened 
face,
Come, when our faithless 
hearts are cold,
And stir them with an 
inward grace.

Spirit of holiness, 
descend:
Thy people wait for 
Thee;
Thine ear in kind 
compassion lend;
Let us Thy mercy see.

Spirit of Jesus, who didst move
The hearts and pens of men to write
The story of the world's true Light,
His words of power and deeds of love;
We thank thee for those scribes of old
Who, while apostles journeyed still
Their worldwide witness to fulfil,
Set down the glorious tale they told;
We thank thee for the writers three,
Who from such fleeting records wrought
The first three gospels, and so taught
The truth for every age to see.
Then, as faith ripened, thou didst call
A fourth evangelist, to show
The Christ whom souls had come to know
As Way, as Truth, as Life, for all.
Spirit of Jesus, give thy grace
To us who read, that so we may
Know him more fully day by day
Until we see him face to face.

Spirit of the living God
Fall fresh on me
Spirit of the living God
Fall fresh on me

Spirit of truth, essential God,
Who didst thine ancient saints inspire,
Shed in their hearts thy love abroad
And touch their hallowed lips with fire;
Our God from all eternity,
World without end we worship thee.
Still we believe, almighty Lord,
Whose presence fills both earth and heaven,
The meaning of the written word
Is by thy inspiration given;
Thou only dost thyself explain
The secret mind of God to man.
Come then, divine Interpreter,
The scriptures to our hearts apply;
And, taught by thee, we God revere,
Him in Three Persons magnify,
In each the Triune God adore,
Who was, and is, for evermore.

Spirit of wisdom, turn our eyes
From earth and earthly vanities
To heavenly truth and love;
Spirit of understanding true,
Our souls with heavenly light endue
To seek the things above.
Spirit of counsel, be our guide;
Teach us, by earthly struggles tried,
Our heavenly crown to win;
Spirit of fortitude, thy power
Be with us in temptation's hour,
To keep us pure from sin.
Spirit of knowledge, lead our feet
In thine own paths, so safe and sweet,
By angel footsteps trod;
Where thou art guardian true shalt be,
Spirit of gentle piety,
To keep us close to God.
Through all our life be ever near,
Spirit of God's most holy fear,
In our heart's inmost shrine;
Our souls with aweful reverence fill,
To worship his most holy will,
All-righteous and divine.
So lead us, Lord, through peace or strife,
Onward to everlasting life,
To win our high reward:
So may we fight our lifelong fight,
Strong in thine own unearthly might,
And reign with Christ our Lord.

Spirit, strength of 
all the weak,
Giving courage to 
the meek,
Teaching faltering 
hopes to speak;
Hear us, Holy 
Spirit.

Spouse of Christ, 
in arms contending
O’er each clime 
beneath the sun,
Blend with prayers 
for help ascending
Notes of praise 
for triumphs won.

Spread, O 
spread, thou 
mighty Word,
Spread the 
kingdom of the 
Lord,
Wheresoe’er His 
breath has 
given,
Life to beings 
meant for 
Heaven.

Springs and 
streams no 
longer bless
All the dry 
and thirsty 
land;
Fertile fields 
in verdant 
dress
God converts 
to desert 
sand;
For that they 
who dwell 
therein
Turn to 
wickedness and 
sin.

Stalwart as pillars bearing high their burden,
So do the Church's doctors stay the temple
Where truth abideth, on the one Foundation
Grounded for ever.
O faithful stewards in God's holy household,
Out of your treasure new and old things bringing,
Still do your writings to the Light of ages
Steadfastly witness.
Souls wise and loyal to the Spirit's leading,
Bravely ye battled for the faith delivered,
While of its ageless mysteries ye furnished
New understanding.
Now with unclouded gaze ye are beholding
Him of whose face ye strained to catch the vision;
To whom be glory, Father, Son, and Spirit,
Through endless ages.

When the 
storms of 
life are 
raging,
Stand by me 
 (stand by 
me);
When the 
storms of 
life are 
raging,
Stand by me 
 (stand by 
me);
When the 
world is 
tossing me
Like a ship 
upon the sea
Thou Who 
rulest wind 
and water,
Stand by me 
 (stand by 
me).

We’ll 
stand by 
the Bible, 
God’s 
message to 
man,
Revealing 
His love 
in 
Redemption’s 
great 
plan;
It tells 
how death 
entered 
with sin 
and the 
fall,
Of life 
freely 
offered 
through 
Jesus to 
all.

Working 
in the 
vineyard,
Working 
all the 
day,
Never be 
discouraged,
Only 
watch 
and 
pray;
Do your 
duty 
nobly,
Heart 
and hand 
unite,

Stand 
fast 
for 
Christ 
thy 
Savior!
Stand 
fast 
whate’er 
betide!
Keep 
thou 
the 
Faith, 
unstained, 
unshamed,
By 
keeping 
at His 
side;
Be 
faithful, 
ever 
faithful,
Where’er 
thy 
lot be 
cast,

O Christian, awake! ’tis the Master’s command;
With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

Stand 
the 
omnipotent 
decree!
Jehovah’s 
will 
be 
done!
Nature’s 
end 
we 
wait 
to 
see,
And 
hear 
her 
final 
groan.
Let 
this 
earth 
dissolve, 
and 
blend
In 
death 
the 
wicked 
and 
the 
just;
Let 
those 
ponderous 
orbs 
descend,
And 
grind 
us 
into 
dust.

Stand up and bless the Lord
Ye people of His choice;
Stand up and bless the Lord your God
With heart and soul and voice.

Stand up, my soul, shake off thy fears,
And gird the Gospel armor on,
March to the gates of endless joy,
Where thy great Captain-Savior’s gone.

Stand, 
soldier 
of 
the 
cross,
Thy 
high 
allegiance 
claim,
And 
vow 
to 
hold 
the 
world 
but 
loss
For 
thy 
Redeemer’s 
Name.

Not my brother, nor my sister, but it’s me, O Lord,
Standin’ in the need of prayer;
Not my brother, nor my sister, but it’s me, O Lord,
Standin’ in the need of prayer.

Standing at the portal
Of the opening year,
Words of comfort meet us,
Hushing every fear;
Spoken thru the silence
By our Savior’s voice,
Tender, strong and faithful,
Making us rejoice.

Standing in the marketplace,
Jesus watched the children play,
where the eastern sunshine fell
all the merry summer day.

There’s a beautiful star, a beautiful star,
The weary travelers have followed far,
Shining so brightly all the way,
Till it stood o’er the place where the young Child lay.

Lo! the star in the East! over Bethlehem’s plain,
It shines as a guide to the place
Where the weary, worn trav’ler his hopes may attain,
And worship that Infant of Days.
While forth from their treasures, frankincense and gold,
And the costliest spices they bring.
For in their distant land it had long been foretold,
The birth of that glorious King.

think of that star of long ago
That lighted the wanderers’ path below;
In faith I look up, and o’er me I see
That star in its beauty still shining for me.

Star of morn and even,
Sun of Heav’n’s heaven,
Savior high and dear,
Toward us turn Thine ear;
Through whate’er may come,
Thou canst lead us home.

Star of our hope! He’ll soon appear,
The last loud trumpet speaks Him near;
Hail Him, all saints, from pole to pole—
How welcome to the faithful soul!

The star proclaims the King is here;
But, Herod, why this senseless fear?
He takes no realms of earth away
Who gives the realms of heav’nly day.

The starry firmament on high,
And all the glories of the sky,
Yet shine not to Thy praise, O Lord,
So brightly as Thy written Word.

Stars all bright are beaming
from the skies above,
nature's face all gleaming,
shines with heaven's own love.

Stars of evening, softly gleaming
In the fading west,
With your heavenly light is streaming
Hope to hearts oppressed!
Toil is over, cease from sorrow,
Till tomorrow
Sleep and rest!

Stars of glory shine more brightly,
Purer be the moonlight's beam,
Glide ye hours and moments lightly,
Swiftly down time's deep'ning stream.
Bring the hour that banished sadness,
Brought redemption down to earth,
When the shepherds heard with gladness
Tidings of a Saviour's birth.
See the shepherds quickly rising,
Hast'ning to the humble stall,
And the newborn Infant prizing,
As the mighty Lord of All.
Lowly now they bend before him
In His helpless infant state.
Firmly faithful we adore Him,
And His greatness celebrate.
See how Mary loves her Boychild
In the light of Bethlehem.
Lowly ox and ass breathe warmly
On the little Lord of All.
Now the world is hushed in stillness,
In the joy of knowing God is near!
Hope and love have come to dwell here,
Driving out the night of fear.
Hark! The swell of heav'nly voices
Peals along the vaulted sky.
Angels sing while earth rejoices,
 "Glory to our God on high!
Glory in the highest heaven.
Peace to lowly ones on earth.
Joy to these and bliss be given
In the great Redeemer's birth." 

Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright,
Filled with celestial splendor and light,
These that, where night never followeth day,
Raise the “Thrice Holy" song ever and aye.

Stay, my child, my body sharing.
Girlhood's peace from me is torn;
well I know a mother's fearing,
hope miscarried, joy stillborn.
Lullaby, lullaby,
God has heard a mother's cry,
lullaby.
Grow, my child, in body chosen
by the God who made the earth;
mine the answer, in confusion,
young, unready to give birth.
Lullaby, lullaby,
God awaits a baby's cry,
lullaby.
Sleep, my child, for love surrounds us;
we have not been left alone.
Though disgrace and shame may hound us,
Joseph stays and shields his own.
Lullaby, lullaby,
Word of God in baby's cry,
lullaby.
Wake, my child, the world is crying,
calls you, evil's power to cross;
opens you to early dying,
motherhood's most dreaded loss.
Lullaby, lullaby,
pain of God in mother's cry,
lullaby.
Go, my child, grace protect you,
shape your living, fill your breath;
by its power to resurrect you,
break the grip of fear and death.
Lullaby, lullaby,
hope for all in mother's cry,
lullaby.

Stay, Master, stay, upon this heavenly hill;
A little longer, let us linger still;
With all the mighty ones of old beside,
Near to God’s holy presence still abide;
Before the throne of light we trembling stand,
And catch a glimpse into the spirit land.

Stay, Thou insulted Spirit, stay,
Though I have done Thee such despite,
Nor cast the sinner quite away,
Nor take Thine everlasting flight.

Praise ye the Lord, joyfully sound hosanna,
Praise the Lord with glad acclaim.
Lift up your hearts unto His throne with gladness,
Magnify His holy Name.
Marching along under His banner bright,
Trusting in His mercy as we go,
His light divine tenderly o’er us will shine,
We shall be guided by His hand now and forever.

Steady, brother, steady, though the storm winds rise,
And darkness gather o’er you and it veil your skies;
Keep your course unwavered, and be brave, be true;
Fear not while the Master holds the helm with you.

Steal away, steal away,
steal away to Jesus.
Steal away, steal away home,
I ain't got long to stay here.
My Lord, he calls me,
he calls me by the thunder.
The trumpet sounds within my soul;
I ain't got long to stay here.
Green trees are bending,
the sinner stands a-trembling.
The trumpet sounds within my soul;
I ain't got long to stay here.
My Lord, he calls me,
he calls me by the lightning.
The trumpet sounds within my soul;
I ain't got long to stay here.

Stealing from the world away,
We are come to seek Thy face;
Kindly meet us, Lord, we pray,
Grant us Thy reviving grace.

’Tis so sweet to walk with Jesus,
Step by step and day by day;
Stepping in His very footprints,
Walking with Him all the way.

The steps of those whom He approves
Are ordered by the Lord;
And though they fall, held by His hand,
They yet shall be restored.

Still nigh me, O my Saviour, stand,
And guard in fierce temptation's hour;
Hide in the hollow of thy hand,
Show forth in me thy saving power;
Still be thine arm my sure defence;
Nor earth nor hell shall pluck me thence.
Still let thy love point out my way:
How wondrous things thy love hath wrought!
Still lead me, lest I go astray;
Direct my work, inspire my thought;
And, if I fall, soon may I hear
Thy voice, and know that Love is near,
In suffering be thy love my peace,
In weakness be thy love my power;
And when the storms of life shall cease,
Jesus, in that tremendous hour,
In death as life be thou my guide,
And save me, who for me hast died.

Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,
When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,
Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.

To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn,
He’s fairer than the glory of the gold and purple dawn;
He’s all my fancy pictures in its fairest dreams, and more,
Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.

Still will we trust, though earth seem dark and dreary,
And the heart faint beneath His chastening rod;
Though rough and steep our pathway, worn and weary,
Still will we trust in God!

Still with Thee, O my God,
I would desire to be;
By day, by night, at home, abroad,
I would be still with Thee.

Stop, poor sinner! stop and think
Before you farther go!
Will you sport upon the brink
Of everlasting woe?
Once again I charge you, stop!
For, unless you warning take,
Ere you are aware, you drop
Into the burning lake!

O courage, my soul, and let us journey on,
For tho’ the night is dark, it won’t be very long.
O thanks be to God, the morning light appears,
And the storm is passing over, Hallelujah!

The sweetest story told on earth,
Or heard in Heav’n above,
Is told of Jesus and His birth,
Of Jesus and His love.

O tell me the story that never grows old,
The story of One Whom the prophets foretold;
The Horn of salvation, the Scepter and Star,
The Light in the darkness they saw from afar.

Strait is the gate to all that come,
And narrow is the way,
Which leads unto the heav’nly home,
Where yet is room for thee,
Where yet is room for thee.

In fancy I stood by the shore, one day,
Of the beautiful murm’ring sea;
I saw the great crowds as they thronged the way
Of the Stranger of Galilee;
I saw how the man who was blind from birth,
In a moment was made to see;
The lame was made whole by the matchless skill
Of the Stranger of Galilee.

Stretched on the cross, the Savior dies,
Hark! His expiring groans arise;
See, how the sacred crimson tide
Flows from His hands, His feet, His side.

Stricken, smitten, and afflicted,
See Him dying on the tree!
’Tis the Christ by man rejected;
Yes, my soul, ’tis He, ’tis He!
’Tis the long expected prophet,
David’s Son, yet David’s Lord;
Proofs I see sufficient of it:
’Tis a true and faithful Word.

The strife is o’er, the battle done;
The victory of life is won;
The song of triumph has begun: Alleluia!

Strive aright when God doth call thee,
When He draws thee by His grace,
Cast off all that would enthrall thee,
And deter thee from the race.

Strong Captain, in thy holy ranks
We take our places now:
Give us the mood befitting those
Who make so great a vow.
For foolishness it were to come
In hardihood of pride,
And cowardice it were to come
And wish to be untried.
We'll not mistrust our want of strength
Nor trust our strength of will;
Our only confidence, that thou
Believest in us still.
Make, then, our task to match our strength,
Our strength to match our task,
And make us unafraid to do
Whatever thou wilt ask.

Strong Son of God, immortal love,
Whom we, that have not seen Thy face,
By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
Believing where we cannot prove.

Strong, righteous Man of Galilee,
Robed with Thy peace we follow Thee:
In temple court, Thy cleansing rod;
On Pharisees, the scorn of God.
Robed with Thy peace we follow Thee,
Strong, righteous Man of Galilee.

Stupendous height of heavenly love,
Of pitying tenderness divine;
It brought the Saviour from above,
It caused the springing day to shine;
The Sun of Righteousness to appear,
And gild our gloomy hemisphere.
God did in Christ himself reveal,
To chase our darkness by his light,
Our sin and ignorance dispel,
Direct our wandering feet aright;
And bring our souls, with pardon blest,
To realms of everlasting rest.
Come then, O Lord, thy light impart,
The faith that bids our terrors cease;
Into thy love direct my heart,
Into thy way of perfect peace;
And cheer my soul, of death afraid,
And guide me through the dreadful shade.
Answer thy mercy's whole design,
My God incarnated for me;
My spirit make thy radiant shrine,
My light and full salvation be;
And through the darkened vale unknown
Conduct me to thy dazzling throne.

Such as in God the Lord do trust
As Mount Sion shall firmly stand,
And be removed at no hand,
The Lord will count them right and just,
So that they shall be sure
Forever to endure.

The summer days are come again;
Once more the glad earth yields
Her golden wealth of ripening grain,
And breadth of clover fields,
And deepening shade of summer woods,
And glow of summer air,
And winging thoughts, and happy moods
Of love and joy and prayer.

Summer suns are glowing over land and sea;
Happy light is flowing, bountiful and free;
Everything rejoices in the mellow rays;
Earth’s ten thousand voices swell the psalm of praise.

Summer suns are glowing over land and sea;
Happy light is flowing, bountiful and free;
Everything rejoices in the mellow rays;
Earth’s ten thousand voices swell the psalm of praise.

The sun is on the land and sea,
The day begun;
Our morning hymn begins with Thee,
Blest Three in One;
Our praise shall rise continually
Till day is done.

The sun is sinking fast,
The daylight dies;
Let love awake, and pay
Her evening sacrifice.

We are marching on with shield and banner bright,
We will work for God and battle for the right,
We will praise His Name, rejoicing in His might,
And we’ll work till Jesus calls.
In the Sunday School our army we prepare,
As we rally round our blessed standard there,
And the Savior’s cross we early learn to bear,
While we work till Jesus comes.

There is sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my Light.

Supported by the Word,
Though in himself a worm,
The servant of the Lord
Can wondrous acts perform:
Without dismay he boldly treads
Where’er the path of duty leads.

There stands a Rock on shores of time
That rears to Heaven its head sublime.
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest
Who find within this cleft a rest.

A pilgrim was I, and a wandering,
In the cold night of sin I did roam,
When Jesus the kind Shepherd found me,
And now I am on my way home.

Surely it is God who saves me;
I shall trust and have no fear.
For the Lord defends and shields me
and his saving help is near.
So rejoice as you draw water
from salvation's healing spring;
in the day of your deliverance
thank the Lord, his mercies sing.
Make God's deeds known to the peoples:
tell our his exalted name.
Praise the Lord, who has done great things;
all his works God's might proclaim.
Zion, lift your voice in singing;
for with you has come to dwell,
in your very midst, the great and
Holy One of Israel.

Surrounded by a host of foes,
Stormed by a host of foes within,
Nor swift to flee, nor strong t’oppose,
Single, against hell, earth, and sin,
Single, yet undismayed, I am;
I dare believe in Jesus’ Name.

Over the hilltops, down from the skies,
Coming from glory—lift up your eyes!
While we are watching, and while we pray,
A mighty revival is sweeping this way.

Sweet and clear the birds are singing,
At Easter dawn.
Hark, O hear, the bells are ringing,
On Easter morn!
And the song that they sing,
That good news we hear them ring,
Is “Christ the Lord is risen, is risen."

Sweet assurance, Thou hast sealed me
With Thy precious blood divine;
And I know, for Thou hast told me,
I in life or death am Thine.

There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

Sweet feast of love divine!
’Tis grace that makes us free
To feed upon this bread and wine,
In memory, Lord, of Thee.

Sweet flow’rets of the martyr band,
So early plucked by cruel hand;
Like rosebuds by a tempest torn,
As breaks the light of summer morn.

Sweet is the breath of morning air;
Sweet is the dawn, when skies are fair;
Sweeter by far than aught beside
In God’s own favor to abide.

Sweet is the memory of Thy grace,
My God, my heav’nly King;
Let age to age Thy righteousness
In sounds of glory sing.

Sweet is the sunlight after rain,
And sweet the sleep which follows pain;
And sweetly steals the Sabbath rest
Upon the world’s work-wearied breast.

Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
To praise Thy Name, give thanks and sing,
To show Thy love by morning light
And talk of all Thy truth at night.

There comes to my heart one sweet strain,
A glad and a joyous ,
I sing it again and again,
Sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.

Sweet place; sweet place alone!
The court of God most high,
The heaven of heavens, the throne
Of spotless majesty!

Sweet Rivers of Redeeming Love
Lie just before my eye;
Had I the pinions of a dove
I'd to those regions fly!
1'd rise superior to my pain 
With joy outstrip the wind;
I'd cross death's cold and stormy main,
And leave the world behind.
While I'm in prison here below,
In anguish, pain, and smart,
Ofttimes those troubles I forego,
When love surrounds my heart;
In darkest shadows of the night
Faith mounts the upper sky;
I there behold my heart's delight
And would rejoice to die.
O come, my Savior, come away,
And bear me through the sky,
Nor let the chariot wheels delay 
Make haste, and brings it nigh;
I hope to see thy glorious face,
And in thy image shine,
To triumph in victorious grace,
And be forever thine.
Then will I tune my harp of gold
To my eternal King;
In ages that can ne'er be told,
Will make his praises ring.
All hail, triumphant Son of God,
Who died on Calvary,
And saved me, with His precious blood,
From endless misery!
Ten thousand, thousand join in one
To praise th'eternal Three,
Prostrate before thy dazzling throne,
In deep humility;
They rise and tune their harps of gold;
And sweet th'immortal lyre,
In ages that can ne'er be told,
Shall raise thy praises higher.

Sweet sacrament divine,
hid in thy earthly home,
lo, round thy lowly shrine,
with suppliant hearts we come;
Jesus, to thee our voice we raise,
in songs of love and heartfelt praise,
sweet sacrament divine,
sweet sacrament divine.
Sweet sacrament of peace,
dear home of ev'ry heart,
where restless yearnings cease,
and sorrows all depart;
there in thine ear all trustfully
we tell our tale of misery,
sweet sacrament of peace,
sweet sacrament of peace.
Sweet sacrament of rest,
ark from the ocean's roar,
within thy shelter blest
soon may we reach the shore;
save us, for still the tempest raves,
save, lest we sink beneath the waves,
sweet sacrament of rest,
sweet sacrament of rest.
Sweet sacrament divine,
earth's light and jubilee,
in thy far depths doth shine
thy Godhead's majesty;
sweet light, so shine on us, we pray,
that worthless joys may fade away,
sweet sacrament divine,
sweet sacrament divine.

Sweet Savior, bless us ere we go;
Thy Word into our minds instill,
And make our lukewarm hearts to glow
With lowly love and fervent will.

Sweet Savior! in Thy pitying grace
Thy sweetness to our souls impart;
Thou only Lover of our race
Give healing to the wounded heart;
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants’ cry,
And save us, Jesu! lest we die.

Oh, beautiful story of Jesus our Lord,
That brightens and hallows each page of His Word,
It tells us how humble and lowly His birth,
How many His trials and sorrows on earth.

Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the cross we spend,
Life and health and peace possessing
From the sinner’s dying Friend.

Hear sweet voices from above,
Fill thy hands and go with love,
To the weary as they wait, so late;
In the name of Christ your King,
Go and sweetly, sweetly sing,
Go and wipe their tears away, and pray.

O the love of Jesus means so much to me,
Keeps my pathway shining, keeps me pure and free;
More and more I praise Him, for He seems to be
Sweeter as the days go by.

Of Jesus’ love that sought me, when I was lost in sin;
Of wondrous grace that brought me back to His fold again;
Of heights and depths of mercy, far deeper than the sea,
And higher than the heavens, my theme shall ever be.

Sweeter sounds than music knows
Charm me, in Emmanuel’s Name;
All her hopes my spirit owes
To His birth, and cross, and shame.

Christ will me His aid afford,
Never to fall, never to fall,
While I find my precious Lord,
Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

Sweetest joy the soul can know,
Fairest Light was ever shed,
Who alike in joy or woe,
Leavest none unvisited;
Spirit of the Highest God,
Lord from Whom is life bestowed,
Who upholdest everything,
Hear me, hear me, while I sing!

Sweetly the holy hymn
Breaks on the morning air;
Before the world with smoke is dim
We meet to offer prayer.

Swell the anthem, raise the song;
Praises to our God belong.
Saints and angels join to sing
Praises to the heav’nly King.
Blessings from His liberal hand
Flow around this happy land.
Kept by Him, no foes annoy;
Peace and freedom we enjoy.

It was midnight in the valley, and the camp was dark and still,
Where the slumb’ring host of Midian lay along the sloping hill,
When a blinding flash of torches, and a trumpet loud and shrill,
Threw out the battle cry:

The Saint who first found grace to pen
The Life which was the Life of men,
And shed abroad the Gospel’s ray,
His fame we celebrate today.

The saints should never be dismayed,
Nor sink in hopeless fear;
For when they least expect His aid,
The Savior will appear.

The sands of time are sinking, the dawn of 
Heaven breaks;
The summer morn I’ve sighed for—the fair, sweet 
morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight, but dayspring 
is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth in Immanuel’s land.

The Savior 
calls; let 
every ear
Attend the 
heav’nly 
sound.
Ye doubting 
souls, dismiss 
your fear;
Hope smiles 
reviving 
round.

The Saviour 
comes, no 
outward 
pomp,
Bespeaks His 
presence 
nigh;
No earthly 
beauty 
shines in 
Him,
To draw the 
carnal eye.

The Savior 
died, but 
rose again
Triumphant 
from the 
grave;
And pleads 
our cause 
at God’s 
right 
hand,
Omnipotent 
to save.

From 
Heaven 
above, 
in His 
infinite 
love,
Came 
Jesus, a 
Savior 
to be;
And He 
scorned 
the deep 
pain our 
ransom 
to gain,
O He is 
the 
Savior 
for me.

The Savior Who loves me and suffered the loss
Of heavenly glory to die on the cross,
The Babe of the manger, though born without stain,
This Jesus is coming, is coming again!

I must have the Savior with me,
For I dare not go alone,
I must feel His presence near me,
And His arm around me thrown.

The seasons are fixed by wisdom divine,
The slow-changing moon show forth God’s design;
The sun in his circuit his Maker obeys,
And running his journey hastes not nor delays.

The strife is o’er, the battle done;
The victory of life is won;
The song of triumph has begun: Alleluia!

The sun is on the land and sea,
The day begun;
Our morning hymn begins with Thee,
Blest Three in One;
Our praise shall rise continually
Till day is done.

Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;
Unless Thou help me I must die;
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.

Take me as I am, O Savior
Better I can never be;
Thou alone canst bring me nearer
Self but draws me far from Thee.
I can never, I can never, I can never
But within Thy wounds be saved,
But within Thy wounds be saved.

I don’t love You like I used to
When nothing came between my God and me
And somehow it seems
I’ve lessened my dependence
I wonder why it’s not the way it used to be
But I’m ready to learn 
How to faithfully love You
With my heart, my soul, my mind
Take me back, take me back to
The time I fell in love
I don’t serve You like I used to
’Cause I’m too busy serving me 
And I don’t spend the time with You I need to
And wonder why my soul cannot find peace
But I’m ready to learn 
How to faithfully serve You
With my hands, my life, my time
Take me back, take me back to
The time I fell in love

Take me, O my Father, take me;
Take me, save me, through Thy Son;
That which Thou wouldst have me, make me,
Let Thy will in me be done.
Long from Thee my footsteps straying,
Thorny proved the way I trod;
Weary come I now, and praying,
Take me to Thy love, my God.

Take not thought for food or raiment,
Careful one, so anxiously;
For the King Himself provideth
Food and clothes for thee.

You have wandered far on the desert lone,
And you face an awful fate,
For a storm is near and the night comes on—
Take the home-path ere too late.

Take the Name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe,
It will joy and comfort give you;
Take it then, where弾r you go.

Take the world, but give me Jesus,
All its joys are but a name;
But His love abideth ever,
Through eternal years the same.

“Take the world for Jesus," sound the great battle cry,
Let the mighty ring;
 “Take the world for Jesus," raise the bright standard high,
As we shout, as we march, as we sing.

Take Thou our minds, dear Lord, we humbly pray,
Give us the mind of Christ each passing day;
Teach us to know the truth that sets us free;
Grant us in all our thoughts to honor Thee.

Take up the battle cry all along the line;
You shall gain the victory, victory divine,
With your Commander nigh, foes in vain combine;
Raise aloft the banner, let it bear the sign.

I walked one day along a country road,
And there a stranger journeyed, too,
Bent low beneath the burden of His load:
It was a cross, a cross I knew.

“Take up thy cross," the Savior said,
 “If thou wouldst My disciple be;
Deny thyself, the world forsake,
And humbly follow after Me."

Talk with us, Lord, Thyself reveal,
While here o’er earth we rove;
Speak to our hearts, and let us feel
The kindling of Thy love.

Tarry with me, O my Savior,
In my heart and life abide,
Keep me by Thy grace and favor,
Ever near Thy loving side.

()

Inside my heart
I lift up an altar
A fragrance of praise
I come to offer You
Revive my soul and keep me by Your side
The honour and the glory
To You Lord Jesus Christ

Teach me the measure of my days,
Thou Maker of my frame;
I would survey life’s narrow space,
And learn how frail I am.

Teach me Thy way, O Lord, teach me Thy way!
Thy guiding grace afford, teach me Thy way!
Help me to walk aright, more by faith, less 
by sight;
Lead me with heav’nly light, teach me Thy 
way!

Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray;

Teach me, my God and King,
In all things Thee to see,
And what I do in anything
To do it as for Thee.

Teach me, O Lord, Thy way of truth,
And from it I will not depart;
That I may steadfastly obey,
Give me an understanding heart.

Teach me, O Lord, Thy holy way,
And give me an obedient mind;
That in Thy service I may find
My soul’s delight from day to day.

Teach us, O Lord, true brotherhood,
In daily thought and deed,
That we may tread with humble heart,
The path where Thou dost lead.

Tell his praise in song and story,
bless the Lord with heart and voice
in my God is all my glory, 
come before him and rejoice.
Join to praise his name together,
he who hears his people's cry;
tell his praise, come wind or weather,
shining faces lifted high.
To the Lord whose love has found them
cry the poor in their distress;
swift his angels camped around them
prove him sure to save and bless.
God it is who hears our crying
though the spark of faith be dim
taste and see! Beyond denying
blessed are those who trust in him.
Taste and see! In faith draw near him,
trust the Lord with all your powers;
seek and serve him, love and fear him,
life and all its joys are ours -
true delight in holy living,
peace and plenty, length of days;
come, my children, with thanksgiving
bless the Lord in songs of praise.
In our need he walks beside us,
ears alert to every cry;
watchful eyes to guard and guide us,
love that whispers, 'It is I.'
Good shall triumph, wrong be righted,
God has pledged his promised word;
so with ransomed saints united
join to praise our living Lord!

Into the tent where a gypsy boy lay,
Dying alone at the close of the day,
News of salvation we carried; said he:
“Nobody ever has told it to me!"

Tell it out among the heathen that 
the Lord is King;
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the nations, bid 
them shout and sing;
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out with adoration that He 
shall increase,
That the mighty King of Glory is the 
King of Peace;
Tell it out with jubilation, let the 
song ne’er cease;
Tell it out! Tell it out!

Are you happy in the Lord,
Tell it out with gladness;
Are you trusting in His Word,
Tell it out with gladness;
If a Savior’s love you feel,
Can your soul its power conceal?
To the world your joy reveal,
Tell it out with gladness.

Tell it out! Tell it out! tell the 
story sweet,
News from Heav’n repeat, Gospel 
tidings sweet.
Tell it out! Tell it out! Jesus waits 
today,
Waits to hear us when we pray.

Tell it to every kindred and nation,
Tell it far and near;
Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,
Jesus will soon appear.

Are you weary, are you heavy 
hearted?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to 
Jesus.
Are you grieving over joys 
departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

Tell me no more of earthly toys
Of sinful mirth and carnal joys,
The things I loved before;
Let me but see my Savior's face,
And feel His animating grace,
And I desire no more.
Tell me no more of praise and wealth,
Tell me no more of ease and health,
For these have all their snares;
Let me but know my sins forgiv'n,
And see my name enrolled in heav'n,
And I am free from care.
Give me the Bible in my hand,
A heart to read and understand,
And faith to trust the Lord;
I'd sit alone from day to day.
Nor urge my company to stay,
Nor wish to rove abroad.

Tell me the old, old story of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story simply, as to a little child,
For I am weak and weary, and helpless and defiled.

Tell me the stories of Jesus I love to hear;
Things I would ask Him to tell me if He were here;
Scenes by the wayside, tales of the sea,
Stories of Jesus, tell them to me.

Tell me the story of Jesus,
Write on my heart every word.
Tell me the story most precious,
Sweetest that ever was heard.
Tell how the angels in ,
Sang as they welcomed His birth.
 “Glory to God in the highest!
Peace and good tidings to earth."

When I was but a little child how well I recollect
How I would grieve my mother with my folly and neglect;
And now that she has gone to Heav'n I miss her tender care:
O Savior, tell my mother, I'll be there!

Tell of Christ Who saves from sin;
Make Him known—make Him known!
He has called you souls to win,
Make Him known!

Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!
Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;
Tender to me the promise of His Word;
In God my Savior shall my heart rejoice.

Let all the lost hear of Jesus,
Out in the darkness astray,
Go tell the world of the Shepherd,
Carry the news today.

Church of God, awaken; heed the Lord’s command,
Tell the blessed story of the cross.
Fields are white for harvesting on every hand,
Tell the blessed story of the cross.

Tell the blessed tidings, children of the King,
With your glad hosannas make the morning ring:
Songs of His salvation, nevermore should cease;
Crown Him with your praises, hail Him Prince of Peace!
Round His throne of triumph happy hosts attend,
His the power and glory, kingdom without end.

Tell the whole wide world of Jesus,
Bear the news from shore to shore;
Telling sinners of the Savior,
Let the light spread more and more.

Temple of God's Holy Spirit,
not my own, this human frame,
purchased by my Savior's merit
for the glory of his Name--
not my own--
for the glory of his Name.
Temple of God's Holy Spirit,
temple builded for my God,
not for self and flesh to mar it,
spotless keep his fair abode--
not my own--
spotless keep his fair abode.
Savior, give me of thy Spirit,
holiness I crave from thee;
thine own beauty, let me wear it,
clothe me in thy purity--
not my own--
clothe me in thy purity.

Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,
Whose life our ransom paid,
Whose blood a full atonement
For all the world has made.
Let every heart adore Him;
Let every creature sing
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,
Our Savior and our King.

Ten thousand times ten thousand in sparkling raiment 
bright,
The armies of the ransomed saints throng up the steeps 
of light;
 ’Tis finished, all is finished, their fight with death 
and sin;
Fling open wide the golden gates, and let the victors 
in.

Tender love of Jesus, so lovely and so pure;
Flowing thru this vessel to strengthen, fill and 
cure
All the doubt and turmoil that’s caused by sin 
and shame,
Making me a witness to His most holy Name.
Yes, love, Christ’s love, pure love, great love;
With joy my heart is singing, the things of life 
grow dim,
For Christ is love!

Tenderly the Shepherd,
O’er the mountains cold,
Goes to bring the lost one
Back to the fold.

Terrible God, that reign’st on high,
How awful is Thy thund’ring hand!
Thy fiery bolts, how fierce they fly!
Nor can all earth or hell withstand.

Terrible thought! shall I alone—
Who may be saved—Shall I
Of all, alas! whom I have known,
Through sin for ever die?

Thank and Praise Jehovah’s Name;
For His mercies, firm and sure,
From eternity the same
To eternity endure.

Worship, and thanks, and blessing,
And strength ascribe to Jesus!
Jesus alone
Defends his own,
When earth and hell oppress us.
Jesus with joy we witness
Almighty to deliver;
Our seals set to,
That God is true,
And reigns a King for ever.
Omnipotent Redeemer,
Our ransomed souls adore thee:
Our Saviour thou,
We find it now,
And give thee all the glory.
We sing thine arm unshortened,
Brought through our sore temptation;
With heart and voice
In thee rejoice,
The God of our salvation.
Thine arm hath safely brought us
A way no more expected,
Than when thy sheep
Passed through the deep,
By crystal walls protected.
Thy glory was our rearward,
Thine hand our lives did cover,
And we, ev'n we,
Have walked the sea,
And marched triumphant over.
The world, and Satan's malice
Thou, Jesus, hast confounded;
And, by thy grace,
With songs of praise
Our happy souls resounded.
Accepting our deliverance,
We triumph in thy favour,
And for the love
Which now we prove
Shall praise thy name for ever.

Thanks for Thy Word, O blessed Redeemer!
Open our eyes its beauty to see;
Grant us Thy grace to study it wisely,
Close every heart to all but Thee.

Thanks to God for my Redeemer,
Thanks for all Thou dost provide!
Thanks for times now but a memory,
Thanks for Jesus by my side!
Thanks for pleasant, balmy springtime,
Thanks for dark and stormy fall!
Thanks for tears by now forgotten,
Thanks for peace within my soul!

That awful day will surely come,
Th’appointed hour makes haste,
When I must stand before my Judge,
And pass the solemn test.

I know of a name,
A beautiful name,
That angels brought down to earth;
They whispered it low,
One night long ago,
To a maiden of lowly birth.

That cause can never be lost nor 
stayed
Which takes the course of what God 
has made;
And is not trusting in walls and 
towers,
But slowly growing from seeds to 
flowers.

That day of wrath, that dreadful 
day,
 [or, 

That Eastertide with joy was 
bright,
The sun shone out with fairer 
light,
When, to their longing eyes 
restored,
The glad apostles saw their Lord.

That glorious day is coming,
The hour is hastening on;
Its radiant light is nearing,
Far brighter than the sun;
In yonder clouds of heaven
The Savior will appear;
And gather all His chosen,
To meet Him in the air.

That glorious day is drawing 
nigh,
When Zion’s light shall come;
She shall arise and shine on 
high,
Bright as the morning sun;
The north and south their sons 
resign,
And earth’s foundations bend;
Clothed as a bride, Jerusalem
All glorious shall descend.

That great, tremendous day’s 
approaching,
That awful scene is drawing 
nigh,
Which was foretold by 
ancient prophets,
Decreed from all eternity.
Prepare my soul, reflect and 
wonder,
That awful scene in drawing 
near,
When you shall see the great 
transaction,
When Christ in judgment 
shall appear.

That man a godly life 
might live,
God did these Ten 
Commandments give
By His true servant Moses, 
high
Upon the Mount Sinai.
Have mercy, Lord!

That man is blest who 
stands in awe
Of God, and loves His 
sacred law:
His seed on earth shall 
be renowned;
His house the seat of 
wealth shall be,
An inexhausted treasury,
And with successive 
honors crowned.

That man is blest who, 
fearing God
From sin restrains his 
feet,
Who will not stand 
with wicked men,
Who shuns the 
scorners’ seat.

The advent of our God
with eager prayers we greet,
and singing haste upon his road
his glorious gift to meet.
The everlasting Son
scorns not a Virgin's womb;
that we from bondage may be won
he bears a bondsman's doom.
Daughter of Zion, rise
to meet thy lowly King,
let not thy stubborn heart despise
the peace he deigns to bring.
In clouds of awful light,
as judge he comes again,
his scattered people to unite
with them in heaven to reign.
Let evil flee away
ere that dread hour shall dawn,
let this old Adam day by day
God's image still put on.
Praise to the Incarnate Son,
who comes to set us free,
with God the Father, ever One,
to all eternity.

The advent of our King
our prayers must now employ,
and we must hymns of welcome sing
in strains of holy joy.
The everlasting Son
incarnate deigns to be;
himself a servant's form puts on
to set his servants free.
Daughter of Zion, rise
to meet thy lowly King,
nor let thy faithless heart despise
the peace he comes to bring.
As Judge, on clouds of light,
he soon will come again,
and all his scattered saints unite
with him in heaven to reign.
Before the dawning day
let sin's dark deeds be gone;
the old man all be put away,
the new man all put on.
All glory to the Son
who comes to set us free,
with Father, Spirit, ever One,
through all eternity.

Pilot divine, and Lord of all on high
Thine are the starry squadrons of the sky!
Lead us whose wings for freedoms sake now soar,
Into our hearts thy faith and courage pour
Oh hear our prayer.

The angel Gabriel from heaven came,
his wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame;
"All hail," said he, "thou lowly maiden Mary,
most highly favored lady," Gloria!
"For know a blessed Mother thou shalt be,
all generations laud and honor thee,
thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold,
most highly favored lady," Gloria!
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head,
"To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,
"my soul shall laud and magnify his holy Name."
Most highly favored lady, Gloria!
Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born
in Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn,
and Christian folk throughout the world will ever say--
"Most highly favored lady," Gloria!

Angels chant the heav’nly song,
 “Peace on earth, good-will";
Hear the echo loud and long
On the midnight still;
 “Glory, glory," hear them say—
Christ the Lord is born today,
 “Glory be to God in the highest, glory!
Peace on earth, good-will to men."

Hark! the mighty tones sublime,
Trumpet tongues of olden time—
Breathing on the silent air,
Shouting glory everywhere!
Hark! again their joyful sound
Rings afar, the earth around;
While a vast, adoring throng
Catch the strain and join the song.

As the shepherds watched at midnight
On the hills so far away,
Suddenly a light shone ’round them,
Turning midnight into day.
Then each heart was filled with wonder,
For they could not understand
Why the angel host that gathered
Brought to them such music grand.

The angels that watched round the tomb
Where, lo! The Redeemer was laid,
When deep in mortality's gloom,
He his for a season His head;
That veiled their face while He slept,
And ceased their sweet harps to employ,
Have witnessed His rising, and swept,
The chords with the Triumph of Joy.
Dear saints, who once languished below,
But long since have entered your rest;
I pant to be glorified too,
And lean on Immanuel's breast.
The grave in which Jesus was laid,
Has buried my guilt and my fears,
And while I contemplate its shade,
The light of His presence appears.
O, sweet is the season of rest,
When life's weary journey is done,
The blush that spreads over its west
The last ling'ring ray of its sun.
Though dreary the empire of night,
I soon shall emerge from its gloom,
And see immortality's light
Arise on the shades of the tomb.
Then welcome the last rending sighs,
When these aching heart-strings shall break,
When death shall extinguish these eyes
And moisten with dew the pale cheek.
No terror the prospect begets,
I am not mortality's slave,
The sunbeam of life as it sets,
Leaves a halo of peace in the grave.

The apostles' hearts were full of pain
for their dear Lord so lately slain,
by rebel servants doomed to die
a death of cruel agony.
With gentle voice the angel gave
the women tidings at the grave:
"Fear not, your Master shall ye see;
he goes before to Galilee."
Then hastening on their eager way
the joyful tidings to convey,
their Lord they met, their living Lord,
and, falling at his feet, adored.
The eleven, when they hear, with speed
to Galilee forthwith proceed,
that there once more they may behold
the Lord's dear face, as he foretold.
O Lord of all, with us abide
in this our joyful Eastertide;
from every weapon death can wield
thine own redeemed for ever shield.
"To arms, to arms!" King Jesus leads the way;
The Armageddon forces of the Lord of Hosts
Are mobilizing for the mighty fray.

There's a royal banner given for display
To the soldiers of the King;
As an ensign fair we lift it up today,
While as ransomed ones we sing.

In  heavenly armor we'll enter the land,
The  battle belongs to the Lord.
No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand,
The  battle belongs to  the Lord!
We sing glory, honor,
power, and strength to the Lord.
We sing glory, honor,
Power, and strength to the Lord.
When the power of darkness comes in like a flood,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
When your enemy presses in hard do not fear,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
Take courage, my friend, your redemption is near,
The battle belongs to the Lord!

The battle is the Lords! The harvest fields are white
How few the reaping hands appear, their strength how slight!
Yes victory  is sure, we face a vanquished foe
Then forward with the risen Christ to battle go!

We have heard of a land on whose blue, ether skies
Not a cloud for a moment can stay;
And it needs not the sun in his splendor to rise
For the Lord is the light of its day;
We have heard of that land, and its glory we seek,
Where the faithful with Jesus shall dwell,
Where the roses of youth never fade from the cheek,
And the lips never murmur, “Farewell."

The bells of hope are ringing,
O’er all the world today,
And countless voices singing
Join in the happy lay;
The world is full of gladness,
For hope today was born,
When Christ, the King of glory
Arose on Easter morn.

The Bible stands like a rock undaunted
’Mid the raging storms of time;
Its pages burn with the truth eternal,
And they glow with a light sublime.

This blessed night we seek Your throne
In awe and wonder at that birth:
The Child of Bethlehem who brought
God’s grace and love back down to earth.

The blood that Jesus once shed for me,
As my Redeemer, upon the tree;
The blood that setteth the prisoner free,
Will never lose its power.
It will never lose its power,
It will never lose its power;
The blood that cleanses from all sin
Will never lose its power.
It gives us access to God on high,
From “far off places" it brings us nigh;
To precious blessings that never die,
It will never lose its power.
It is a shelter for rich and poor,
It is to Heaven the open door;
The sinner’s merit forevermore,
It will never lose its power.
And when with all the blood washed throng
We sing in glory redemption’s song;
We’ll pass the glorious truth along,
It has never lost its power.

The blood that Jesus shed for me
Way back on Calvary
The blood that gives me strength
From day to day
It will never lose its power.

O tell me, gentle shepherd,
Gentle shepherd, gentle shepherd,
O tell me what the angels sang
In the early Christ-mas morn.
O tell me what the angels sang
In the early Christ-mas morn.
O tell me, gentle shepherd,
Gentle shepherd, gentle shepherd,
What the great bright host of angels sang,
All out in the fields so still.
What the great bright host of angels sang,
All out in the fields so still.
I will tell you, Christian children,
Christian children, Christian children,
What the great bright host of angels sang,
All out in the fields so still:
 "Glory in the highest, glory!
Peace on earth, to all goodwill!" 

When Jesus was asked by His servants one day
Who greatest in Heaven would be,
He beckoned a little one to Him and said,
 “Such only shall enter with Me."

The Church has waited long,  Her absent Lord to see,And still in 
loneliness she waits,  A friendless stranger she.  Age after age has 
gone,  Sun after sun has set,And still in weeds of widowhood,
  She weeps a mourner yet.

There’s a dear little church in the village,
Near the spot where I first saw the day;
Where in childhood I learned of the Savior,
As the Life, and the Truth, and the Way.

There's a church in the valley by the wildwood
'Tis the loveliest place in the dale;
Not a spot is so dear to my childhood,
As the little brown church in the vale.

The church of Christ in every age,
beset by change but Spirit-led,
must claim and test its heritage
and keep on rising from the dead.
Across the world, across the street,
the victims of injustice cry
for shelter and for bread to eat,
and never live until they die.
The let the servant church arise,
a caring church that longs to be
a partner in Christ's sacrifice,
and clothed in Christ's humanity.
For he alone, whose blood was shed,
can cure the fever in our blood,
and teach us how to share our bread
and feed the starving multitude.
We have no mission but to serve
in full obedience to our Lord:
to care for all, without reserve,
and spread his liberating word.

The Church of God a kingdom is,
where Christ in power doth reign,
where spirits yearn till seen in bliss
their Lord shall come again.
Glad companies of saints possess
this Church below, above;
and God's perpetual calm doth bless
their paradise of love.
An altar stands within the shrine
whereon, once sacrificed,
is set, immaculate, divine,
the Lamb of God, the Christ.
There rich and poor, from countless lands,
praise Christ on mystic rood;
there nations reach forth holy hands
to take God's holy food.
There pure life-giving streams o'erflow
the sower's garden ground;
and faith and hope fair blossoms show,
and fruits of love abound.
O King, O Christ, this endless grace
to us and all men bring,
to see the vision of thy face
in joy, O Christ, our King.

The Church of God is stablished
Through Jesus Christ our Lord,
Indwelt by Christ all glorious
With Christ she shall accord.
The sweetness of Christ’s spirit
Within her life endures,
And to the weary nations
God’s day of peace ensures.

The Church's one foundation
is Jesus Christ her Lord;
she is his new creation,
by water and the word:
from heaven he came and sought her
to be his holy bride;
with his own blood he bought her, 
and for her life he died.
Elect from every nation,
yet one o'er all the earth,
her charter of salvation,
one Lord, one faith, one birth;
one holy Name she blesses,
partakes one holy food,
and to one hope she presses,
with every grace endued.
Though with a scornful wonder
men see her sore oppressed,
by schisms rent asunder,
by heresies distressed;
yet saints their watch are keeping,
their cry goes up, "How long?"
and soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song.
Mid toil and tribulation,
and tumult of her war
she waits the consummation
of peace for evermore;
till with the vision glorious
her longing eyes are blessed,
and the great Church victorious 
shall be the Church at rest.
Yet she on earth hath union
with God, the Three in one,
and mystic sweet communion
with those whose rest is won.
O happy ones and holy! 
Lord, give us grace that we
like them, the meek and lowly,
on high may dwell with thee.

In the crimson of the morning,
In the whiteness of the noon,
In the amber glory of the day’s retreat;
In the midnight robed in darkness,
Or the gleaming of the moon,
I listen for the coming of His feet.

Lo, the conflict of the ages is upon us today,
And the armies are assembling all in battle array;
Are you numbered with the faithful, one of God’s loyal few,
Who have sworn Him full allegiance? can He count upon you?

O Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Thy triumphant day is come!
Day of glorious victory,
Over the boasting tomb!
All the shame and agony
Of the cruel cross He bore;
Died the Man of Galilee,
But rose the Conqueror!

On Calvary’s distant mountain
The cross of faith I see,
Where once the Lord of glory
Was crucified for me.

The cross that He gave may be heavy,  But it ne'er outweighs His grace;The storm that I feared may surround me,  But it ne'er excludes His face.

Our Lord is now rejected,
And by the world disowned;
By the many still neglected,
And by the few enthroned.
But soon He'll come in glory;
The hour is drawing nigh
For the crowning-day that's coming
  by-and-by!

The dawn is sprinkling in the east
its golden shower, as day flows in;
fast mount the pointed shafts of light:
farewell to darkness and to sin!
Away, ye midnight phantoms all!
Away, despondence and despair!
Whatever guilt the night has brought
now let it vanish into air.
So, Lord, when that last morning breaks,
looking to which we sigh and pray,
O may it to thy minstrels prove
the dawning of a better day.
To God the Father glory be,
and to his sole begotten Son;
glory, O Holy Ghost, to thee
while everlasting ages run.

The day draws on with golden light,
glad songs go echoing through the height,
the broad earth lifts an answering cheer,
the deep makes moan with wailing fear.
For lo, he comes, the mighty King,
to take from death his power and sting,
to trample down his gloomy reign
and break the weary prisoner's chain.
Enclosed he lay in rocky cell,
with guard of armed sentinel;
but thence returning, strong and free,
he comes with pomp of jubilee.
The sad apostles mourn him slain,
nor hope to see their Lord again;
their Lord, whom rebel thralls defy,
arraign, accuse and doom to die.
But now they put their grief away,
the pains of hell are loosed today;
for by the grave, with flashing eyes,
"Your Lord is risen," the Angel cries.
Make of all, to thee we pray,
fulfill in us thy joy today;
when death assaults, grant, Lord, that we
may share thy paschal mystery.
To thee, who, dead, again dost live,
all glory, Lord, thy people give;
all glory, as is ever meet,
to Father and to Paraclete.

He brought me love
That only He could give 
I brought Him cause to cry
And though He taught me how to live
I only sat and watched Him die
He could’ve called His Holy Father 
And said “Take Me away, 
Please take Me away!"
He could’ve said: “O I’m not guilty
And I’m not gonna stay
I’m not gonna pay" 
But He walked right through the gate
Then on up the hill
And as He fell beneath the way
He cried, He cried:‘Father not my will’

The day is gently sinking to a close,
Fainter and yet more faint the sunlight glows:
O Brightness of Thy Father's glory, Thou
eternal Light of light, be with us now:
Where Thou art present darkness cannot be;
Midnight is glorious noon, O Lord, with Thee.

The day is past and over;
all thanks, O Lord, to thee!
I pray thee now that sinless
the hours of dark may be.
O Jesus, keep me in thy sight,
and guard me through the coming night.
The joys of day are over;
I lift my heart to thee,
and ask thee that offenseless
the hours of dark may be.
O Jesus, keep me in thy sight,
and guard me through the coming night.
The toils of day are over;
I raise the hymn to thee,
and ask that free from peril
the hours of dark may be.
O Jesus, keep me in thy sight,
and guard me through the coming night.
Be thou my soul's preserver,
for thou alone dost know
how many are the perils
through which I have to go.
O loving Jesus, hear my call,
and guard and save me from them all.

The day is surely drawing near
When God's Son, the Anointed,
Shall with great majesty appear
As Judge of all appointed.
All mirth and laughter then shall cease
When flames on flames will still increase,
As Scripture truly teacheth.

The day of resurrection! 
Earth, tell it out abroad;
the Passover of gladness, 
the Passover of God.
From death to life eternal, 
from earth unto the sky,
our Christ hath brought us over, 
with hymns of victory.
Our hearts be pure from evil, 
that we may see aright
the Lord in rays eternal 
of resurrection light;
and listening to his accents, 
may hear so calm and plain 
his own "All hail!" and, hearing, 
may raise the victor strain.
Now let the heavens be joyful! 
Let earth her song begin!
The round world keep high triumph, 
and all that is therein!
Let all things seen and unseen 
their notes in gladness blend,
for Christ the Lord hath risen, 
our joy that hath no end.

The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended,
the darkness falls at thy behest;
to thee our morning hymns ascended,
thy praise shall sanctify our rest.
We thank thee that thy Church, unsleeping
while earth rolls onward into light,
through all the world her watch is keeping
and rests not now by day nor night.
As o'er each continent and island
the dawn leads on another day,
the voice of prayer is never silent,
nor dies the strain of praise away.
The sun that bids us rest is waking
our brethren 'neath the western sky,
and hour by hour fresh lips are making
thy wondrous doings heard on high.
So be it, Lord; thy throne shall never,
like earth's proud empires, pass away;
thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,
till all thy creatures own thy sway.

The death of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
We celebrate with one accord;
It is our comfort in distress,
Our heart's sweet joy and happiness.

The duteous day now closeth,
each flower and tree reposeth,
shade creeps o'er wild and wood:
let us, as night is falling,
on God our Maker calling,
give thanks to him, the Giver good.
Now all the heavenly splendor
breaks forth in starlight tender
from myriad worlds unknown;
and man, this marvel seeing,
forget his selfish being
for joy of beauty not his own.
His care he drowneth yonder,
lost in the abyss of wonder;
to heaven his soul doth steal:
this life he disesteemeth,
the day it is that dreameth,
that doth from truth his vision seal.
Awhile his mortal blindness
may miss God's lovingkindness
and grope in faithless strife;
but when life's day is over,
shall death's fair night discover
the fields of everlasting life.

The dying robber raised his aching brow
to claim the dying Lord for company;
and heard in answer to his trembling vow,
the promise of the King: thou--even thou--
today shalt be in paradise with me.
We too the measure of our guilt confess,
knowing thy mercy, Lord, our only plea;
that we, like him, through judgment and distress,
for all the weight of our unworthiness,
may win our way to paradise with thee.
But so bewildered is our failing heart,
so dim the luster of thy royalty,
we hardly know thee, Lord, for what thou art,
till we begin to take the better part
and lose ourselves in paradise with thee.
Then lift our eyes, dear Lord, from this poor dross,
to see thee reigning in humility,
the King of love; that, wresting gain from loss,
we too may climb the ladder of the cross,
to find our home in paradise with thee.

The earth for ever is the Lord’s,
With Adam’s numerous race;
He raised its arches o’er the floods,
And built it on the seas.

The earth with all her fullness owns
Jehovah for her sovereign Lord;
The countless myriads of her sons
Rose into being at His Word.

The earth with all her fullness owns
Jehovah for her sovereign Lord;
The countless myriads of her sons
Rose into being at His Word.

The earth, O Lord, is one wide field
of all thy chosen seed;
the crop prepared its fruit to yield;
the laborers few indeed.
We therefore come before thee now
by fasting and by prayer,
beseeching of thy love that thou
wouldst send more laborers there.
Not for our land alone we pray,
though that above the rest;
the realms and islands far away,
O let them all be blessed.
Endue the bishops of thy flock
with wisdom and with grace,
against false doctrine, like a rock,
to set the heart and face.
To all thy priests thy truth reveal,
and make thy judgments clear;
make thou thy deacons full of zeal
and humble and sincere.
And give their flocks a lowly mind
to hear and not in vain,
that each and all may mercy find
when thou shalt come again.

The eternal gates lift up their heads,
the doors are opened wide,
the King of glory is gone up
unto his Father's side.
And ever on our earthly path
a gleam of glory lies,
a light still breaks behind the cloud
that veils thee from the eyes.
Lift up our hearts, lift up our minds,
and let thy grace be given,
that, while we live on earth below,
our treasure be in heaven;
That, where thou art at God's right hand,
our hope, our love may be:
dwell in us now, that we may dwell
for evermore in thee.

The eternal gifts of Christ the King,
the apostles' glory, let us sing,
and all, with hearts of gladness, raise 
due hymns of thankful love and praise.
For they the Church's princes are,
triumphant leaders in the war,
in heavenly courts a warrior band,
true lights to lighten every land.
Theirs is the steadfast faith of saints,
and hope that never yields nor faints;
and love of Christ in perfect glow
that lays the prince of this world low.
In them the Father's glory shone,
in them the will of God the Son,
in them exults the Holy Ghost,
through them rejoice the heavenly host.
To thee, Redeemer, now we cry,
that thou wouldst join to them on high
thy servants, who this grace implore,
for ever and for evermore.

Come, O my soul, my ev’ry pow’r awaking,
Look unto Him Whose goodness crowns thy days;
While into song angelic choirs are breaking,
O let thy voice its thankful tribute bring.

The Family who prays
Will never be parted
Their circle in heaven unbroken shall stand
God will say "enter, my good faithful servants"
The family who prays
Never shall part

The fast, as taught by holy lore,
we keep in solemn course once more;
the fast to all men known, and bound
in forty days of yearly round.
The law and seers that were of old
in diverse ways this Lent foretold,
which Christ, all seasons' King and Guide,
in after ages sanctified.
More sparing therefore let us make
the words we speak, the food we take,
our sleep and mirth,-- and closer barred
be every sense in holy guard.
In prayer together let us fall,
and cry for mercy, one and all,
and weep before the Judge's feet,
and his avenging wrath entreat.
Thy grace have we offended sore,
by sins, O God, which we deplore;
but pour upon us from on high,
O pardoning One, thy clemency.
Remember thou, though frail we be,
that yet thine handiwork are we;
nor let the honor of thy name
be by another put to shame.
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;
increase the good that we have sought;
that we at length, our wanderings o'er,
may please thee here and evermore.
We pray thee, Holy Trinity,
One God, unchanging Unity, 
that we from this our abstinence
may reap the fruits of penitence.

The fathers built this city
In ages long ago,
And busy in the busy streets,
They hurried to and fro;
The children played around them,
And sang the songs of yore,
Till one by one they fell asleep,
To work and play no more.

Beautiful song of Christmas!
Sung in the long ago,
Bringing the joy of Heaven,
Down to the earth below.
Story of deepest meaning,
Burst forth in music sweet,
While from afar the wise men
Gathered at Jesus’ feet.

The first Nowell the angel did say
was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
in fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,
on a cold winter's night that was so deep.

I'm [

The God of Abraham praise,
who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days,
and God of love;
Jehovah, great I AM,
by earth and heaven confessed:
I bow and bless the sacred Name
for ever blessed.
The God of Abraham praise,
at whose supreme command
from earth we rise, and seek the joys
at his right hand;
we all on earth forsake, 
its wisdom, fame and power;
and him our only portion make,
our Shield and Tower.
The goodly land we see,
with peace and plenty blessed:
a land of sacred liberty
and endless rest;
there milk and honey flow,
and oil and wine abound,
and trees of life for ever grow,
with mercy crowned.
There dwells the Lord, our King,
the Lord, our Righteousness,
triumphant o'er the world and sin,
the Prince of Peace;
on Zion's sacred height
his kingdom he maintains,
and, glorious with his saints in light,
for ever reigns.
The God who reigns on high, 
the great archangels sing,
and "Holy, holy, holy," cry,
"Almighty King!"
Who was and is the same,
and evermore shall be:
Jehovah, Father, great I AM,
we worship thee."
The whole triumphant host 
give thanks to God on high;
"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"
they ever cry;
hail, Abraham's God and mine;
I join the heavenly lays;
all might and majesty are thine,
and endless praise!

The God of love my Shepherd is,
and he that doth me feed;
while he is mine and I am his,
what can I want or need?
He leads me to the tender grass,
where I both feed and rest;
then to the streams that gently pass,
in both I have the best.
Or if I stray, he doth convert,
and bring my mind in frame,
and all this not for my desert,
but for his holy Name.
Yea, in death's shady black abode
well may I walk, not fear;
for thou art with me, and thy rod
to guide, thy staff to bear.
Surely thy sweet and wondrous love
shall measure all my days;
and as it never shall remove
so neither shall my praise.

The God whom earth and sea and sky
adore and laud and magnify,
whose might they own, whose praise they swell,
in Mary's womb vouchsafed to dwell.
The Lord whom sun and moon obey,
whom all things serve from day to day,
was by the Holy Ghost conceived
of her who through his grace believed.
How blessed that Mother, in whose shrine
the world's Creator, Lord divine,
whose hand contains the earth and sky,
once deigned, as in his ark, to lie.
Blessed in the message Gabriel brought,
blessed by the work the Spirit wrought;
from whom the great Desire of earth
took human flesh and human birth.
O Lord, the Virgin-born, to thee
eternal praise and glory be,
whom with the Father we adore
and Holy Ghost for evermore.

The golden gates are lifted up,
the doors are opened wide,
the King of glory is gone up
unto his Father's side.
And ever on our earthly path
a gleam of glory lies,
a light still breaks behind the cloud
that veils thee from our eyes.
Lift up our hearts, lift up our minds,
and let thy grace be given,
that, while we linger yet below,
our treasure be in heaven.
That, where thou art at God's right hand,
our hope, our love may be;
dwell in us now, that we may dwell
for evermore in thee.

The Gospel bells are ringing,
Over land, from sea to sea:
Blessed news of free salvation
Do they offer you and me.
 “For God so loved the world
That His only Son He gave;
Whosoe’er believeth in Him
Everlasting life shall have."

The Gospel shows the Father's grace,
Who sent His Son to save our race,
Proclaims how Jesus lived and died
That man might thus be justified.

I love to sing the Gospel
Of Jesus Christ my Lord,
The gospel of his coming,
The gospel of his word.

The grace of life is theirs
who on this wedding day
delight to make their vows
and for each other pray.
May they, O Lord, together prove
the lasting joy of Christian love.
Where love is, God abides:
and God shall surely bless
a home where trust and care
give birth to happiness.
May they, O lord, together prove
the lasting joy of such a love.
How slow to take offence
love is! How quick to heal!
How ready in distress
to know how others feel!
May they, O Lord, together prove
the lasting joy of such a love.
And when time lays its hand
on all we hold most dear,
and life, by life consumed,
fulfills its purpose here:
May we, O Lord, together prove
the lasting joy of Christian love.

Since I'm in Christ and pardoned from sin,
O what a world is this I'm now in!
All things are changed by power divine,
For I love Christ and know He is mine.

The great forerunner of the morn,
the herald of the Word, is born;
and faithful hearts shall never fail
with thanks and praise his light to hail.
With heavenly message Gabriel came,
that John should be the herald's name,
and with prophetic utterance told
his actions great and manifold.
John, still unborn, yet gave aright
his witness to the coming light;
and Christ, the Sun of all the earth,
fulfilled that witness at his birth.
Of woman born shall never be
a greater prophet than was he,
whose mighty deeds exalt his fame
to greater than a prophet's name.
All praise to God the Father be,
all praise, eternal Son, to thee,
whom with the Spirit we adore
for ever and for evermore.

The great God of heaven is come down to earth,
his mother a Virgin and sinless his birth;
the Father eternal his Father alone:
he sleeps in a manger; he reigns on the throne:

Oh, when shall sickness and disease
Their persecuting warfare cease;
And weakness die, and grief and pain,
And death itself at last be slain?

The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus;
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.

There’s an hour which no man knoweth,
Nor the angels round the throne,
When the Lord shall come in glory from the sky;
All the saints shall rise to meet Him,
For He calleth for his own;
They shall hear the trumpet sounding by and by.

The head that once was crowned with thorns
is crowned with glory now;
a royal diadem adorns
the mighty Victor's brow.
The highest place that heaven affords
is his, is his by right,
the King of kings, and Lord of lords,
and heaven's eternal Light;
The joy all of all who dwell above,
the joy of all below,
to whom he manifests his love
and grants his Name to know.
To them the cross with all its shame,
with all its grace is given;
their name, an everlasting name;
their joy, the joy of heaven.
They suffer with their Lord below,
they reign with him above,
their profit and their joy to know
the mystery of his love.
The cross he bore is life and health,
though shame and death to him:
his people's hope, his people's wealth,
their everlasting theme.

The heavenly Child in stature grows,
and, growing, learns to die;
and still his early training shows
his coming agony.
The Son of God his glory hides
with parents mean and poor;
and he, who made the heavens, abides
in dwelling-place obscure.
Those mighty hands that rule the sky
no earthly toil refuse;
the Maker of the stars on high
a humble trade pursues.
He, whom the choirs of angels praise,
bearing each dread decree,
his earthly parents now obeys
in deep humility.
For this thy lowliness revealed,
Jesus, we thee adore;
and praise to God the Father yield
and Spirit evermore.

The heavenly Word proceeding forth,
yet leaving not the Father's side,
accomplishing his work on earth
and reached at length life's eventide.
By false disciple to be given
to foemen for his life athirst,
himself, the very Bread from heaven,
he gave to his disciples first.
He gave himself in either kind,
his precious Flesh, his precious Blood:
in love's own fullness thus designed
of the whole man to be the Food.
By birth our fellow man was he,
our Food, when sitting at the board;
he died, our ransomer to be;
he ever reigns, our great reward.
O saving Victim, opening wide
the gate of heaven to man below:
our foes press on from every side;
thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.
All praise and thanks to thee ascend 
for evermore, blest One in three;
O grant us life that shall not end
in our true native land with thee.

The heavens declare thy glory, Lord,
in every star thy wisdom shines
but when our eyes behold thy Word,
we read thy Name in fairer lines.
Sun, moon, and stars convey thy praise
round the whole earth, and never stand:
so when thy truth begun its race,
it touched and glanced on every land.
Nor shall thy spreading Gospel rest
till through the world thy truth has run,
till Christ has all the nations blest
that see the light or feel the sun.
Great Sun of Righteousness, arise,
bless the dark world with heavenly light;
thy Gospel makes the simple wise,
thy laws are pure, thy judgments right.
Thy noblest wonders here we view
in souls renewed and sins forgiven;
Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew,
and make thy word my guide to heaven.

The highest and the holiest place
guards not the heart from sin;
the Church that safest seems without
may harbor foes within.
Thus in the small and chosen band,
beloved above the rest,
one fell from his apostleship,
a traitor-soul unblest.
But not the great designs of God
man's sins shall overthrow;
another witness to the truth
forth to the lands shall go.
The soul that sinneth, it shall die;
thy purpose shall not fail;
the word of grace no less shall sound,
the truth no less prevail.
Righteous, O Lord, are all thy ways;
long as the worlds endure,
from foes without and foes within
thy Church shall stand secure.

Last night I lay asleeping,
There came a dream so fair;
I stood in old Jerusalem
Beside the temple there.
I heard the children singing,
And ever as they sang,
Me thought the voice of angels
From heav'n in answer rang;
Me thought the voice of angels
From heav'n in answer rang.

O Holy Mary, blessed by God;
Among all women chosen
To bear the one begotten son
God sent as He had spoken.

Lay hold on the hope set before you,
And let not a moment be lost,
The Savior has purchased your ransom,
But think what a price it hath cost!

Glory to God for the joy to meet
Here at the hour of prayer;
Welcome the bliss of communion sweet
Here at the hour of prayer!

The hymn for conquering martyrs raise,
the victor innocents we praise,
whom in their woe earth cast away,
but heaven with joy received today;
whose angels see the Father's face
world without end, and hymn his grace;
and while they chant unceasing lays,
the hymn for conquering martyrs raise.
A voice from Ramah was there sent,
a voice of weeping and lament,
when Rachel mourned the children's care
whom for the tyrant's sword she bare.
triumphal is their glory now,
whom earthly torments could not bow,
what time, both far and near that went,
a voice from Ramah there was sent.
Fear not, O little flock and blest,
the lion that your life oppressed!
To heavenly pastures ever new
the heavenly Shepherd leadeth you;
who, dwelling now on Zion's hill,
the Lamb's dear footsteps follow still;
by tyrant there no more distressed,
fear not, O little flock and blest.
And every tear is wiped away
by your dear Father's hands for ay;
death hath no power to hurt you more,
whose own is life's eternal store.
who sow their seed, and sowing weep,
in everlasting joy shall reap,
what time they shine in heavenly day,
and every tear is wiped away.
O city blest o'er all the earth,
who gloriest in the Savior's birth,
whose are his earliest martyrs dear,
by kindred and by triumph here;
none from henceforth may call thee small,
of rival towns thou passest all:
in whom our Monarch had his birth,
O city blest o'er all the earth!

There they stand hand in hand 

The joy of the Lord is my strength

Behold! a royal army,
With banner, sword and shield,
Are marching forth to conquer,
On life’s great battlefield;
Its ranks are filled with soldiers,
United, bold and strong,
Who followed their Commander,
And sing their joyful song.

The King of love my shepherd is,
whose goodness faileth never;
I nothing lack if I am his,
and he is mine for ever.
Where streams of living water flow, 
my ransomed soul he leadeth,
and where the verdant pastures grow,
with food celestial feedeth.
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
but yet in love He sought me,
and on his shoulder gently laid,
and home, rejoicing, brought me.
In death's dark vale I fear no ill
with thee, dear Lord, beside me;
thy rod and staff my comfort still,
thy cross before to guide me.
Thou spread'st a table in my sight;
thy unction grace bestoweth;
and O what transport of delight
from thy pure chalice floweth!
And so through all the length of days
thy goodness faileth never: 
Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise
within thy house for ever.

Come, gather, all tribes and all nations,
To worship Jehovah our King;
O, enter His presence with gladness,
Your tribute of gratitude bring.

The Lamb's high banquet called to share,
arrayed in garments white and fair,
the Red Sea past, we now would sing
to Jesus our triumphant King.
Upon the altar of the cross
his Body hath redeemed our loss;
and, tasting of his precious Blood,
our life is hid with him in God.
Protected in the paschal night
from the destroying angel's might,
in triumph went the ransomed free
from Pharoah's cruel tyranny.
Now Christ our Passover is slain,
the Lamb of God without a stain;
his flesh, the true unleavened bread,
is freely offered in our stead.
O all-sufficient Sacrifice,
beneath thee hell defeated lies;
thy captive people are set free,
and endless life restored in thee.
We hymn thee rising from the grave,
from death returning, strong to save;
thine own right hand the tyrant chains,
and paradise for man regains.
All praise is thine, O risen Lord,
from death to endless life restored;
all praise to God the Father be
and Holy Ghost eternally.

The Lamb's high banquet we await
in snow-white robes of royal state;
and now, the Red Sea's channel passed,
to Christ, our Prince, we sing at last.
Upon the altar of the cross
his Body hath redeemed our loss;
and tasting of his roseate Blood,
our life is hid with him in God.
That paschal eve God's arm was bared;
the devastating angel spared:
by strength of hand our hosts went free
from Pharoah's ruthless tyranny.
Now Christ our Passover is slain,
the Lamb of God that knows no stain;
the true oblation offered here,
our own unleavened Bread sincere.
O thou from whom hell's monarch flies,
O great, O very Sacrifice,
thy captive people are set free,
and endless life restored in thee.
For Christ, arising from the dead,
from conquered hell victorious sped;
he thrusts the tyrant down to chains,
and paradise for man regains.
Maker of all, to thee we pray,
fulfill in us thy joy today;
when death assails, grant, Lord, that we
may share thy paschal victory.
To thee who, dead, again dost live,
all glory, Lord, thy people give;
all glory, as is every meet,
to Father and to Paraclete.

The Law commands and makes us know
What duties to our God we owe;
But 'tis the Gospel must reveal
Where lies our strength to do his will.

They are more precious
Than much pure gold
They are sweeter, than honey
From the comb
The precepts of the Lord are right
Giving joy to the heart
The commands of the Lord are radiant 
Giving light to the eye
The fear of the Lord is pure
Enduring forever
The ordinances of the Lord are sure
And altogether righteous 

The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin,
The Light of the world is Jesus!
Like sunshine at noonday, His glory shone in.
The Light of the world is Jesus!

Within a manger peaceful lies
The little Christ asleep
While o'er him Mother Mary bends,
Her faithful watch to keep.

The Lord and King of all things
but yesterday was born;
and Stephen's glorious offering
his birth-tide shall adorn:
no pearls of orient splendor,
no jewels can he show;
but with his own true heart's blood
his shining vestments glow.
Come, ye that love the martyrs,
and pluck the flowers of song,
and weave them in a garland,
for this our suppliant throng;
and cry, "O thou that shinest
in grace's brightest ray,
Christ's valiant protomartyr,
for peace and favor pray!"
Thou first of all confessors,
of all the deacons crown,
of every following athlete,
the glory and renown:
make supplication, standing
before Christ's royal throne,
that he would give the kingdom,
and for our sins atone!

The Lord ascendeth up on high,
the Lord hath triumphed gloriously,
in power and might excelling;
the grave and hell are captive led,
lo! he returns, our glorious Head,
to his eternal dwelling.
The heavens with joy receive their Lord,
by saints, by angel hosts adored,
O day of exultation!
O earth, adore thy glorious King!
His rising, his ascension sing
with grateful adoration!
Our great high Priest hath gone before,
now on his Church his grace to pour,
and still his love he giveth;
O may our hearts to him ascend;
may all within us upward tend
to him who ever liveth!

The Lord be with us as we bend
his blessing to receive;
his gift of peace upon us send,
before his courts to leave.
The Lord be with us as we walk
along our homeward road;
in silent thought or friendly talk
our hearts be near to God.
The Lord be with us till the night
shall close the day of rest;
be he of every heart the Light,
of every home the Guest.
And when our nightly prayers we say,
his watch he still shall keep,
crown with his grace his own blest day,
and guard his people's sleep.

The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth,
The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth;
O let ev'ry tongue and tribe
To him majesty ascribe,
And glorify His matchless name.
The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth,
The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth;
To Him every knee shall bend,
And His reign shall never end,
For the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.

The Lord is come! On Syrian soil,
the child of poverty and toil;
the Man of Sorrows, born to know
each varying shade of human woe:
his joy, his glory, to fulfill,
in earth and heaven, his Father's will;
on lonely mount, by festive board,
on bitter cross, despised, adored.
The Lord is come! In him we trace
the fullness of God's truth and grace;
throughout those words and acts divine
gleams of the eternal splendor shine;
and from his inmost Spirit flow,
as from a height of sunlit snow,
the rivers of perennial life,
to heal and sweeten nature's strife.
The Lord is come! In every heart
where truth and mercy claim apart;
in every land where right is might,
and deeds of darkness shun the light;
in every church where faith and love
lift earthward thoughts to things above;
in every holy, happy home,
we bless thee, Lord, that thou hast come.

The Lord is compassionate and gracious
Slow to anger and abounding in love
He will not always strive with us
Nor will He keep His anger forever
For as high (as high) as the heavens
Are above (above) the earth
So great (so great) is His lovingkindness
Toward those who fear Him ()
As far (as far) as the east
Is from (is from) the west
So far (so far) has He removed
Our transgressions from us ()
Just as (just as) a father
Has compassion for his child
So the Lord (the Lord) has compassion
On those who fear Him ()

The Lord is in His holy place,
Let all the earth be still;
Be still and know that He is God,
And wait to do His will.
We need a sacred watchfulness,
An earnest deep desire for grace,
Our lives with true content to fill.

The Lord is King! lift up thy voice,
O earth; and all ye heavens, rejoice!
From world to world the joy shall ring,
The Lord omnipotent is King.
The Lord is King! who then shall dare
resist his will, distrust his care,
or murmur at his wise decrees,
or doubt his royal promises?
The Lord is King! Child of the dust,
the Judge of the all the earth is just;
holy and true are all his ways;
let every creature speak his praise.
He reigns! ye saints, exalt your strains;
your God is King, your Father reigns;
and he is at the Father's side,
the Man of love, the Crucified.
Come, make your wants, your burdens known;
he will present them at the throne;
and angel bands are waiting there
his messages of love to bear.
The Lord is King! lift up thy voice,
O earth; and all ye heavens, rejoice!
From world to world the joy shall ring,
The Lord omnipotent is King.


The Lord is risen indeed!
Now is his work performed;
now is the mighty captive freed,
and death's strong castle stormed.
The Lord is risen indeed!
Then hell has lost his prey;
with him is risen the ransomed seed
to reign in endless day.
The Lord is risen indeed!
He lives, to die no more;
he lives, the sinner's cause to plead,
whose curse and shame he bore.
The Lord is risen indeed!
Attending angels, hear!
Up to the courts of heaven with speed
the joyful tidings bear.
Then take your golden lyres,
and strike each cheerful chord;
join, all ye bright celestial choirs,
to sing our risen Lord.

The Lord Jehovah reigns;
His throne is built on high;
The garments he assumes
Are light and majesty:
His glories shine with beams so bright,
No mortal eye can bear the sight.
The thunders of his hand
Keep the wide world in awe;
His wrath and justice stand
To guard his holy law;
And where his love resolves to bless,
His truth confirms and seals the grace.
Through all his mighty works
Amazing wisdom shines,
Confounds the powers of hell,
And breaks their dark designs;
Strong is his arm, and shall fulfil
His great decrees and sovereign will.
And will this sovereign King
Of Glory condescend?
And will he write his name
My Father and my Friend?
I love his name, I love his word -
Join all my powers to praise the Lord.

The Lord made man, the scriptures tell,
to bear his image and his sign;
yet we by nature share as well
the ancient mark of Adam's line.
In Adam's fall falls every man,
with every gift the Father gave;
the crown of all creation's plan
becomes a rebel and a slave.
Herein all woes are brought to birth,
all aching hearts and sunless skies;
brightness is gone from all the earth,
the innocence of nature dies.
Yet Adam's children, born to pain,
by self enslaved, by sin enticed,
still may by grace be born again,
children of God, beloved in Christ.
In Christ is Adam's ransom met,
earth, by his cross, is holy ground;
Eden indeed is with us yet--
in Christ are life and freedom found!

The Lord my pasture shall prepare
and feed me with a shepherd's care;
his presence shall my wants supply
and guard me with a watchful eye;
my noonday walks he shall attend
and all my midnight hours defend.
When in the sultry glebe I faint
or on the thirsty mountain pant,
to fertile vales and dewy meads
my weary, wandering steps he leads,
where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
amid the verdant landscape flow.
Though in a bare and rugged way,
through devious lonely wilds, I stray,
thy bounty shall my pains beguile;
the barren wilderness shall smile,
with sudden greens and herbage crowned,
and streams shall murmur all around.
Though in the paths of death I tread,
with gloomy horrors overspread,
my steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
for thou, O Lord, art with me still;
thy friendly crook shall give me aid
and guide me through the dreadful shade.

The Lord my Shepherd is,
I shall be well supplied;
Since He is mine and I am His,
What can I want beside?

The Lord, the Sovereign, sends his summons forth,
Calls the south nations and awakes the north;
From east to west the sounding orders spread,
Through distant worlds and regions of the dead:
No more shall atheists mock his long delay;
His vengeance sleeps no more: behold the day! 
Behold, the Judge descends, his guards are nigh;
Tempest and fire attend him down the sky:
Heav'n, earth, and hell, draw near; let all things come
To hear his justice, and the sinner's doom:
"But gather first my saints," the Judge commands,
"Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands.
Behold, my cov'nant stands for ever good,
Sealed by th' eternal Sacrifice in blood,
And signed with all their names; the Greek, the Jew,
That paid the ancient worship or the new,
There's no distinction here; come, spread their thrones,
And near me seat my fav'rites and my sons.
I, their Almighty Savior and their God,
I am their Judge: ye heav'ns, proclaim abroad
My just eternal sentence, and declare
Those awful truths that sinners dread to hear:
Sinners in Zion, tremble and retire;
I doom the painted hypocrite to fire.
Not for the want of goats or bullocks slain
Do I condemn thee; bulls and goats are vain
Without the flames of love; in vain the store
Of brutal off'rings that were mine before;
Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed,
Flocks, herds, and fields and forests where they feed.
If I were hungry, would I ask thee food?
When did I thirst, or drink thy bullocks' blood?
Can I be flattered with thy cringing bows,
Thy solemn chatt'rings and fantastic vows?
Are my eyes charmed thy vestments to behold,
Glaring in gems, and gay in woven gold? 
Unthinking wretch! how couldst thou hope to please
A God, a Spirit, with such toys as these,
While, with my grace and statutes on thy tongue,
Thou lov'st deceit, and dost thy brother wrong?
In vain to pious forms thy zeal pretends,
Thieves and adulterers are thy chosen friends.
Silent I waited with long-suff'ring love,
But didst thou hope that I should ne'er reprove?
And cherish such an impious thought within,
That God, the Righteous, would indulge thy sin?
Behold my terrors now: my thunders roll,
And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul.
Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise;
Awake before this dreadful morning rise;
Change your vain thoughts, your crooked works amend,
Fly to the Savior, make the Judge your friend
Lest, like a lion, his last vengeance tear
Your trembling souls, and no deliv'rer near.

The Lord upholds the faltering feet
And makes the weak securely stand;
The burdened ones, bowed down with grief,
Are helped by His most gracious hand.
The eyes of all upon Thee wait,
By Thee their wants are all supplied;
Thine open hand is bountiful,
And every soul is satisfied.

The Lord will come and not be slow,
his footsteps cannot err;
before him righteousness shall go,
his royal harbinger.
Truth from the earth, like to a flower,
shall bud and blossom then;
and justice, from her heavenly bower,
look down on mortal men.
Surely to such as do him fear
salvation is at hand!
And glory shall ere long appear
to dwell within our land.
Rise, God, judge thou the earth in might,
this wicked earth redress;
for thou art he who shalt by right
the nations all possess.
The nations all whom thou hast made
shall come, and all shall frame
to bow them low before thee, Lord,
and glorify thy Name.
For great thou art, and wonders great
by thy strong hand are done:
thou in thy everlasting seat
remainest God alone.

The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want.
he makes me down to lie
in pastures green; he leadeth me
the quiet waters by.
My soul he doth restore again;
and me to walk doth make
within the paths of righteousness,
even for his own Name's sake.
Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
yet will I fear no ill;
for thou art with me; and thy rod
and staff my comfort still.
My table thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes;
my head thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.
Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me;
and in God's house forevermore
my dwelling place shall be.

The love of Christ constraineth;
O let the watchword ring
till all the world adoring
to Jesus' feet it bring.
Till north and south the kingdoms
shall own his glorious sway,
and east and west the nations
rejoice to see his day.
The love of Christ constraineth:
at home, abroad, where'er
by sea or shore abiding
his Name and sign we bear.
We ask not that our service
or great or small may be,
if only thou wilt own it,
dear Lord, as unto thee.
The love of Christ constraineth;
and we who trust his word
who know and feel its power
to gladder services stirred,
shall neither faint nor falter,
though dark the night and long,
and weak our hands that labor;
his strength shall make us strong.
The love of Christ constraineth;
then let us work and pray,
and watch the glad appearing
of that triumphant day,
when Father, Son and Spirit,
by every tongue confessed,
all earth his broad dominion
in his dear love shall rest.

The Magi came from lands afar,
Led by the guidance of a star,
They journeyed on to Bethlehem,
To seek the Savior, born for them.

The Maker of the sun and moon,
the Maker of our earth,
lo! late in time, a fairer boon,
himself is brought to birth!
How blest was all creation then,
when God so gave increase;
and Christ, to heal the hearts of men,
brought righteousness and peace!
No star in all the heights of heaven
but burned to see him go;
yet unto earth alone was given
his human form to know.
His human form, by man denied,
took death for human sin:
his endless love, through faith descried,
still lives the world to win.
O perfect Love, outpassing sight,
O Light beyond our ken,
come down through all the world tonight,
and heal the hearts of men!

The man is ever blest
Who shuns the sinners' ways,
Among their counsels never stands,
Nor takes the scorners' place.

There’s a manger-Babe in a far off land,
But it holds the world in its infant hand;
Just a manger-Babe in its humble bed,
But a matchless crown is upon its head.

The Master comes! He calls for thee 
go forth at his almighty word,
obedient to his last command,
and tell to those who never heard,
who sit in deepest shades of night,
that Christ has come to give them light.
The Master calls! Shall not thy heart
in warm responsive love reply,
"Lord, here am I; send me, send me,
thy willing slave, to live or die 
an instrument unfit indeed,
yet thou wilt give me what I need"?
And if thou canst not go, yet bring
an offering of a willing heart;
then, though thou tarriest at home,
thy God shall give thee too thy part;
the messengers of peace upbear
in ceaseless and prevailing prayer.
Short is the time for service true,
for soon shall dawn that glorious day
when, all the harvest gathered in,
each faithful heart shall hear him say,
"My child, well done! thy toil is o'er 
enter my joy forevermore."

The merits of the saints
blessed for evermore,
their love that never faints,
the toils they bravely bore:
for these the Church today
pours forth her joyous lay:
these victors won the noblest bay.
They, whom this world of ill,
while it yet held, abhorred;
its withering flowers that still
they spurned with one accord:
they knew them short-lived all,
and followed at thy call,
King Jesus, to thy heavenly hall.
Like sheep their blood they poured;
and without groan or tear,
they bent before the sword
for that their King most dear:
their souls, serenely blest,
in patience they possessed,
and looked in hope towards their rest.
What tongue may here declare,
fancy or thought descry,
the joys thou dost prepare
for these thy saints on high!
Empurpled in the flood
of their victorious blood,
they won the laurel from their god.
To thee, O Lord most high,
One in Three Persons still,
to pardon us as we cry,
and to preserve us from ill:
here give thy servants peace,
hereafter glad release,
and pleasures that shall never cease.

The mighty God, the Lord hath spoken,
and bid the trembling earth draw nigh:
the silence of long ages broken,
he speaks in thunder from the sky.
Forth from the heavenly Zion shining,
in perfect beauty he appears:
love, wisdom, majesty combining,
bright are the diadems he wears.
He speaks and all the nations tremble;
heaven, earth and hell his voice obey:
in solemn awe his saints assemble,
the world's dim shadows flee away.
O who can stand when thou appearest
in robes of majesty divine?
Though now each contrite sigh thou hearest,
what terrors then will round thee shine!
O mighty God, O Lord most holy,
prepare us for that solemn day:
O shield and guard us, save us wholly,
thy pardoning grace to us display.

Well, wife, I’ve found the model church,
And worshipped there today;
It made me think of good old times,
Before my hair was gray;
The meeting house was finer built
Than they were years ago,
But then I found when I went in,
It was not built for show.

The morning light is breaking, 
the darkness disappears;
the sons of earth are waking, 
to penitential tears;
each breeze that sweeps the ocean 
brings tidings from afar
of nations in commotion, 
prepared for Zion's war.
Rich dews of grace come o'er us, 
in many a gentle shower,
and brighter scenes before us, 
are opening every hour;
each cry to heaven going, 
abundant answers brings,
and heavenly winds are blowing, 
with peace upon their wings.
See heathen nations bending 
before the God we love,
and thousand hearts ascending 
in gratitude above:
while sinners, now confessing, 
the Gospel call obey,
and seek the Savior's blessing, 
a nation in a day.
Blest river of salvation, 
pursue thy onward way;
flow thou to every nation, 
nor in thy richness stay:
stay not till all the lowly 
triumphant reach their home;
stay not till all the holy 
proclaim, "The Lord is come."

The morning purples all the sky,
The air with praises rings,
Defeated hell stands sullen by,
The world exulting sings.

The morning walks upon the earth,
And man awakes to toil and mirth;
All living things and lands are gay—
Dear God, walk with me through the day.

The name of Jesus is so sweet,I love its music to repeat;It makes my joys full and complete,  The precious name of Jesus.

The Nazarene had come to live the life of every man
And he felt the facination of the stars
And as He wandered through this weary world
He wondered and He wept   
For there were so few who's listen to His call
He came, He saw, He surrendered all
So that we might be born again
And the fact of His humanity was there for all to see
For He was unlike any other man and yet so much like me
The Nazarene could hunger and the Nazarene could cry
And He could laugh with all the fullness of His heart
And those who hardly knew Him, and those who knew Him well
Could feel the contradiction from the start

Because the LORD is my Shepherd

With harps and with viols there stands a great throng
In the presence of Jesus, and sing this new song:

There's a place near to me, where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent
With our friends at the old country church.
As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy
When I knelt in the old country church
And the Savior above, by His wonderful love
Saved my soul at the old country church.
How I wish that today all the people would pray
As we prayed in the old country church
If they'd only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As he did in the old country church.
Of't my thoughts make me weep, for so many now sleep
In their graves near the old country church
And sometime I may rest, with the friends I love best
In a grave near the old country church.
Precious years of memories,
Oh what joy they bring to me ( they bring to me)
How I long once more to be,
With my friends at the old country church.

The old year now hath passed away;
We thank Thee, 0 our God, today
That Thou hast kept us through the year
When danger and distress were near.

O'er all the way green palms and blossoms gay
Are strewn this day in festive preparation,
Where Jesus comes to wipe our tears away;
E'en now the throng to welcome Him prepare.

The people that in darkness sat
a glorious light have seen;
the Light has shined on them who long
in shades of death have been.
To hail thee, Sun of Righteousness,
the gathering nations come,
their joy when the reapers bear
their harvest treasures home.
For thou their burden dost remove,
and break the tyrant's rod,
as in the day when Midian fell
before the sword of God.
For unto us a Child is born,
to us a Son is given;
and on his shoulder ever rests
all power in earth and heaven.
His name shall be the Prince of Peace
the everlasting Lord,
the Wonderful, the Counselor, 
the God by all adored.
His righteous government and power
shall over all extend;
on judgment and on justice based,
his reign shall have no end.
Lord Jesus, reign in us, we pray,
and make us thine alone,
who with the Father ever art
and Holy Spirit One.

The praises of that saint we sing,
to whom all lands their tribute bring,
who with indomitable heart,
bore throughout life true woman's heart.
Restraining every froward sense
by gentle bonds of abstinence,
with prayer her hungry souls she fed,
and thus to heavenly joys hath sped.
King Christ, from whom all virtue springs,
who only doest wondrous things,
as now to thee she kneels in prayer,
in mercy our petitions hear.
All praise to God the Father be,
all praise, eternal Son, to thee;
whom with the Spirit we adore
forever and forevermore.

There’s an eye that watches o’er me,
Everywhere I’m called to go;
There’s a light that shines before me,
Brighter still the way will grow;
There’s a tender hand to guide me,
Thro’ the sunlight and the shade;
There’s a Friend Who walks beside me,
Ready to defend and aid.

The Queen, O God, her heart to thee upraiseth;
with her the nation bows before thy face;
with high thanksgiving thee thy glad Church praiseth,
our strength thy spirit, our trust and hope thy grace.
Unto great honor, glory undesered,
hast thou exalted us and drawn thee nigh;
nor, from thy judgments when our feet had swerved,
didst thou forsake, nor leave us, Lord most high.
In thee our fathers trusted and were saved,
in thee destroyed thrones of tyrants proud;
from ancient bondage freed the poor enslaved;
to sow thy truth poured out their saintly blood.
Unto our minds give freedom and uprightness;
let strength and courage lead o'er land and wave;
to our souls' armor grant celestial brightness,
joy to our hearts and faith beyond the grave.
Our plenteous nation still in power extending,
increase our joy, uphold us by thy word;
beauty and wisdom all our ways attending,
good will to man and peace through Christ our Lord.

The race that long in darkness pined
have seen a glorious light;
the people dwell in day, who dwelt
in death's surrounding night.
To hail thy rise, thou better Sun,
the gathering nations come,
joyous as when the reapers bear
the harvest-treasures home.
To us a Child of hope is born,
to us a Son is given;
him shall the tribes of earth obey,
him all the hosts of heaven.
His name shall be the Prince of Peace
for evermore adored,
the Wonderful, the Counsellor, 
the great and mighty Lord.
His power increasing still shall spread,
his reign no end shall know;
justice shall guard his throne above
and peace abound below.

The radiant morn hath passed away,
and spent too soon her golden store;
the shadows of departing day
creep on once more.
Our life is but an autumn sun,
its glorious noon how quickly past!
Lead us, O Christ, our life work done,
safe home at last.
O by thy soul inspiring grace
uplift our hearts to realms on high;
help us to look to that bright place
beyond the sky.
Where light, and life, and joy, and peace
in undivided empire reign,
and thronging angels never cease
their deathless strain.
Where saints are clothed in spotless white,
and evening shadows never fall;
where thou, eternal Light of light,
art Lord of all.

My Lord Jesus, My Savior 
Your Spirit has shown me Your amazing love
The hours on the cross alone in so much pain
Pouring out Your blood for a wretch like me
For just a moment I could see
I lost my strength, I knew not what to say
O if I only could find the right word
That could give You thanks 
And express what I feel
My Lord Jesus, my Savior
My life on Your altar, a perfect sacrifice
I don’t find in this world a reason to live
If I must I give it all, I just cannot lose You

I’ve never seen the righteous 
forsaken
Nor ever seen his children begging bread
No, I’ve never seen anyone
Who believes in You
And failed to see
The greatness of Your power
The one who believes is never shaken
He looks up to the heavens
And remains strong
And in this confidence I am victorious
Like the mountains of Zion I will remain 

The Righteous Lord, Supremely Great
Maintains His universal state;
O'er all the earth his pow'r extends,
All heav'n before His footstool bends.
Yet justice still with pow'r presides
And mercy all His empire guides;
Mercy and truth are His delight,
And saints are lovely in His sight.
No more, ye wise, your wisdom boast;
No more, ye strong, your valor trust;
No more, ye rich, survey your store,
Elate with heaps of shining ore.
Glory, ye saints, in this alone:
That God, your God, to you is known
That you have owned His sov'reign sway;
That you have felt His cheering ray.
Our wisdom wealth, and pow'r, we find
In one Jehovah all combined;
On him we fix our roving eyes.
And all our souls in raptures rise.
All else, which we are treasure call,
May in one fatal moment fall;
But what their happiness can move,
Whom God, the blessed, designs to love?

O sometimes the shadows are deep,
And rough seems the path to the goal,
And sorrows, sometimes how they sweep
Like tempests down over the soul.

The roseate hues of early dawn, 
the brightness of the day,
the crimson of the sunset sky, 
how fast they fade away!
O for the pearly gates of heaven! 
O for the golden floor!
O for the Sun of Righteousness 
that setteth nevermore!
The highest hopes we cherish here,
how fast they tire and faint!
How many a spot defiles the robe 
that wraps an earthly saint!
O for a heart that never sins! 
O for a soul washed white!
O for a voice to praise our King, 
nor weary day or night!
Here faith is ours, and heavenly hopes, 
and grace to lead us higher;
but there are perfectness and peace 
beyond our best desire.
O by thy love and anguish, Lord, 
O by thy life laid down,
grant that we fall not from thy grace, 
nor cast away our crown!

The royal banners forward go,
the cross shines forth in mystic glow;
where he in flesh, our flesh who made,
our sentence bore, our ransom paid.
Where deep for us the spear was dyed,
life's torrent rushing from his side,
to wash us in that precious flood,
where mingled water flowed, and blood.
Fulfilled is all that David told
in true prophetic song of old,
amidst the nations, God, saith he,
hath reigned and triumphed from the tree.
O tree of beauty, tree of light!
O tree with royal purple dight!
Elect on whose triumphal breast
those holy limbs should find their rest.
Blest tree, whose chosen branches bore
the wealth that did the world restore,
the price of humankind to pay,
and spoil the spoiler of his prey.
Upon its arms, like balance true,
he weighed the price for sinners due,
the price which none but he could pay,
and spoiled the spoiler of his prey.
O cross, our one reliance, hail!
Still may thy power with us avail
to give new virtue to the saint,
and pardon to the penitent.
To thee, eternal Three in One,
let homage meet by all be done:
whom by the cross thou dost restore,
preserve and govern evermore.

The saint who first found grace to pen
the life which was the Life of men,
and shed abroad the Gospel's ray,
his fame we celebrate today.
Lo, drawn by Pentecostal fire,
his heart conceived its great desire,
when pure of mind, inspired, he heard
and with his hand set forth the Word.
Then, clearly writ, the Godhead shone
serene and fair to look upon;
and through that record still comes power
to lighten souls in death's dark hour.
O holy mind, for wisdom fit
wherein that Life of lives stood writ,
may we through minds of like accord
show forth the pattern of our Lord.
And so may all whose minds are dark
be led to truth by good Saint Mark,
and after this our earthly strife
stand written in the Book of Life.

The saints of God! their conflict past,
and life's long battle won at last,
no more they need the shield or sword,
they cast them down before their Lord:
O happy saints! forever blest,
at Jesus feet' how safe your rest!
The saints of God! their wanderings done,
no more their weary course they run,
no more they faint, no more they fall,
no foes oppress, no fears appall:
O happy saints! forever blest,
in that dear home how sweet your rest!
The saints of God! life's voyage o'er,
safe landed on that blissful shore,
no stormy tempests now they dread,
no roaring billows lift their head:
O happy saints! forever blest,
in that calm haven of your rest!
The saints of God their vigil keep,
while yet their mortal bodies sleep,
till from the dust they too shall rise
and soar triumphant to the skies:
O happy saints! rejoice and sing:
he quickly comes, your Lord and King!
O God of saints! to thee we cry;
O Savior! plead for us on high;
O Holy Ghost! our Guide and Friend,
grant us thy grace till life shall end;
that with all the saints our rest may be
in that bright paradise with thee!

The saints on earth and those above
But one communion make;
Joined to their Lord in bonds of love,
All of His grace partake.

The saints who toiled from place to place,
Spreading the Gospel of God's grace,
Now in their heavenly homeland dwell
With Christ, whom here they served so well.
Alert at thy command to go,
And everywhere thy word to sow,
They went, O Master, far and wide,
Eager, but yet unsatisfied.
Thine was the task they took in hand,
Thine their good news for every land,
Thine was their power, and thine again
Their passion for the souls of men.
That task of thine, by them begun,
Must now by our weak hands be done:
Strengthen, O Lord, to work for thee
These hands, at home and over sea.

The sands of time are sinking, 
the dawn of heaven breaks;
the summer morn I've sighed for,
the fair, sweet morn awakes:
dark, dark hath been the midnight, 
but dayspring is at hand,
and glory, glory dwelleth 
in Emmanuel's land.
O Christ, he is the fountain, 
the deep, sweet well of love!
the streams of earth I've tasted 
more deep I'll drink above:
there to an ocean fullness 
his mercy doth expand,
and glory, glory dwelleth 
in Emmanuel's land.
With mercy and with judgment 
my web of time he wove,
and aye, the dews of sorrow 
were lustered with his love;
I'll bless the hand that guided, 
I'll bless the heart that planned
when throned where glory dwelleth 
in Emmanuel's land.
I'll fall asleep in Jesus, 
filled with his likeness rise,
to love and to adore him, 
to see him with these eyes:
the King of kings in Zion
my presence doth command,
where glory, glory dwelleth
in Emmanuel's land.
I've wrestled on towards heaven, 
'gainst storm and wind and tide;
Lord, grant thy weary traveler 
to lean on thee as guide,
And 'mid the shades of evening, 
while sinks life's lingering sand,
to hail the glory dawning 
in Emmanuel's land.

The Savior calls; let every ear
Attend the heavenly sound.
Ye doubting souls, dismiss your fear;
Hope smiles reviving round.
For every thirsty, Ionging heart
Here streams of bounty flow
And life and health and bliss impart
To banish mortal woe.
Here springs of sacred pleasures rise
To ease your every pain;
Immortal fountain, full supplies!
Nor shall you thirst in vain.
Ye sinners, come, 'tis Mercy's voice;
The gracious call obey;
Mercy invites to heavenly joys,
And can you yet delay?
Dear Savior, draw reluctant hearts;
To Thee let sinners fly
And take the bliss Thy love imparts
And drink and never die.

The Savior! O what endless charms,
Dwell in the blissful sound!
Its influence every fear disarms,
And spreads sweet comforts round.

The Saviour died, but rose again
Triumphant from the grave;
And pleads our cause at God's right hand,
Omnipotent to save.
Who then can e'er divide us more
From Jesus and his love,
Or break the sacred chain that binds
The earth to heaven above?
Let troubles rise, and terrors frown,
And days of darkness fall;
Through him all dangers we'll defy,
And more than conquer all.
Nor death nor life, nor earth nor hell,
Nor time's destroying sway,
Can e'er efface us from his heart,
Or make his love decay.
Each future period he will bless,
As he has blessed the past;
He loved us from the first of time,
He loves us to the last.

The Saviour, when to heaven he rose,
In splendid triumph o'er his foes,
Scattered his gifts on men below,
And wide his royal bounties flow.
Hence sprung the Apostles' honoured name;
Sacred beyond heroic fame;
In lowlier forms, to bless our eyes,
Pastors from hence, and teachers rise.
From Christ their varied gifts derive,
And, fed by Christ, their graces live;
While, guarded by his mighty hand,
Midst all the rage of hell they stand.
So shall the bright succession run
Through the last courses of the sun;
While unborn churches by their care
Shall rise and flourish large and fair.
Jesus our Lord their hearts shall know -
The Spring whence all these blessings flow;
Pastors and people shout his praise
Through all the round of endless days.
Amen.

I pledge my spirit loyal
To the service of the King;
The privilege is royal,
In the service of the King;
I pledge to Him forever
My loftiest endeavor,
And naught my soul shall sever
From the service of the King.

The shadows of the evening hours
Fall from the darkening sky;
Upon the fragrance of the flowers
The dews of evening lie;
Before Thy throne, O Lord of heav'n,
We kneel at close of day;
Look on Thy children from on high,
And hear us while we pray.

The shepherds had an angel,
The wise men had a star,
But what have I, a little child,
To guide me home from far
Where glad stars sing together,
And singing angels are?

What ship is this you’re sailing in,
This wondrous ship of fame?
The ship is called the “Church of God"
And Christ’s the Captain’s name.

The ships glide in at the harbor's mouth,
and the ships sail out to sea;
and the wind that sweeps from the sunny south
is sweet as sweet can be.
There's a world of toil and a world of pain,
and a world of trouble and care,
but O, in a world where our Father reigns,
there is gladness everywhere!
The harvest waves in the breezy morn,
and the men go forth to reap;
the fullness comes to the tasseled corn,
whether we wake or sleep.
And far on the hills by feet untrod
there are blossoms that scent the air,
for O, in this world of our Father God,
there is beauty everywhere!

The sky can still remember the earliest Christmas morn,
When in the cold December the Savior Christ was born.
No star unfolds its glory, no trumpet wind is blown,
But tells the Christmas story in music of its own.
O never failing splendor! O never silent song!
Still keep the green earth tender, still keep the gray earth strong,
Still keep the brave earth dreaming of deeds that shall be done,
While children’s lives come streaming like sunbeams from the sun.
O angels sweet and splendid, throng in our hearts and sing
The wonders which attended the coming of the King;
Till we too, boldly pressing where once the shepherds trod,
Climb Bethlehem’s Hill of Blessing, and find the Son of God.

The people of God were not born 
To be enslaved
And to live in pain
In the devil’s domain
The people of God shouldn’t live in the red
And have unanswered prayers
See the land of promise
And yet perish in the desert.
And that’s why I go, I go, I go, I go
To Mount Sinai
Get the promise of my Father
The slavery is over
I have made my decision
Israel carried the gold 
Of those who oppressed him
I am an Israelite too
True Abraham’s descendant
I’m no longer a slave!
And that’s why I go, I go, I go, I go
To Mount Sinai 
Get the promise of my Father
He hears my cry
And answers from above
He prepared us a good land
That flows with milk and honey
God swore unto Abraham
To make us a great nation
I’m no longer a slave!

The snow lay on the ground, the stars shone bright,
when Christ our Lord was born on Christmas night.
Venite adoremus Dominum.
Venite adoremus Dominum.

The son of consolation!
Of Levi's priestly line,
filled with the Holy Spirit
and fervent faith divine,
with lowly self-oblation,
for Christ an offering meet,
he laid his early riches
at the Apostles' feet.
The son of consolation!
O name of soothing balm!
It fell on sick and weary
like breath of heaven's own calm!
And the blest son of comfort
with fearless loving hand
the gentiles' great Apostle
let to the faithful band.
The son of consolation!
Draw near unto his Lord,
he won the martyr's glory,
and passed to his reward;
with him is faith now ended,
for ever lost in sight,
but love, made perfect, fills him
with praise, and joy, and light.
The son of consolation!
Lord, hear our humble prayer,
that each of us your children
this blessed name may bear;
that we, sweet comfort shedding
o'er homes of pain and woe,
'midst sickness and in prisons,
may seek you here below.
The sons of consolation!
O what their bliss will be
when Christ the King shall tell them,
"Ye did it unto me!"
The merciful and loving
the Lord of life shall own,
and as his priceless jewels
shall set them round his throne.

The Son of God goes forth to war, 
a kingly crown to gain;
his blood red banner streams afar: 
who follows in his train?
Who best can drink his cup of woe, 
triumphant over pain,
who patient bears his cross below, 
he follows in his train.
That martyr first, whose eagle eye 
could pierce beyond the grave;
who saw his Master in the sky, 
and called on him to save.
Like him, with pardon on his tongue, 
in midst of mortal pain,
he prayed for them that did the wrong: 
who follows in his train?
A glorious band, the chosen few 
on whom the Spirit came;
twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew, 
and mocked the cross and flame.
They met the tyrant's brandished steel, 
the lion's gory mane;
they bowed their heads the death to feel: 
who follows in their train?
A noble army, men and boys, 
the matron and the maid,
around the Savior's throne rejoice, 
in robes of light arrayed.
They climbed the steep ascent of heaven, 
through peril, toil and pain;
O God, to us may grace be given, 
to follow in their train.

The soul of every man is free
To choose his life and what he'll be;
For this eternal truth is giv'n.
Our God will force no man to heav'n.

The sower went forth sowing,
the seed in secret slept
through weeks of faith and patience,
till our the green blade crept;
and warmed by golden sunshine
and fed by silver rain,
at last the fields were whitened
to harvest once again.
O praise the heavenly Sower,
who gave the fruitful seed,
and watched and watered duly,
and ripened for our need.
Behold the heavenly Sower
goes forth with better seed,
the word of sure salvation,
with feet and hands that bleed;
here in his Church 'tis scattered,
our spirits are the soil;
then let an ample fruitage
repay his pain and toil.
O beauteous is the harvest
wherein all goodness thrives!
And this the true thanksgiving--
the first fruits of our lives.
Within a hallowed acre
he sows yet other grain,
when peaceful earth receiveth
the dead he died to gain;
for though the growth be hidden,
we know that they shall ripen
in sunny Paradise.
O summer land of harvest,
O fields for ever white
with souls that wear Christ's raiment,
with crowns of golden light!
One day the heavenly Sower
shall reap where he hath sown,
and come again rejoicing,
and with him bring his own;
and then the fan of judgment
shall winnow from his floor
the chaff into the furnace
that flameth evermore.
O holy, awful Reaper,
have mercy in the day
thou puttest in thy sickle,
and cast us not away.

The spacious firmament on high,
with all the blue ethereal sky,
and spangled heavens, a shining frame,
their great Original proclaim.
The unwearied sun from day to day
does his Creator's power display;
and publishes to every land
the work of an almighty hand.
Soon as the evening shades prevail,
the moon takes up the wondrous tale,
and nightly to the listening earth
repeats the story of her birth:
whilst all the stars that round her burn,
and all the planets in their turn,
confirm the tidings, as they roll
and spread the truth from pole to pole.
What though in solemn silence all
move round the dark terrestrial ball?
What though no real voice nor sound
amid their radiant orbs be found?
In reason's ear they all rejoice,
and utter forth a glorious voice;
for ever singing as they shine,
"The hand that made us is divine."
O Lord, to thee we pray;
O uncreated Light of Light,
guide thou our way.
Sinless be tongue and hand,
and innocent the mind,
let simple truth be on our lips,
our hearts be kind.
As the swift day rolls on,
still, Lord, our Guardian be,
and keep the portals of our hearts
from evil free.
Grant that our daily toil
may to thy glory tend;
and as our hours begin with thee,
so may they end.

Oh, say can 
you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

The stars declare his glory;
the vault of heaven springs,
mute witness of the Master's hand
in all created things,
and through the silences of space
their soundless music sings.
The dawn returns in splendor,
the heavens burn and blaze,
the rising sun renews the race
that measures all our days,
and writes in fire across the skies
God's majesty and praise.
So shine the Lord's commandments
to make the simple wise;
more sweet than honey to the taste,
more rich than any prize,
a law of love within our hearts,
a light before our eyes.
So order too this life of mine,
direct it all my days;
the meditations of my heart
be innocence and praise,
my rock, and my redeeming Lord,
in all my words and ways.

The strain upraise of joy and praise, Alleluia.
To the glory of their King
shall the ransomed people sing Alleluia, alleluia!
And the choirs that dwell on high
shall re-echo through the sky Alleluia, alleluia!
They through the fields of Paradise that roam,
the blessed ones, The planets beaming on their heavenly way,
the shining constellations join, and say Alleluia, alleluia!
Ye clouds that onward sweep, ye winds on pinions light,
ye thunders, echoing loud and deep, ye lightnings wildly bright,
in sweet consent unite your Alleluia.
Ye floods and ocean billows, ye storms and winter snow,
ye days of cloudless beauty, hoar frost and summer glow,
ye groves that wave in spring, and glorious forests, sing Alleluia.
First let the birds, with painted plumage gay,
exalt their great Creator's praise, and say Alleluia, alleluia!
Then let the beasts of earth, with varying strain,
join in creation's hymn, and cry again Alleluia, alleluia!
Here let the mountains thunder forth sonorous Alleluia!
There let the valleys sing in gentler Alleluia!
Thou jubilant abyss of ocean, cry Alleluia!
Ye tracts of earth and continents, reply Alleluia!
To God, who all creation made, the frequent hymn be duly paid: Alleluia, 
alleluia!
This is the strain, the eternal strain, the Lord Almighty loves: Alleluia!
This is the song, the heavenly song, that Christ the king approves: Alleluia!
Wherefore we sing, both heart and voice awaking, Alleluia!
And children's voices echo, answer making, Alleluia! 
Now from all men be out-poured Alleluia to the Lord;
With Alleluia evermore the Son and Spirit we adore.
Praise be done to the Three in One, Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Amen.

How many sheep are straying
Lost from the Savior's fold!
Upon the lonely mountain, They shiver with the cold:
Within the tangled thickets,
Where poison vines do creep,
And over rocky ledges
Still roam the poor lost sheep.

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
The strife is o'er, the battle done,
the victory of life is won;
the song of triumph has begun.
Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
The powers of death have done their worst,
but Christ their legions hath dispersed:
let shout of holy joy outburst.
Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
The three sad days are quickly sped,
he rises glorious from the dead:
all glory to our risen Head!
Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
He closed the yawning gates of hell,
the bars from heaven's high portals fell;
let hymns of praise his triumphs tell!
Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
Lord! by the stripes which wounded thee,
from death's dread sting thy servants free,
that we may live and sing to thee.
Alleluia!

The summer days are come again;
once more the glad earth yields
her golden wealth of ripening grain,
and breath of clover fields,
and deepening shade of summer woods,
and glow of summer air,
and winging thoughts and happy moods
of love and joy and prayer.
The summer days are come again;
the birds are on the wing;
God's praises, in their loving strain,
unconsciously they sing.
We know who giveth all the good
that doth our cup o'erbrim;
for summer joy in field and wood
we lift our song to him.

The sun arises now
In light and glory
And gilds the rugged brow
Of mountains hoary,
Be glad, my soul, and lift
Thy voice in singing
To God from earth below,
Thy heart with joy aglow
And praises ringing.

The sun is sinking fast,
the daylight dies;
let love awake, and pay
her evening sacrifice.
As Christ upon the cross
his head inclined,
and to his Father's hands
his parting soul resigned;
So now herself my soul
would wholly give
into his sacred charge
in whom all spirits live;
So now beneath his eye
would calmly rest,
without a wish or thought
abiding in the breast;
Save that his will be done,
whate'er betide;
dead to herself, and dead
in him to all beside.
Thus would I live: yet now
not I, but he,
in all his power and love,
henceforth alive in me.
One sacred Trinity,
one Lord divine,
may I be ever his,
and he for ever mine.

The sun's last beam of light is gone,
The shades of night come swiftly on;
O Christ, our Light, upon us shine
Lest we to sin's dark ways incline.

I am trav’ling tow’rd the sunset gate,
I’m a pilgrim going home;
For the glow of eventide I wait,
I’m a pilgrim going home.

I think when I read that sweet story of old,
When Jesus was here among men,
How he called little children as lambs to His fold,
I should like to have been with them then.
I should like to have been with them then,
I should like to have been with them then,
How he called little children as lambs to His fold,
I should like to have been with them then.

Once, forth to meet the bridegroom,
At night ten virgins went;
Five lamps were trimmed for burning,
In five the oil was spent,
And while they slept and slumbered,
At midnight rose the shout
Behold the bridegroom cometh,
To meet him go ye out.

The tender love a father has
For all his children dear,
Such love the Lord bestows on them
Who worship Him in fear.

One thought I have, my ample creed,
So deep it is and broad,
And equal to my every need—
It is the thought of God.

The toil of brain, or heart, or hand,
Is man’s appointed lot;
He who God’s call can understand,
Will work and murmur not.
Toil is no thorny crown of pain,
Bound round man’s brow for sin;
True souls, from it, all strength may gain,
High manliness may win.

There are days so dark that I seek in vain
For the face of my Friend divine;
But though darkness hide, He is there to guide
By the touch of His hand on mine.

YOU SHALL GO OUT WITH JOY
AND BE LED FORTH WITH PEACE
THE MOUNTAINS AND THE HILLS
WILL BREAK FORTH BEFORE YOU
THERE'LL BE SHOUTS OF JOY AND
ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD WILL
CLAP WILL CLAP THEIR HANDS
AND ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD WILL
CLAP THEIR HANDS (CLAP CLAP)
THE TREES OF THE FIELD WILL
CLAP THEIR HANDS (CLAP CLAP)
THE TREES OF THE FIELD WILL
CLAP THEIR HANDS (CLAP CLAP)
WHILE YOU GO OUT WITH JOY

The trespass of the wicked man
Most plainly testifies
That fear of God’s most holy Name
Is not before his eyes.

The triumphs of the saints,
The toils they bravely bore,
The love that never faints,
Their glory evermore—
For these the Church today
Pours forth her joyous lay;
What victors wear so rich a bay?

The true Messiah now appears,
The types are all withdrawn;
So fly the shadows and the stars
Before the rising dawn.

I was wandering and weary
When my Savior came unto me;
For the ways of sin grew dreary,
And the world has ceased to woo me;
And I thought I heard Him say,
As He came along His way,

To man, it seemed that Evil had prevailed,
That His fair life had altogether failed,
And naught was left but what the Cross impaled—
But God saw otherwise!

Once our blessed Christ of beauty
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suffering, death and sorrow
He has rent the veil in two.

When I’m sad and heavy laden,
Burdened with the weight of sin,
Jesus is the very Friend I need;
To the bloodstained cross He points me,
And He gives me peace within,
Jesus is the very Friend I need.

Come, sinners, to the living One,
He’s just the same Jesus
As when He raised the widow’s son,
The very same Jesus.

The Virgin Mary had a baby boy,
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy,
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy,
And they say that His name is Jesus.

Last night I went to bed and after  I had gone to sleep,
 Sometime in the night I had this  vision come to me.
I saw a place so beautiful with  gold and jewels rare;
Everyone wearing white robes and  singing everywhere.
Their voices were so lovely and in perfect harmony.
The multitude that gathered was as far as I could see.
There wasn't any difference everybody looked the same,
Singing praises to the Lamb, praise His holy name.
There were no crippled, blind, or any kind of disease,
Everyone so young and fair, there were no elderly.
From the flood and through the blood each on that had believed,
Were gathered home around the Throne for all eternity.
When I awoke I had this happy feeling in my soul,
For I believe He let me see the place where I would go.
For I've been saved through grace through faith, I am one of His own,
And I'll be in that number I saw gathered round the Throne.
Last night I went to bed and after I had gone to sleep,
Sometime in the night I had this vision come to me.

The voice of God goes out to all the world;
His glory speaks across the universe.
The great King's herald cries from star to star:
With power, with justice, he will walk his way.
The Lord has said: 'Receive my messenger,
My promise to the world, my pledge made flesh,
A lamp to every nation, light from light':
With power, with justice, he will walk his way.
The broken reed he will not trample down,
Nor set his heel upon the dying flame.
He binds the wounds, and health is in his hand:
With power, with justice, he will walk his way.
Anointed with the Spirit and with power,
He comes to crown with comfort all the weak,
To show the face of justice to the poor:
With power, with justice, he will walk his way.
His touch will bless the eyes that darkness held,
The lame shall run, the halting tongue shall sing,
And prisoners laugh in light and liberty:
With power, with justice, he will walk his way.

The Voice of the Shepherd His Flock Shall Convene
And lead them to pastures all fertile and green
But unto the stranger they will not draw near,
Who calls to deceive them, "Lo here and lo there."
The blood of the Shepherd His flock did redeem;
Grace, mercy, and peace came to sinners by Him;
'Tis He who hath told them of such to beware,
Who cry like deceivers, "Lo here, and lo there."
He calls them by name, and before them He goes,
To guide, guard, and succor His lambs from their foes;
And, glory to Jesus, His church is His care,
Though oft they do halt 'twixt "Lo here, and lo there."
Those gospel pretenders the wall will leap o'er,
And enter the sheep-fold, though not by the door;
And fraught with delusion, and hardened to fear,
Shall cry in confusion, "Lo here, and lo there."
The Scriptures declare that deceivers shall come,
And thousands to final destruction shall run;
But saints by their calling shall still persevere,
While hirelings are bawling, "Lo here, and lo there."
The way to the Father is Jesus the Son,
In all that He suffered, in all that He's done;
And this shall the heralds of Jesus declare,
Till folded in Zion His sheep shall appear.

The voice that breathed o'er Eden, 
that earliest wedding day,
the primal wedding blessing, 
it hath not passed away.
Still in the pure espousal 
of Christian man and maid
the Triune God is with us, 
the threefold grace is said.
For dower of blessed children,
for love and faith's sweet sake,
for high mysterious union
which naught on earth may break.
Be present, loving Father, 
to give away this bride
as thou gav'st Eve to Adam, 
out of his own pierced side;
Be present, Son of Mary, 
to join their loving hands
as thou didst bind two natures 
in thine eternal bands.
Be present, holiest Spirit, 
to bless them as they kneel,
as thou for Christ, the Bridegroom, 
the heavenly Spouse dost seal.
Oh, spread thy pure wing o'er them, 
let no ill power find place
when onward to thine altar 
the hallowed path they trace.
To cast their crowns before thee 
in humble sacrifice,
till to the home of gladness 
with Christ's own Bride they rise.

The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin;
The light of the world is Jesus;
Like sunshine at noonday His glory shone in,
The light of the world is Jesus.

The will of God is always best
And shall be done forever;
And they who trust in Him are blest,
He will forsake them never.
He helps indeed In time of need,
He chastens with forbearing;
They who depend On God, their Friend,
Shall not be left despairing.

The winged herald of the day
proclaims the morn's approaching ray:
and Christ the Lord our souls excites,
and so to endless life invites.
Take up thy bed, to each he cries,
who sick or wrapped in slumber lies;
and chaste and just and sober stand
and watch: my coming is at hand.
With earnest cry, with tearful care,
call we the Lord to hear our prayer;
while supplication, pure and deep,
forbids each chastened heart to sleep.
Do thou, O Christ, our slumber wake:
do thou the chains of darkness break;
purge thou our former sins away,
and in our souls new light display.
All laud to God the Father be,
all praise, eternal Son, to thee;
all glory, as is ever meet,
to God the holy Paraclete.

The winter's sleep was long and deep,
but earth is awakened and gay;
for the life ne'er dies that from God doth rise,
and the green comes after the grey.
So God doth bring the world to spring;
and on their holy day
the Church proclaims her Apostles' fame,
to welcome the first of May.
Two Saints of God went by the road
that leadeth on to light;
and they gave up all at their Master's call,
to work in their Master's sight.
Would Philip's mind the Father find?
Lo, he has found the Way;
for to know the Son is to know the One
whom the earth and the heavens obey.
And, James, 'twas thine by grace divine
to preach the Christian life,
where our faith is shown by our works alone,
and love overcometh strife.
Lord, grant that we may brethren be, 
as Christians live in deed;
for it is but so we can learn to know
the truth that to thee doth lead.

The man who hears
The Word of God
Is like one
Who built his house upon a Rock
The rain was heavy
Causing rivers to flood
The winds blew
Against his house
But firmly, upon the Rock
He remained
But he who heard
The Word of God
And lived it not
On the sand he built
And his life he destroyed

The wise may bring their learning, 
the rich may bring their gold;
and some may bring their greatness, 
and glories new and old;
we, too, would bring our treasures 
to offer to the King;
we have no wealth nor wisdom; 
what shall we children bring?
We'll bring him hearts that love him; 
we'll bring him thankful praise,
and young souls meekly striving 
to walk in holy ways;
and these shall be the treasures 
we offer to the King,
and these are gifts that even
the poorest child may bring.
We'll bring the little duties 
we have to do each day;
we'll try our best to please him, 
at home, at school, at play;
and better are these treasures 
to offer to our King;
than richest gifts without them,
yet these a child may bring.

There's the wonder of 
sunset at evening,
The wonder as sunrise I see;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is the wonder that God loves me.
O, the wonder of it all! The wonder of it all!
Just to think that God loves me.
O, the wonder of it all! The wonder of it all!
Just to think that God loves me.
There's the wonder of springtime and harvest,
The sky, the stars, the sun;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is a wonder that's only begun.

O the wonder of the story
Of the night so long ago,
In the glimmer of the starlight
And the whiteness of the snow,
When the little Prince of Judah
In His beauty came to birth,
While the angels sang His glory
And His sweetness filled the earth!

How grand and how bright
That wonderful night,
When angels to Bethlehem came!
They burst forth like fires,
They struck their gold lyres,
And mingled their song with the flame.

The word of God, proceeding forth
yet leaving not his Father's side,
and going to his work on earth
had reached at length life's eventide.
By false disciple to be given
to foemen, for his blood athirst,
himself, the living Bread from heaven,
he gave to his disciples first.
In twofold form of sacrament
he gave his Flesh, he gave his Blood,
that man, of twofold substance blent,
might wholly feed on mystic food.
In birth man's fellow-man was he,
his meat while sitting at the board;
he died, his ransomer to be,
he reigns to be his great reward.
O saving Victim! opening wide
the gate of heaven to man below,
our foes press hard on every side,
thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.
All praise and thanks to thee ascend
for evermore, blest One in Three;
O grant us life that shall not end
in our true native land with thee.

The Word of God shall ever stand,
Though stormed by every foe;
Upheld by His almighty hand,
No powers can overthrow.
Though all the powers of hell engage,
And hosts of sin assail
God’s wondrous might, His changeless Word
Shall evermore prevail.

The Word whom earth and sea and sky
adore and laud and magnify,
whose might they show, whose praise they tell,
in Mary's body deigned to dwell.
How blessed that Mother, in whose shrine
the world's Creator, Lord divine,
whose hand contains the earth and sky,
once deigned, as in his ark, to lie.
Blest in the message Gabriel brought,
blest by the work the Spirit wrought;
more blest to bring to human birth
the long-desired of all the earth.
Lord Jesus, Virgin-born, to thee
eternal praise and glory be,
whom with the Father we adore
and Holy Spirit everrmore.

The world is very evil, 
the times are waxing late,
be sober and keep vigil, 
the Judge is at the gate.
The Judge who comes in mercy, 
the Judge who comes in might,
who comes to end the evil, 
who comes to crown the right.
Arise, arise, good Christian, 
let right to wrong succeed;
let penitential sorrow 
to heavenly gladness lead,
to light that has no evening, 
that knows nor moon nor sun,
the light so new and golden, 
the light that is but one.
O home of fadeless splendor, 
of flowers that bear no thorn,
where they shall dwell as children
who here as exiles mourn!
'Midst power that knows no limit, 
where wisdom has no bound,
The beatific vision 
shall glad the saints around.
O happy, holy portion, 
reflection for the blest,
true vision of true beauty, 
true cure of the distressed!
Strive, man, to win that glory; 
toil, man, to gain that light;
send hope before to grasp it, 
till hope be lost in sight.

The year is gone, beyond recall,
with all its hopes and fears,
with all its bright and gladdening smiles,
with all its mourners' tears.
Thy thankful people praise thee, Lord,
for countless gifts received;
and pray for grace to keep the faith
which saints of old believed.
To thee we come, O gracious Lord,
the newborn year to bless;
defend our land from pestilence,
give peace and plenteousness.
Forgive this nation's many sins,
the growth of vice restrain;
and help us all with sin to strive,
and crowns of life to gain.
From evil deeds that stain the past
we now desire to flee;
and pray that future years may all
be spent, good Lord, for thee.
O Father, let thy watchful eye
still look on us in love,
that we may praise thee, year by year,
with angel hosts above.
All glory to the Father be,
all glory to the Son,
all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,
while endless ages run.

The year is swiftly waning,
the summer days are past;
and life, brief life, is speeding;
the end is nearing fast.
The ever-changing seasons
in silence come and go;
but thou, eternal Father,
no time or change canst know.
O, pour thy grace upon us,
that we may worthier be,
each year that passes o'er us,
to dwell in heaven with thee.
Behold the bending orchards
with bounteous fruit are crowned;
Lord, in our hearts more richly
let heavenly fruits abound.
O, by each mercy sent us,
and by each grief and pain,
by blessings like the sunshine,
and sorrows like the rain.
Our barren hearts make fruitful
with every goodly grace,
that we thy Name may hallow,
and see at last thy face.

Thee, living Christ, our eyes behold
amid thy Church appearing,
all girt about thy breast with gold
and bright apparel wearing;
thy countenance is burning light,
a sun that shineth in his might:
Lord Christ, we see thy glory.
Thy glorious feet have sought and found
thy sons of every nation;
thine everlasting voice doth sound
the call of our salvation;
thine eyes of flame do search and scan
the whole outspreading realm of man:
Lord Christ, we see thy glory.
O risen Christ, who art alive,
amid thy Church abiding,
who dost thy Blood and Body give
new life and strength providing,
we join in heavenly company
to sing thy praise triumphantly:
for we have seen thy glory.

Thee, O Christ, the 
Father’s splendor,
Life and virtue of the 
heart,
In the presence of the 
angels
Sing we now with 
tuneful art,
Meetly in alternate 
,
Bearing our responsive 
part.

Thee, O Immanuel, we praise,
The Prince of Life and Fount of Grace,
The Morning Star, the Heav’nly Flower,
The virgin’s Son, the Lord of Power.

Thee we adore, 
eternal Lord!
We praise Thy Name 
with one accord.
Thy saints, who here 
Thy goodness see,
Through all the 
world do worship 
Thee,
Through all the 
world do worship 
Thee.

Thee we adore, O 
hidden Savior, 
Thee,
Who in Thy 
sacrament dost 
deign to be;
Both flesh and 
spirit at Thy 
presence fail,
Yet here Thy 
presence we 
devoutly hail.

Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength,
My rock, my tower, my high defense;
Thy mighty arm shall be my trust,
For I have found salvation thence.

Thee will I 
love, my 
Strength, my 
Tower,
Thee will I 
love, my Joy, my 
Crown,
Thee will I love 
with all my 
power,
In all Thy 
works, and Thee 
alone;
Thee will I 
love, till the 
pure fire
Fill my whole 
soul with chaste 
desire.

Thee will I praise with all my heart,
And tell to all how good thou art,
How marvellous thy works of grace;
Thy name I will in songs record,
And joy and glory in my Lord,
Extolled above all thanks and praise.
The Lord will save his people here;
In times of need their help is near
To all by sin and hell oppressed;
And they that know thy name will trust
In thee, who, to thy promise just,
Hast never left a soul distressed.
The Lord is by his judgements known;
He helps his poor afflicted one,
His sorrows all he bears in mind;
The mourner shall not always weep,
Who sows in tears in joy shall reap,
With grief who seeks with joy shall find.
A helpless soul that looks to thee
Is sure at last thy face to see,
And all thy goodness to partake;
The sinner who for thee doth grieve,
And longs, and labours to believe,
Thou never, never wilt forsake.

There came a little Child to earth
Long ago;
And the angels of God proclaimed His birth,
High and low.

There is a better world, they say
O so bright! O so bright!
Where sin and woe are done away,
O so bright! O so bright!
And music fills the balmy air,
And angels with bright wings are there,
And harps of gold and mansions fair,
O so bright! O so bright!

There is a blissful home on high,
From sin and sorrow free,
Beyond the gaze of mortal eye,
In love's unbounded sea.
There Christians all shall meet ere long
And all their voices raise
Together in a joyful song
Of never-ending praise.
There we shall our Redeemer greet
And see him as he is,
And dwell forever at his feet,
And know that we are his.
There we shall need no lamp by night,
For night shall never come;
Our God is the unfailing light
Of that sweet, happy home.

There is a Book that all may read,

There is a safe and secret place,
Beneath the wings divine,
Reserved for all the heirs of grace;
O be that refuge mine!

There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel’s veins;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

Since I lost my sins and I found my Savior,
There is glory in my soul!
Since by faith I sought and obtained God’s favor,
There is glory in my soul!

There is a green hill far away,
Outside a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.

There is a house not made with hands
Eternal and on high,
And here my spirit waiting stands
Till God shall bit it fly.
Shortly this prison of my clay.
Must be dissolved and fall,
Then, O my soul, with joy obey
Thy heav'nly Father's call.
'Tis he, by his almighty grace,
That forms thee fit for heav'n.
And, as an earnest of the place.
Has his own Spirit giv'n.
We walk by faith of joys to come;
Faith lives upon his word;
And while the body is our home
We're absent from the Lord.
'Tis pleasant to believe thy grace,
But we had rather see;
We would be absent from the flesh,
And present, Lord, with thee.

There is a Land Mine Eye Hath Seen
In visions of enraptured thought; So bright that all which spreads between
Is with its radiant glory fraught;
A land upon whose blissful shore
There rests no shadow, falls no stain;
There those who meet shall part no more,
And those long parted meet again.
Its skies are not like earthly skies,
With varying hues of shade and light;
It hath no need of suns to rise,
To dissipate the gloom of night.
There sweeps no desolating wind
Across that calm, serene abode;
The wand'rer there a home may find,
Within the Paradise of God.

There is a land of pure delight,
Where saints immortal reign,
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never-with'ring flow'rs;
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heav'nly land from ours.
Sweet fields, beyond the swelling flood,
Stand dressed in living green;
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.
But tim'rous mortals start and shrink
To cross this narrow sea;
And linger, shiv'ring on the brink
And fear to launch away.
O! could we make our doubts remove,
Those gloomy doubts that rise,
And see the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes.
Could we but climb where Moses stood,
And view the landscape o'er;
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood.
Should fright us from the shore.

There is a mighty question we ask when nations rage:
Just when will be Christ’s coming, the ending of the age?
Take care, said Jesus clearly, for many will appear;
They’ll claim to be Messiah, yet people should not fear.

There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

There is a Name most sweet on earth,
a Name most sweet in heaven,
the Name before his wondrous birth
to Christ the Savior given.

There Is A Name Whose Music Thrills 
The souls with pure delight;
Before the everlasting hills
It stood and now its glory fills
All length and breadth and height.
Before the morning stars their song
Together sang on high,
In rapture it was borne along,
Unuttered by a mortal tongue,
But known to Deity.
Through all the ages it has been
A tow'r of strong defense,
A solid rock whereon to lean,
A sure relief from guilt and sin,
Our perfect righteousness.
It takes the sting of death away,
And glorifies the grave;
It turns the darkest night to day,
And sinners born again can say
It has the power to save.
It is the all-prevailing name
Of Jesus, Priest, and King,
The Lamb of God, on Calv'ry slain,
Who will in His Triumphant reign
His saints to glory bring.

There is a period known to God
When all his sheep redeemed by blood
Shall leave the hateful ways of sin
Trun to the fold, and enter in

There is a place of hallowed peace
For those with cares oppressed,
When sighs and sorr'wing tears shall cease,
And all be hushed to rest.
'T is then the soul is freed from fears
And doubts which here annoy;
There they that oft had sown in tears
Shall reap again in joy.
There is a home of sweet repose,
Where storms assail no more,
The stream of endless pleasure flows
On that celestial shore.
There purity with love appears,
And bliss without alloy;
There they that oft had sown in tears
Shall reap again in joy.

There is a place of quiet rest,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where sin cannot molest,
Near to the heart of God.

There came a sound from Heaven,
Like a rushing mighty wind,
It filled their hearts with singing,
And gave them peace within,
The Prophet gave this promise,
The Spirit will descend,
And from your inner being,
A river with no end.

There is a Savior what joys express
His eyes are mercy
His word is rest
For each tomorrow
For yesterday
There is a Savior
Who lights our way!

There is a spot to me more dear
Than native vale or mountain,
A spot for which affection's tear
Springs grateful from its fountain.
'T is not where kindred souls abound
Though that on earth is heaven,
But where I first my Saviour found,
And felt my sins forgiven.
Hard was my toil to reach the shore,
Long tossed upon the ocean;
Above me was the thunder's roar,
Beneath, the waves' commotion.
Darkly the pall of night was thrown
Around me, faint with terror;
In that dark hour how did my goran
Ascend for years of error!
Sinking and panting as for breath,
I knew not help was near me,
And cried, "O save me, Lord, from death!
Immortal Jesus, hear me!"
Then, quick as thought, I felt him mine
My Saviour stood before me;
I saw his brightness round me shine,
And shouted, "Glory, glory!"
O sacred hour! O hallowed spot!
Where love divine first found me!
Wherever falls my distant lot,
My heart shall linger round thee!
And when from earth I rise to soar
Up to my home in heaven,
Down will I cast my eyes once more,
Where I was first forgiven.

There is a stream whose current flows
As ceaseless as the sun;
Onward, with sorrows, pains, and woes,
Its troubled waters run.
Still onward, pressing to its source 
The ocean, whence it came;
Nor stayed by circumstance nor force,
Is this resistless stream.
On its broad bosom as it glides,
Are heedless mortals borne;
And in the boundless ocean hides,
The friends for whom we mourn.
The high, the low, are swept away,
The youth, in all his prime,
The meek, the mournful, and the gay,
By the great

There is an hour of peaceful rest,
To mourning wand’rers given;
There is a joy for souls distressed,
A balm for every wounded breast,
'Tis found above in Heav’n.

There is an hour of peaceful rest,
To mourning wand’rers given;
There is a joy for souls distressed,
A balm for every wounded breast,
’Tis found above in Heav’n.

There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee;
Then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,
Unto Him Who was nailed to the tree.

There is no name so sweet on earth,
No name so sweet in Heaven,
The Name, before His wondrous birth
To Christ the Savior given.

There is no night in Heaven;
In that blest world above
Work never can bring weariness,
For work itself is love.

There is no sorrow, Lord, too light
To bring in prayer to Thee;
There is no anxious care too slight
To wake Thy sympathy.

When we think of earth’s trials and cares,
And the tears that our eyelids bedew,
And are told they’re in Heaven unknown,
It seems just too good to be true.

There is one Way, and only one,
Out of our gloom, and sin, and care,
To that far land where shines no sun
Because the face of God is there.

Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

There is power, in this place
There is power, in this place
I can feel a great power here today
I can feel God is blessing His people today

There is sound of rejoicing around the great throne,
A whisper of myriad wings;
For the foe that accuseth us lies cast down,
And the choir of angels sings—

There is sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light.

There seems a voice in every gale,
A tongue in every flower,
Which tells, O Lord, the wondrous tale
Of Thy almighty power.

There shall be showers of blessing:
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Savior above.

There was joy in Heaven,
There was joy in Heaven,
When this goodly world to frame
The Lord of might and mercy came;
Shouts of joy were heard on high,
And the stars sang from the sky,
Glory to God in Heav'n.

There was One who was willing to die n my stead,
That a soul so unworthy might live,
And the path to the cross He was willing to tread
All the sins of my life to forgive.

There were ninety and nine that safely lay
in the shelter of the fold.
but one was out on the hills away,
far off from the gates of gold.
away on the mountains wild and bare.
away from the tender Shepherd's care.
away from the tender Shepherd's care.
"Lord, thou hast here thy ninety and nine;
are they not enough for thee?"
But the Shepherd made answer: "this of mine
has wandered away from me;
and although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find my sheep,
I go to the desert to find my sheep."
But none of the ransomed ever knew
how deep were the waters crossed;
nor how dark was the night the Lord passed through
ere he found his sheep that was lost.
out in the desert he heard its cry,
sick and helpless and ready to die;
sick and helpless and ready to die.
"Lord, whence are those blood drops all the way
that mark out the mountain's track?"
"they were shed for one who had gone astray
ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
"Lord, whence are thy hands so rent and torn?"
"They are pierced tonight by many a thorn;
they are pierced tonight by many a thorn."
And all through the mountains, thunder riven
and up from the rocky steep,
there arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven,
"Rejoice! I have found My sheep!"
and the angels echoed around the throne,
"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back his own!
rejoice, for the Lord brings back his own!"

Whithersoever Thou goest
Let me Thy footsteps attend;
Jesus, my wonderful Savior,
Loving Redeemer and Friend.

There where the judges gather
A Greater takes His seat;
“How long," He asks the judges,
“Will ye pronounce deceit?
How long respect the persons
Of them of ill repute?
How long neglect the orphaned,
The poor and destitute?

There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes;
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

There'll be no night in Heav'n,
In that blest world above;
No anxious toil, no weary hours;
For labor there is love.

There’ll be room enough in Heaven,
There’ll be room enough for me,
If I bear the cross of Jesus,
And a faithful follower be.

There’s a ever ringing
From the portals of the blest,
’Tis the of redeemed ones,
Who have entered into rest.

There's a fight to be fought, there's a work to be done,
and a foe to be met ere the set of the sun,
and the call is gone out o'er the land far and wide.
Who'll follow the banner? Who's on the Lord's side?

There’s a fountain free, ’tis for you and me:
Let us haste, O haste to its brink;
 ’Tis the fount of love from the Source above,
And He bids us all freely drink.

There’s a Friend for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
A Friend who never changes,
Whose love will never die;
Our earthly friends may fail us,
And change with changing years,
This Friend is always worthy
Of that dear Name He bears.

There's a friend for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
A Friend who never changes,
Whose love will never die:
Our earthly friends may fail us,
And change with changing years;
This Friend is always worthy
Of that dear name he bears.
There's a rest for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
Who love the blessed Saviour,
And to the Father cry:
A rest from every turmoil,
From sin and sorrow free,
Where every little pilgrim
Shall rest eternally.
There's a home for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
Where Jesus reigns in glory,
A home of peace and joy:
No home on earth is like it,
Nor can with it compare;
For everyone is happy,
Nor could be happier, there.
There's a crown for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
And all who look for Jesus
Shall wear it by and by:
A crown of brightest glory,
Which he will then bestow
On those who found his favour
And loved his name below.
There's a song for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
A song that will not weary,
Though sung continually:
A song which even angels
Can never, never sing;
They know not Christ as Saviour,
But worship him as King.
There's a robe for little children
Above the bright blue sky;
And a harp of sweetest music,
And palms of victory.
All, all above is treasured,
And found in Christ alone:
Lord, grant thy little children
To know thee as their own.

There’s a great day coming, a great day coming;
There’s a great day coming by and by,
When the saints and the sinners shall be parted right and left,
Are you ready for that day to come?

There’s a hill lone and grey, in a land far away,
In a country beyond the blue sea,
Where beneath that fair sky went a Man forth to die
For the world and for you and for me.

There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by faith's decree
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

Through the valley of the shadow I must go,
Where the cold waves of Jordan roll;
But the promise of my Shepherd I will know,
Be the rod and the staff to my soul.
Even now down the valley as I glide,
I can hear my Savior say, “Follow me!"
And with Him I’m not afraid to cross the tide;
There’s a light in the valley for me.

There’s a light upon the mountains,
And the day is at the spring,
When our eyes shall see the beauty
And the glory of the King:
Weary was our heart with waiting,
And the night watch seemed so long,
But His triumph day is breaking
And we hail it with a song.

There’s a picture fair and bright,
Hanging still on memory’s wall:
There I see my father take the Book divine;
Dear home faces gathered round,
As the shadows softly fall,
And a light from out the pages seems to shine.

There’s a song in the air! There’s a star in the sky!
There’s a mother’s deep prayer and a baby’s low cry!
And the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing,
For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!

There's a spirit in the air,
telling Christians everywhere:
"Praise the love that Christ revealed,
living, working in our world."
Lose your shyness, find your tongue;
tell the world what God has done:
God in Christ has come to stay,
we can see his power today.
When believers break the bread
when a hungry child is fed:
praise the love that Christ revealed
living, working in our world.
Still his Spirit leads the fight,
seeing wrong and setting right:
God in Christ has come to stay,
we can see his power today.
When a stranger's not alone,
where the homeless find a home,
praise the love that Christ revealed,
living, working in our world.
May the Spirit fill our praise,
guide our thoughts and change our ways:
God in Christ has come to stay,
we can see his power today.
There's a Spirit in the air,
calling people everywhere:
praise the love that Christ revealed,
living, working in our world.

There’s a sweet and blessed story
Of the Christ Who came from glory
Just to rescue me from sin and misery.
He in lovingkindness sought me,
And from and sin shame hath brought me.
Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.

There’s a sweet, sweet Spirit in this place
And I know that it’s the Spirit of the Lord
There are sweet expressions on each face
And I know they feel the presence of the Lord 
Sweet Holy Spirit.sweet heavenly dove.
Stay right here with us
Filling us with Your love
And for these blessings 
We lift our hearts in praise
Without a doubt we know
That we’ll have been revived
When we shall leave this place

There’s a voice in the wilderness crying,
A call from the ways untrod:
Prepare in the desert a highway,
A highway for our God!
The valleys shall be exalted,
The lofty hills brought low;
Make straight all the crooked places,
Where the Lord our God may go!

There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,
Like the wideness of the sea;
There’s a kindness in His justice,
Which is more than liberty.

There's no disappointment in Heaven,
No weariness, sorrow or pain;
No hearts that are bleeding and broken,
No song with a minor .
The clouds of our earthly horizon
Will never appear in the sky,
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
With never a sob or a sigh.

There’s no friend to me like Jesus,
He my ev’ry need supplies;
He not only saves but keeps me,
Nothing good from me denies.

There’s no other name like Jesus,
’Tis the dearest name we know,
’Tis the angel’s joy in Heaven,
’Tis the Christian’s joy below.

There’s not a bird with lonely nest,
In pathless wood or mountain crest,
Nor meaner thing, which does not share,
O God, in Thy paternal care.

There's not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:  No, not one! no, not one!None else could heal all our souls' diseases:  No, not one! no, not one! 

There’s not a tint that paints the rose,
Or decks the lily fair,
Or streaks the humblest flower that blows,
But God has placed it there.

There’s only one way that this lost world may know
That Jesus for sinners hath died;
To spread the glad tidings He’s bidden us go,
And no other way doth provide.

There’s peace and rest in paradise,
In weary hours we say;
And oh that we had wings like doves
That we might flee away!

These glorious minds, how bright they shine!
Whence all their white array?
How came they to the happy seats
Of everlasting day?

They come, God’s messengers of love,
They come from realms of peace above,
From homes of never fading light,
From blissful mansions ever bright.

They did not build in vain
who founded here a church
as witness to God's love
amid a world of pain;
for still to those who wish to see,
this place proclaims God's mystery.
They built upon the rock
that is the risen Lord,
the one foundation laid
which stands each earthly shock;
that, Spirit-filled, we here might raise,
as living temples, prayer and praise.
Those who have loved this place,
a cloud of witnesses,
surround and urge us on
as we now run our race;
and so we lay aside each sin
in our resolve to strive and win.
Though the horizon's bend
conceals the way ahead,
the footprints on the road
show Christ waits at the end.
In him alone, our faith shall stand,
who waits for us at God's right hand.
In every place our world
is storm and tempest tossed;
the flames of fear and hate
are evil's flags unfurled;
yet still the Spirit's wind and fire
pour gifts for service in this hour.
Here is our meeting place
where doubt finds grounds of faith;
where hurt finds healing love,
our penitence finds grace;
where bridging time to eternity
is God the Holy Trinity.

They have gone to the land where the patriarchs rest,
Where the bones of the prophets are laid,
Where the chosen of Israel the promise possessed,
And Jehovah His mandate displayed.
To the land where the Savior of sinners once trod,
Where He labored and languished and died;
Where He triumphed o’er death and ascended to God,
As He captive captivity led.

They tell me the story of Jesus is old,
And they ask that we preach something new;
They say that the Babe, and the Man of the cross,
For the wise of this world will not do.

O list to the voice of the prophet of old,
Proclaiming in language divine,
The wonderful, wonderful message of truth,
That “they that be wise shall shine."

Overcoming evil day by day,
This our warfare on the Christian way;
Yet unto those that faithful endure,
God has declared that His promise is sure.

They that traffic on the sea,
While unceasing watch they keep,
See Jehovah’s majesty
And His wonders in the deep;
For He bids the storm-wind fly,
Lifting ocean’s waves on high.

They were in an upper chamber,
They were all with one accord,
When the Holy Ghost descended
As was promised by the Lord.

They were no better than I 
I am no worse than they 
If I will sacrifice, the Word of God obey
The Lord will deal with me
Just as He dealt with them
Then I will shout and say:
“God is the same today!"
Even by his shadow 
Peter healed the sick
And Paul by his aprons, made demons flee
The Lord Jesus said: “If you only believe 
You’ll do great things greater even than these"

They who seek the throne of grace,
Find that throne in every place;
If we live a life of prayer,
God is present everywhere.

They who tread the path of labor follow where my feet have trod; 
they who work without complaining, do the holy will of God; 
nevermore thou needest seek me; I am with thee everywhere; 
raise the stone, and thou shalt find me, cleave the wood and I am there.
Where the many toil together, there am I among my own; 
where the tired workman sleepeth, there am I with him alone: 
I, the Peace that passeth knowledge, dwell amid the daily strife; 
I, the Bread of heaven am broken in the sacrament of life.
Every task, however simple, sets the soul that does it free; 
every deed of love and mercy, done to man is done to me.
nevermore thou needest seek me; I am with thee everywhere; 
raise the stone, and thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and I am there.

They whose course on earth is o’er
Think they of their brethren more?
They before the Throne who bow,
Feel they for their brethren now?

We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord 
We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord 
And we pray that all unity may one day be restored 
And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love 
They will know we are Christians by our love

There is a calm for ev’ry storm
We meet from day to day,
A hallowed peace that dwells within,
And smiles the clouds away.
The star of hope still brightly shines,
Though wild the breakers roar,
And in its beams the words we trace,
Life’s dream will soon be o’er.

This child we dedicate to Thee,
O God of grace and purity!
Shield it from sin and threatening wrong,
And let Thy love its life prolong.

Thine arm, O Lord, in days of old, was strong to heal and save;
It triumphed o’er disease and death, over darkness and the grave.
To Thee they went, the blind, the dumb, the palsied and the lame,
The leper with his tainted life, the sick with fevered frame.

Thine be the glory, risen, conquering Son;
endless is the victory, thou o'er death hast won;
angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
kept the folded grave clothes where thy body lay.

I have made my choice to follow Christ each day,
I am Thine for service, Lord;
Tho’ I sometimes falter on the thorny way,
I am Thine for service, Lord.

Thine forever! God of love,
Hear us from Thy throne above;
Thine forever may we be
Here and in eternity.

Thine honor save, O Christ, our Lord!
Hear Zion’s cries and help afford;
Destroy the wiles of mighty foes
Who now Thy Word and truth oppose.

Thine is the glory, risen, conqu’ring Son;
[

Thine, Lord, is wisdom, Thine alone;
Justice and truth before Thee stand:
Yet, nearer to Thy sacred throne,
Mercy withholds Thy lifted hand.

Think gently of the erring one;
O let us not forget,
However darkly stained by sin,
He is our brother yet!

Thirty years among us dwelling,
his appointed time fulfilled,
born for this, he meets his passion,
for that this he freely willed:
on the Cross the Lamb is lifted,
where his life-blood shall be spilled.
He endured the nails, the spitting,
vinegar and spear and reed;
from that holy body piercŠd
blood and water forth proceed;
earth and stars and sky and ocean
by that flood from stain are freed.
Faithful Cross! above all other,
one and only noble tree!
None in foliage, none in blossom,
none in fruit thy peers may be;
sweetest wood and sweetest Iron!
sweetest weight is hung on thee.
Bend thy boughs, O tree of glory!
thy too rigid sinews bend;
for awhile the ancient rigor
that thy birth bestowed, suspend;
and the King of heavenly beauty
on thy bosom gently tend!
Thou alone wast counted worthy
this world's ransom to uphold;
for a shipwrecked race preparing
harbor, like the ark of old;
with the sacred blood anointed
from the smitten Lamb that rolled.
To the Trinity be glory
everlasting, as is meet:
equal to the Father, equal
to the Son and Paraclete:
Trinal Unity, whose praises
all created things repeat.

On Passover our Lord prepared to,
With His beloved twelve, His last supper share.
To comfort, and to heal them by His love,
He gave His Body and He gave His Blood.
He gave them freedom and He gave them life.
This by His Love!

This child we dedicate to Thee,
O God of grace and purity!
Shield it from sin and threatening wrong,
And let Thy love its life prolong.

This day in Jesus’ Name we meet,
Our Lord, Redeemer, King;
This day around Thy mercy seat
We all Thy praises sing;
Thou gavest us this day of rest,
Of holiness divine;
Lend comfort to each troubled breast,
And make us ever Thine.

This day at Thy creating Word
First o’er the earth the light was poured:
O Lord, this day upon us shine
And fill our souls with light divine.

This day in Jesus’ Name we meet,
Our Lord, Redeemer, King;
This day around Thy mercy seat
We all Thy praises sing;
Thou gavest us this day of rest,
Of holiness divine;
Lend comfort to each troubled breast,
And make us ever Thine.

This day the first of days was made,
When God in light the world arrayed;
Or when His Word arose again,
And, conquering death, gave life to men.

This endris night

This is Jesus’ precious Bible,
This the gift of God’s right hand;
Teaching how to die triumphant,
How to live His pure command;
This reveals the loss we suffered
When in Eden sin enticed;
And it shows the way to glory
If we follow Jesus Christ.

This is my Father’s world, and to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres.
This is my Father’s world: I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the wonders wrought.

This is my song, Oh God of all the nations,
A song of peace for lands afar and mine.
This is my home, the country where my heart is;
Here are my hopes, my dreams, my sacred shrine.
But other hearts in other lands are beating,
With hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.

Lonely hearts to comfort,
Weary lives to cheer—
This is our endeavor,
This our mission here;
Seeking out the lost ones
On the mountains cold,
We would gladly bring them
To the Shepherd’s fold.

This is the day
That the lord has made
We will rejoice
And be glad in it
This is the day that the lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it…
Take and receive
Take and receive O lord my liberty
Take all my will my mind my memory
Do thou direct and govern all and sway
Do what thou wilt, command and I obey
Only thy grace and love on me bestow
Possessing these all riches I forego
All things I hold and all I own are thine
Thine was the gift to thee I all resign
Do thou direct and govern all and sway
Do what thou wilt, command and I obey

This is the day of light:
Let there be light today;
O Dayspring, rise upon our night
And chase its gloom away.

This is the day the Lord hath made;
He calls the hours His own;
Let Heav’n rejoice, let earth be glad,
And praise surround the throne.

This is the Feast of Heav'nly Wine
And God invites to sup;
The juices of the living Vine
Were pressed to fill the cup.
O bless the Savior, ye that eat,
With royal dainties fed;
Not heav'n affords a costlier treat,
For Jesus is the bread.
The vile, the lost, he calls to them,
Ye trembling souls appear!
The righteous in their own esteem
Have no acceptance here.
Approach, ye poor, nor dare refuse
The banquet spread for you;
Dear Savior, this is welcome news,
Then I may venture too.
If guilt and sin afford a plea,
And may obtain a place,
Surely the Lord will welcome me,
And I shall see His face.

This is the field, the world below,
In which the sowers came to sow,
Jesus the wheat, Satan the tares,
For so the word of truth declares:
And soon the reaping time will come,
And angels shout the harvest home.

This is the hour of banquet and of song;
this is the heavenly table spread for me;
here let me feast, and feasting, still prolong
the hallowed hour of fellowship with thee.
Too soon we rise; we go our several ways;
the feast, though not the love, is past and gone,
the bread and wine consumed: yet all our days
thou still art here with us, our shield and sun.
Feast after feast thus comes and passes by;
yet, passing, points to the glad feast above,
giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,
the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.

This is the night, dear friends, the night for weeping,
when powers of darkness overcome the day,
the night the faithful mourn the weight of evil
whereby our sins the Son of Man betray.
This night the traitor, wolf within the sheepfold,
betrays himself into his victim's will;
the Lamb of God for sacrifice preparing,
sin brings about the cure for sin's own ill.
This night Christ institutes his holy supper,
blest food and drink for heart and soul and mind;
this night injustice joins its hand to treason's,
and buys the ransom-price of humankind.
This night the Lord by slaves shall be arrested,
he who destroys our slavery to sin;
accused of crime, to criminals be given,
that judgment on the righteous Judge begin.
O make us sharers, Savior, of your passion,
that we may share your glory that shall be;
let us pass through these three dark nights of sorrow
to Easter's laughter and its liberty.

March to the battlefield, march on with sword and shield;
March on; the foe shall yield to Christ our King.
Onward, ye faithful band, onward at His command;
Onward, nor halting stand, but loudly sing.

This joyful Easter-tide,
Away with care and sorrow!
My Love, the Crucified,
Hath sprung to life this morrow.

We find many people who can’t understand
Why we are so happy and free.
We’ve crossed over Jordan to Canaan’s fair land,
And this is like Heaven to me.

What I am, Thine eye can see,
Yet I come, O Lord, to Thee.
Though my sins are crimson red,
Yet for me Thy blood was shed.

This night a wondrous revelation
Makes known to me God’s love and grace;
The Child that merits adoration
Brings light to our benighted race;
And though a thousand suns did shine,
Still brighter were that Light divine.

This night, O Lord, we bless Thee
For Thy protecting care,
And, ere we rest, address Thee
In lowly, fervent prayer:
From evil and temptation
Defend us through the night,
And round our habitation
Be Thou a wall of light.

This spacious earth is all the Lord’s,
And men, and worms, and beasts, and birds:
He raised the building on the seas,
And gave it for their dwelling place.

This stone to thee in faith we lay;
We build the temple, Lord, to thee:
Thine eye be open, night and day,
To guard this house and sanctuary.
Here, when thy people seek thy face,
And dying sinners pray to live,
Hear thou in heaven, thy dwelling-place,
And when thou hearest, O forgive!
Here, when thy messengers proclaim
The blessed gospel of thy Son,
Still, by the power of his great name,
Be mighty signs and wonders done.
But will the Eternal Father deign
Here to abide, no transient guest?
Will here the world's Redeemer reign,
And here the Holy Spirit rest?
That glory never hence depart!
Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone;
Thy kingdom come to every heart:
In all the world be thine the throne.

Those eternal bowers, man hath never trod,
Those unfading flowers round the throne of God:
Who may hope to gain them after weary fight?
Who at length attain them, clad in robes of white?

Thou art coming, O my Savior,
Thou art coming, O my King,
In Thy beauty all resplendent,
In Thy glory all transcendent;
Well may we rejoice and sing:
Coming! in the opening east
Herald brightness slowly swells;
Coming! O my glorious Priest,
Hear we not Thy golden bells?

Thou art gone up on high, to mansions in the 
skies;
And round Thy throne unceasingly the songs of 
praise arise;
But we are lingering here, with sin and care 
oppressed;
Lord, send Thy promised Comforter, and lead us to 
Thy rest.

My God, I love Thee not because
I hope for Heav'n thereby,
Nor because they who love Thee not
Must burn eternally.

Thou art my God, O God of grace,
And earnestly I seek Thy face,
My heart cries out for Thee;
My spirit thirsts Thy grace to taste,
An exile in this desert waste
In which no waters be,
In which no waters be.

Thou art my hiding place, O Lord,
In Thee I put my trust;
Encouraged by Thy holy Word,
A feeble child of dust;
I have no argument beside,
I urge no other plea;
And ’tis enough my Savior died,
My Savior died for me.

Thou art my portion, Lord;
Thy words I ever heed;
With all my heart, Thy grace I seek,
Thy promises I plead.

Thou art my Rock in the wide desert land,
Sheltered by Thee here in safety I stand;
What tho’ the storms and the tempests may beat,
What tho’ the sun pour its fierce noontide heat:

Thou art my Shepherd,
Caring in every need,
Thy loving lamb to feed,
Trusting Thee still.
In the green pastures low,
Where living waters flow,
Safe by Thy side I go,
Fearing no ill.

“Thou art the Christ, O Lord,
The Son of God most high!"
For ever be adored
That Name in earth and sky,
In which, though mortal strength may fail,
The saints of God at last prevail!

Thou art the everlasting Word,
The Father’s only Son;
God manifestly seen and heard,
And Heav’n’s beloved one:

Thou art the mighty King of kings,
The Lord of lords most high:
Israel is safe beneath Thy wings;
Thy servant shall not die.
Through Thee we shall the victory gain,
Though hosts of hell oppose:
Thou art our God; and Thou wilt reign,
And conquer all our foes.

Thou art the Way: to Thee alone
From sin and death we flee;
And he who would the Father seek
Must seek Him, Lord, by Thee.

Thou art, O God, the God of might;
Thy power is never failing;
Thou safely leadest in the fight,
’Gainst every foe prevailing.

Thou art, O God, the Life and Light
Of all this wondrous world we see;
Its glow by day, its smile by night,
Are but reflections caught from Thee;
Where’er we turn, Thy glories shine,
And all things fair and bright are Thine.

Thou dear Redeemer, dying Lamb,
I love to hear of Thee;
No music like Thy charming Name,
Is half so sweet to me,
Is half so sweet to me.

Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem’s home was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity.

Thou didst teach the thronging people
By blue Galilee;
Speak to us, Thy erring children,
Teach us purity.

Thou fairest Child divine,
In yonder manger laid,
In Whom is God Himself well pleased,
By Whom all things were made,
On me art Thou bestowed,
How can such wonders be!
The dearest that the Father hath
He gives me here in Thee!

Thou glorious God, before Whose face
The generations pass away,
As, to our eyes, the tender grace
And marvel of each shining day!

Thou God of all, Whose spirit moves
From pole to silent pole,
Whose purpose binds the starry spheres
In one stupendous whole,
Whose life, like light, is freely poured
On all beneath the sun,
To Thee we lift our hearts, and pray
That Thou wilt make us one.

Thou God of glorious majesty,
To Thee, against myself, to Thee,
A worm of earth, I cry;
A half-awakened child of man;
An heir of endless bliss or pain;
A sinner born to die!

Thou God of power and God of love,
Whose glory fills the realms above,
Whose praise archangels sing,
And veil their faces while they cry,
 “Thrice holy," to their God most high,
 “Thrice holy," to their King.

Thou God of truth and love,
We seek thy perfect way,
Ready thy choice to approve,
Thy providence to obey;
Enter into thy wise design,
And sweetly lose our will in thine.
Why hast thou cast our lot
In the same age and place,
And why together brought
To see each other's face,
To join with loving sympathy,
And mix our friendly souls in thee?
Didst thou not make us one,
That we might one remain,
Together travel on,
And share our joy and pain,
Till all thy utmost goodness prove,
And rise renewed in perfect love?
Then let us ever bear
The blessed end in view,
And join, with mutual care,
To fight our passage through;
And kindly help each other on,
Till all receive the starry crown.
O may thy Spirit seal
Our souls unto that day,
With all thy fullness fill,
And then transport away:
Away to our eternal rest,
Away to our Redeemer's breast.

Thou grace divine, encircling all,
A soundless, shoreless sea!
Wherein at last our souls must fall
O love of God most free!

Thou gracious God, whose mercy lends
the light of home, the smile of friends,
our gathered flock thine arms enfold
as in the peaceful days of old.
Wilt thou not hear us while we raise
in sweet accord of solemn praise
the voices that have mingled long
in joyous flow of mirth and song?
For all the blessings life has brought,
for all its sorrowing hours have taught,
for all we mourn, for all we keep,
the hands we clasp, the loved that sleep.
The noontide sunshine of the past,
these brief, bright moments fading fast,
the stars that gild our darkening years,
the twilight ray from holier spheres.
We thank thee, Father; let thy grace
our loving circle still embrace,
thy mercy shed its heavenly store,
thy peace be with us evermore.

Thou gracious Power, whose mercy lends
The light of home, the smile of friends,
Our families in Thine arms enfold
As in the peaceful days of old.

Thou great mysterious God unknown,
Whose love hath gently led me on,
E’en from my infant days,
Mine inmost soul expose to view,
And tell me if I ever knew
Thy justifying grace,
Thy justifying grace.

Thou hallowed chosen morn of praise,
That best and greatest shinest;
Fair Easter, queen of all the days,
Of seasons, best, divinest!
Christ rose from death; and we adore
Forever and forevermore.

Thou hast been our Guide this day,
Thou hast led us all the way,
Thou hast been our Sun and Shield,
Grateful hearts to Thee we yield
While Thou art nigh.

Thou hast said, exalted Jesus,
 “Take thy cross and follow Me";
Shall the word with terror seize us?
Shall we from the burden flee?
Lord, I’ll take it, Lord, I’ll take it,
And rejoicing, follow Thee.

Thou hast stood here, Lord Jesus,
Beside the still cold grave;
And proved Thy deep compassion
And mighty power to save.
Thy tears of tender pity,
Thine agonizing groan,
Teach how for us Thou feelest,
Now seated on Thy throne.

Thou hidden Love of God, whose height,
Whose depth unfathomed no one knows,
I see from afar Thy beauteous light,
And inly sigh for Thy repose;
My heart is pained, nor can it be
At rest, till it finds rest in Thee.

Thou hidden source of calm repose,
Thou all sufficient love divine,
My help and refuge from my foes,
Secure I am if Thou art mine;
And lo! from sin and grief and shame
I hide me, Jesus, in Thy Name.

Thou, in whose Name the two or three
are met today to meet with thee,
fulfill to us thine own sure word,
and be thou here thyself, O Lord.
Today, our week, but now begun,
already half its course hath run;
to thee are known its toils and cares,
to thee its trials and its snares.
Thou by whose grace alone we live,
our oft-repeated sins forgive;
be thou our counsel, strength and stay,
through all the perils of our way.
Give thankful hearts thy gifts to share;
give steadfast wills thy cross to bear;
and when life's working days are past
give rest with all thy saints at last.

Thou Judge of quick and dead, before Whose bar severe,
With holy joy, or guilty dread, we all shall soon appear;
Our cautioned souls prepare for that tremendous day,
And fill us now with watchful care, and stir us up to pray.

Thou Judge of quick and dead,
before Whose bar severe,
With holy joy, or guilty dread,
we all shall soon appear;
Our cautioned souls prepare
for that tremendous day,
And fill us now with watchful care,
and stir us up to pray.

Thou knowest, Lord, the weariness and sorrow
Of the sad heart that comes to Thee for rest;
Cares of today, and burdens for tomorrow,
Blessings implored, and sins to be confessed;
I come before Thee at Thy gracious word,
And lay them at Thy feet: Thou knowest, Lord.

Thou Light of Gentile nations,
Thou Savior from above,
Drawn by Thy Spirit’s leading,
we come with joy and love
Into Thy holy temple and wait
with earnest mind
As Simeon once had waited His
God and Lord to find.

Thou, Lord, by strictest search hast known
My rising up and lying down;
My secret thoughts are known to Thee,
Known long before conceived by me.

Thou, Lord, hast dealt well with Thy servant,
Thy promise is faithful and just;
Instruct me in judgment and knowledge,
For in Thy commandments I trust.

Thou, Lord, hast power to heal,
And Thou wilt quickly aid,
For Thou dost deeply feel
The stripes upon us laid:
Thou who wast wounded by the rod
Uplifted in the hand of God.

Thou, Lord, hast power to heal,
And Thou wilt quickly aid,
For Thou dost deeply feel
The stripes upon us laid:
Thou who wast wounded by the rod
Uplifted in the hand of God.

Thou Lord of hosts, Whose guiding hand
Has brought us here before Thy face,
Our spirits wait for Thy command,
Our silent hearts implore Thy peace.

Thou Lord, art love, and everywhere
Thy Name is brightly shown;
Beneath, on earth—Thy footstool fair;
Above, in heaven—Thy throne.

Thou lovely Source of true delight,
Whom I unseen adore;
Unveil Thy beauties to my sight,
That I may love Thee more.

Though mighty foes assail me, Lord,
I fear not them, but Thee;
As boundless wealth and priceless spoil,
Thy Word rejoices me.
Deceit and falsehood I abhor,
But in Thy law delight;
Throughout the day I praise Thy Name,
For all Thy ways are right.

Thou my everlasting Portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior, let me walk with Thee.

Thou only Sovereign of my heart,
My Refuge, my almighty Friend—
And can my soul from Thee depart,
On Whom alone my hopes depend?

Thou remainest, blest Redeemer,
Lord of peace and Lord of strife,
Jesus, Savior, Lord forever,
Thou remainest, Christ, my life.

Thou shalt, O Lord, descend,
And all the kingdoms bless;
Throughout the earth Thy realm extend,
And judge in righteousness.

Thou Shepherd of Israel, and mine,
The joy and desire of my heart,
For closer communion I pine,
I long to reside where thou art:
The pasture I languish to find
There all, who their Shepherd obey,
Are fed, on thy bosom reclined,
And screened from the heat of the day.
Ah! show me that happiest place,
The place of thy people's abode,
Where saints in an ecstasy gaze,
And hang on a crucified God;
Thy love for a sinner declare,
Thy passion and death on the tree;
My spirit to Calvary bear,
To suffer and triumph with thee.
'Tis there, with the lambs of thy flock,
There only, I covet to rest,
To lie at the foot of the rock,
Or rise to be hid in thy breast;
'Tis there I would always abide,
And never a moment depart,
Concealed in the cleft of thy side,
Eternally held in thy heart.

Thou Son of God, Whose flaming eyes
Our inmost thoughts perceive,
Accept the grateful sacrifice
Which now to Thee we give.

Thou spakest, Lord, and into one
The floods together flowed;
Freed from its watery veil, the land
Its verdant pastures showed.

Thou tender, gracious Father,
Who watches over me,
How shall I ever praise Thee,
How love and honor Thee?
Thou guidest me with caution
From every secret snare,
And ’neath Thy wings a refuge
I find in my despair.

Thou to Whom the sick and dying
Ever came, nor came in vain,
Still with healing word replying,
To the wearied cry of pain,
Hear us, Jesu, as we meet
Suppliants at Thy mercy seat.

Thou, true and only God, lead’st forth
Th’immortal armies of the sky;
Thou laugh’st to scorn the gods of earth,
Thou thunderest, and amazed they fly.

Thou virgin-born incarnate Word,
Begotten of the Father,
Blest Son of Mary, David’s Lord,
In Thy dear Name we gather.
As Thou hast promised, be Thou nigh,
And hear us as we testify,
 “Thou art the Christ, our Savior."

Thou, Who didst call Thy saints of old
Thy chosen flock to teach,
Who mad’st the fearful hearted bold,
And quick the slow of speech;
Still Thou dost ask whom Thou shalt send
And who will go for Thee,
To feed Thy lambs, Thy sheep to tend;
 “Lord, here am I; send me."

Thou who the night in prayer didst spend
And then didst Thine apostles send
And bidd'st us pray the harvest's Lord
To send forth sowers of Thy Word,
Hear and Thy chosen servants bless
With sev'nfold gifts of holiness.

Thou will keep him in perfect peace (Whose mind is stayed on Thee.
Marvel not that I say unto you (Ye must be born again.
Though your sins as scarlet be (They shall be white as snow.
If the Son shall make you free (Ye shall be free indeed.
They that wait upon the Lord (They shall renew their strength.
Whom shall I send and who will go? (Here I am Lord, send me.

I want no other hand, O Lord,
But Thine my guide to be,
For well I know through all my life
Thou wilt remember me.

Thou Wind of God, whose coming stirred
A world as yet unmade,
And things, which were not, woke and heard
And answered and obeyed;
By thee the lives that live and move
In earth and sea began,
And human thought and human love
Lit up the heart of man;
Until thou camest, Holy One,
In Jesus' heart to dwell,
That man, in him, might be a son
And please the Father well.
O thou, who from the Father art,
Upon our Spirits move,
Until the children's thankful heart
Reflects the Father's love.

Thou, Lord, by strictest search hast known
My rising up and lying down;
My secret thoughts are known to Thee,
Known long before conceived by me.

Thou, Lord, hast dealt well with Thy servant,
Thy promise is faithful and just;
Instruct me in judgment and knowledge,
For in Thy commandments I trust.

Thou, O Lord, art God alone,
Everlasting is Thy throne;
Through the ages men shall sing
Praise of Heav’n’s eternal King.
Thou, enthroned above the skies,
Wilt for Zion’s help arise:
Let Thy grace to her appear,
For the promised time is near.

Thou, the Christ forever one,
Mary’s Child and Israel’s God,
Daniel’s Prince and David’s Son,
Jacob’s Star and Jesse’s Rod,
Thou of Whom of the prophets spake,
Thou in Whom their words came true,
Hear the pleading prayer we make,
Hear the Gentile for the Jew!

Thou, Who at Thy first Eucharist didst pray
That all Thy Church might be forever one,
Grant us that ev’ry Eucharist to say
With longing heart and soul,  “Thy will be done."
O may we all one bread, one body be,
Through this blest sacrament of unity.

Thou, Who didst call Thy saints of old
Thy chosen flock to teach,
Who mad’st the fearful hearted bold,
And quick the slow of speech;
Still Thou dost ask whom Thou shalt send
And who will go for Thee,
To feed Thy lambs, Thy sheep to tend;
 “Lord, here am I; send me."

Thou, Who didst make and fashion me,
O make me wise Thy law to learn;
Then they that fear Thee shall be glad
When they my hope in God discern.

Thou Who roll’st the year around,
Crowned with mercies large and free,
Rich Thy gifts to us abound;
Warm our praise shall rise to Thee.

Thou Who sentest Thine apostles
Two and two before Thy face,
Partners in the night of toiling,
Heirs together of Thy grace,
Throned at length, their labors ended,
Each in his appointed place.

Thou Who Thyself didst sanctify,
And set Thyself apart,
Thy servant’s purpose ratify,
The purpose of his heart.

Thou Whom my soul admires above
All earthly joy and earthly love,
Tell me, dear Shepherd, let me know,
Where do Thy sweetest pastures grow?

Thou, Whose almighty Word
 [

Thou, Whose unmeasured temple stands,
Built over earth and sea,
Accept these walls that human hands
Have raised, O God, to Thee.

Though I am poor and sorrowful,
Hear Thou, O God, my cry;
Let Thy salvation come to me
And lift me up on high.

Though I speak in every language,
Prophesy for God above,
Though I understand all mysteries,
I am nothing without love.
Though through faith I can move mountains,
Give the poor all that I gain,
Though I’m burned alive for Jesus,
Without love, my life is vain.

Though kindred ties around us
Like ivy branches twine,
Though life has many pleasures
That o’er my pathway shine,
Though words to friendship sacred
More sweet than music fall,
One look, one smile from Jesus
Is dearer far than all.

Though lowly here our lot may be,
High work have we to do,
In faith and trust to follow Him
Whose lot was lowly, too.

Though the fig tree shall not blossom,
Neither fruit be in the vine:
Though in vain the olive labors,
And the fruitful fields decline:

Though troubles assail,
And dangers affright;
Though friends should all fail,
And foes all unite,
Yet one thing secures us,
Whatever betide:
The Scripture assures us,
"The Lord will provide."

Though troubles assail us and dangers affright,
Though friends should all fail us and foes all unite,
Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide,
The promise assures us, “The Lord will provide."

“Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Though they be red like crimson,
They shall be as wool!"
 “Though your sins be as scarlet,
Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow,
They shall be as white as snow."

Three in One and One in Three,
Ruler of the earth and sea,
Hear us, while we lift to Thee
Holy chant and psalm.

Thrice happy souls, who, born from Heav’n,
While yet they sojourn here,
Humbly begin their days with God,
And spend them in His fear,
And spend them in His fear.

Thrice-holy Name! that sweeter sounds
Than streams which down the valley run,
And tells of more than human love,
And more than human power, in one:
First from the gracious herald heard,
Heard since through all the choirs on high;
O Child of Mary, Son of God,
Eternal, hear Thy children’s cry!
While at the blessed Name we bow,
Lord Jesus, be among us now!

Thro’ the new Heav’n what voices ring
In praise triumphant to our King?
Like many waters, hark, they pour
Their tide along the golden shore!
 “All blessing, honor, power divine,
All might and majesty be Thine!
Holy and true are all Thy words,
Thou King of kings and Lord of lords!"

O the wondrous story of a Savior’s love,
Coming from a throne to Calvary;
Leaving all the glories of that home above,
Died to save and set a lost world free.

Throned upon the awful tree,
Lamb of God, Your grief I see.
Darkness veils Your anguished face;
None its lines of woe can trace.
None can tell what pangs unknown
Hold You silent and alone.

Through all our days we'll sing the praise
of Christ, the resurrected;
who, though divine, did not decline
to be by men afflicted:
pain, pain and suffering
he knew its taste, he bore its sting;
peace, peace has come to earth
through Christ our King and Savior.
His birth obscure, his family poor,
he owned no crown, no kingdom;
yet those who grieve in fear, believe
since he brought light and freedom:
shame, shame and agony
though guiltless he of felony;
shout, shout his sinless name,
our Jesus, King and Savior.
At fearful cost his life he lost
that death might be defeated;
the Man of Love, now risen above,
in majesty is seated:
low, low was his descent
to those by sin and sorrow bent;
life, life to all who trust
the Lord, our King and Savior.
And all who trust will find they must
obey the will of heaven;
for grief intense can make some sense
to those who are forgiven:
hard, hard the road he trod
the Son of Man, the Son of God;
hope, hope in Christ alone,
our reigning King and Savior.

Through all the changing scenes of life,
In trouble and in joy,
The praises of my God shall still
My heart and tongue employ.

Through all the years, may Israel say,
My bitter foes have oft assailed,
Have sought my hurt in fierce array,
Yet over me have not prevailed.

Through every age, eternal God,
Thou art our rest, our safe abode;
High was Thy throne ere Heav’n was made,
Or earth Thy humble footstool laid.

Through good report and evil, Lord,
Still guided by Thy faithful Word,
Our staff, our buckler and our sword,
We follow Thee.

Through Jesus' blood and merit
I am at peace with God;
What, then, can daunt my spirit,
However dark my road?
My courage shall not fail me,
For God is on my side;
Though hell itself assail me,
Its rage I may deride.

Through midnight gloom from Macedon
The cry of myriads as of one,
The voiceful silence of despair,
Is eloquent in awful prayer,
The soul’s exceeding bitter cry,
“Come o’er and help us, or we die."

Through the ages saints have wondered
When the promised day will be,
When in power and brightest glory
Our returning Lord we’ll see;
Searching the Scripture for signs of the times:
Plague, earthquake, famine, false Christs and shrines;
War and commotion, and signs in the sky;
So lift up your heads, redemption then is nigh!

Through the love of God our Savior,
All will be well;
Free and changeless is His favor;
All, all is well.
Precious is the blood that healed us;
Perfect is the grace that sealed us;
Strong the hand stretched out to shield us;
All must be well.

Through the night of doubt and sorrow
Onward goes the pilgrim band,
Singing songs of expectation,
Marching to the promised land.
Clear before us through the darkness
Gleams and burns the guiding light:
Brother clasps the hand of brother,
Stepping fearless through the night.

Throw out the life line across the dark wave;
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody’s brother! O who then will dare
To throw out the life line, his peril to share?

Thus far the Lord hath led me on,
Thus far His power prolongs my days,
And every evening shall make known
Some fresh memorial of His grace.

Thus speaks the Lord to wicked men:
My statutes why do you declare?
Why take My covenant in your mouth,
Since ye for wisdom do not care?
For ye My holy words profane
And cast them from you in disdain.

Awake, O Christian, from thy sleep,
And heed thy brother’s call!
He cries to thee across the deep,
Where darkest shadows falls.
From sin and guilt and wretchedness
He knows not where to flee;
Go tell him how the Lord can bless!
Thy brother calls to thee.

Thy ceaseless, unexhausted love,
Unmerited and free,
Delights our evil to remove,
And help our misery.

Thy faithfulness, Lord, each moment we find,
So true to Thy Word, so loving and kind!
Thy mercy so tender to all the lost race,
The vilest offender may turn and find grace.

Trembling soul, beset by fears, “Thy God reigneth!"
Look above, and dry thy tears: “Thy God reigneth!"
Though thy foes with power assail, naught against thee shall prevail;
Trust in Him—He’ll never fail:
“Thy God reigneth, Thy God reigneth!"

Thy goodness, Lord, our souls confess,
Thy goodness we adore:
A spring, whose blessings never fail,
A sea without a shore.

I know Thy hand upholdeth me,
My Savior and my God;
And step by step I’ll follow Thee
Where’er Thy feet have trod.

Thy hand, O God, has guided
Thy flock from age to age;
The wondrous tale is written,
Full clear, on every page;
Our fathers owned Thy goodness,
And we their deeds record;
And both of this bear witness,
 “One Church, one Faith, one Lord."

Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone,
Can turn our hearts from sin;
His power alone can sanctify
And keep us pure within.

Thy kingdom come! and shall not each one sing it,
On land and sea, where’er His banner goes?
Thy kingdom come! shall we not strive to bring it,
The grace that saves the world from human woes?

Thy kingdom come! on bended knee
The passing ages pray;
And faithful souls have yearned to see
On earth that kingdom’s day.

Thy kingdom come! O Father, hear our prayer;
Shine through the clouds that darken everywhere;
Thou only light, Thou only life and joy,
Show us the hope that nothing can destroy.

Thy Kingdom come, O God,
Thy rule, O Christ, begin;
Break with Thine iron rod
The tyrannies of sin.

Thy life was given for me;
thy blood, O Lord, was shed,
that I might ransomed be,
and quickened from the dead.
Thy life was given for me;
what have I given for thee?
Long years were spent for me,
in weariness and woe,
that through eternity
thy glory I might know.
Long years were spent for me;
have I spent one for thee?
Thy Father's home of light,
thy rainbow-circled throne,
were left for earthly night,
for wanderings sad and lone.
Yea, all was left for me;
have I left aught for thee?
Thou, Lord, hast borne for me
more than my tongue can tell
of bitterest agony,
to rescue me from hell.
Thou sufferedst all for me;
what have I borne for thee?
And thou hast brought to me,
down from thy home above,
salvation full and free,
thy pardon and thy love.
Great gifts thou broughtest me;
what have I brought to thee?
O let my life be given,
my years for thee be spent,
world fetters all be riven,
and joy with suffering blent!
Thou gavest thyself for me;
I give myself to thee.

Thy little ones, dear Lord, are we,
And come Thy lowly bed to see;
Enlighten every soul and mind,
That we the way to Thee may find.

Thy lovingkindness, Lord, is good and free,
In tender mercy turn Thou unto me;
Hide not Thy face from me in my distress,
In mercy hear my prayer, Thy servant bless.

Thy mansion is the Christian’s heart,
O Lord, Thy dwelling-place secure!
Bid the unruly throng depart,
And leave the consecrated door.

Thy mercy and Thy truth, O Lord,
Transcend the lofty sky;
Thy judgments are a mighty deep,
And as the mountains high.

Thy mercy, My God, is the theme of my song
The joy of my heart, and boast of my tongue
Thy free grace alone, from the first to the last,
Hath won my affections and bound my soul fast.
Without thy sweet mercy I could not live here,
Sin soon would reduce me to utter despair;
But, through thy free goodness, my spirits revive
And he that first made me, still keeps me alive.
Thy mercy is more than a match for my heart,
Which wonders to feel its own hardness depart;
Dissolved by thy goodness, I fall to the ground,
And weep to the praise of the mercy I found.
The door of thy mercy stands open all day
To the door and the need who knock by the way;
No sinner shall ever be empty sent back,
Who comes seeking mercy for Jesus' sake.
Thy mercy is Jesus exempts me from hell;
Its glories I'll sing, and its wonders I'll tell;
'Twas Jesus my all, as he hung on the tree,
Who opened the channel of mercy for me.
Great Father of mercies, thy goodness I own,
And the cov'nant love of thy crucified Son;
All praise to the Spirit whose whisper divine,
Seals mercy and pardon and righteousness mine!

Thy might sets fast the mountains; strength girds Thee
evermore
To calm the raging peoples and still the ocean’s roar.
Thy majesty and greatness are through all lands confessed,
And joy on earth Thou sendest afar, from east to west.

Thy presence, gracious God, afford;
Prepare us to receive Thy Word:
Now let Thy voice engage our ear,
And faith be mixed with what we hear.

Thy promised mercies send to me,
Thy great salvation, Lord;
So shall I answer those who scoff:
My trust is Thy Word.

Thy servant, blessed by Thee, shall live
And keep Thy Word with awe;
Lord open Thou mine eyes to see
The wonders of Thy law.

Thy table I approach,
Dear Savior, hear my prayer;
Oh, let no unrepented sin
Prove hurtful to me there!

Thy tender mercies, O my Lord,
Withhold not, I implore;
But let Thy kindness and Thy truth
Preserve me evermore.
For countless ills have compassed me,
My sinful deeds arise;
Yea, they have overtaken me;
I dare not raise my eyes.

Thy way and all thy sorrows,
Give thou into His hand,
His gracious care unfailing,
Who doth the heav’ns command.
Their course and path He giveth
To clouds and air and wind;
A way thy feet may follow,
He too for thee will find.

Thy way, not mine, O Lord,
However dark it be;
Lead me by Thine own hand,
Choose out the path for me.

Thy ways, O Lord! with wise design,
Are framed upon thy throne above,
And ev'ry dark and bending line
Meets in the center of thy love.
With feeble light, and half obscure,
Poor mortals thy arrangements view,
Not knowing that the least is sure,
And the mysterious just and true.
Thy flock, thy own peculiar care,
Though now they seem to roam uneyed.
Are led or driven only where
They best and safest may abide.
They neither know nor trace the way,
But trusting to thy piercing eye,
None of their feet to ruin stray,
Nor shall the weakest fail or die.
My favored soul shall meekly learn
To lay her reason at thy throne;
Too weak thy secrets to discern,
I'll trust thee for my guide alone.

Thy ways, O Lord, with wise design
Are framed upon Thy throne above,
And every dark and bending line
Meets in the center of Thy love.

Out of earth’s heart breaking sorrow and anguish
Into eternity’s rapture and calm;
Out of the doubts and the fears where we languish
Into the triumph of victory’s psalm;
Gone is a leader and friend of the people,
Home with the ransomed and numberless throngs,
There to receive the reward of his labors,
Who in the ranks of the martyrs belongs.
Whisper it tenderly sorrowing one,
This was God’s way, His will ever be done.
This was God’s way, this was God’s way,
This was God’s way, His will ever be done.

Thy wondrous testimonies, Lord,
My soul will keep and greatly praise;
Thy Word, by faithful lips proclaimed,
To simplest minds the truth conveys.

Thy Word is a lamp to my feet,
A light to my path alway,
To guide and to save me from sin,
And show me the heav’nly way.

Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, O Lord,
Thy Word is a light to my way;
It shines in my soul like a star by night,
And comforts and cheers me by day.

Thy Word is like a garden, Lord,
with flowers bright and fair;
And every one who seeks may pluck
a lovely cluster there.
Thy Word is like a deep, deep
mine; and jewels rich and rare
Are hidden in its mighty depths
for every searcher there.

Thy Word sheds light upon my path;
A shining light, it guides my feet;
Thy righteous judgments to observe
My solemn vow I now repeat.

Thy Word, O God, declareth
No man hath seen or heard
The joys our God prepareth
For them that love their Lord.
Their eyes shall see Thy glory,
Thy face, Thy throne, Thy might;
With shouts shall they adore Thee,
The true, eternal Light.

Thy Word, O Lord, Thy precious Word alone,
Can lead me on;
By this, until the darksome night be gone,
Lead Thou me on!
Thy Word is light, Thy Word is life and power;
By it, oh, guide me in each trying hour.

Thy Word, O Lord, like gentle dews,
Falls soft on hearts that pine;
Lord, to Thy garden ne’er refuse
This heavenly balm of Thine.
Watered by Thee, let every tree
Then blossom to Thy praise,
By grace of Thine bear fruit divine
Through all the coming days.

Thy works, not mine, O Christ, speak gladness to this heart;
They tell me all is done; they bid my fear depart.
To whom, save Thee, Who canst alone For sin atone, Lord, shall I flee?

“Till He come," O let the words
Linger on the trembling chords,
Let the “little while" between
In their golden light be seen;
Let us think how Heaven and home
Lie beyond that, “Till He come."

In the house of many mansions,
With its portals bright and fair,
I am laying up my treasures,
And my heart will soon be there.

I have made my choice to follow Christ each day,
I am Thine for service, Lord;
Tho’ I sometimes falter on the thorny way,
I am Thine for service, Lord.

Time like a fleeting shadow flies,
My house of clay must fall;
This tabernacle must decay
And vanish as a scrawl.
My youth and age, my months and years
Like grass and flow'rs decay;
Before the mower's scythe of death
They soon will pass away.
But far beyond death's gloomy vale
A heav'nly building stands;
Prolific streams of glory flow
In those celestial lands.
To that bright world, that house above,
My longing spirit soars,
Where God, my heavn'ly Father lives,
And ev'ry saint adores.
Then let this earthly mansion fall
And set my spirit free;
Why should I wish to stay below,
And stay so long from thee?
I'm but a pilgrim far from home,
While here on earth I stay;
My brightest moments are but night
Compared with endless day.
Then let me wait, and live by faith,
Till I am called away;
And to that brighter world ascend,
That house which can't decay.
Let all my fleeting moments pass;
Earth's painted toys may fade;
O, Jesus, my eternal life
Support me through the shade.
Then to that world of light and love,
Immortal and divine,
Bring this poor pilgrim from the tomb,
This trembling soul of mine.

Time, with an unwearied hand,
Pushes round the seasons past,
And in life’s frail glass, the sand
Sinks apace, not long to last:
Many, well as you or I,
Who last year assembled thus;
In their silent graves now lie,
Graves will open soon for us!

Time, by moments, steals away,
First the hour, and then the day;
Small the daily loss appears,
Yet it soon amounts to years:
Thus another year is flown,
Now it is no more our own
(If it brought or promised good)
Than the years before the flood.

Timeless love! We sing the story,
praise his wonders, tell his worth;
love more fair than heaven's glory,
love more firm than ancient earth!
Tell his faithfulness abroad:
who is like him? Praise the Lord!
By his faithfulness surrounded,
north and south his hand proclaim;
earth and heaven formed and founded,
skies and seas declare his Name!
Wind and storm obey his word:
who is like him? Praise the Lord!
Truth and righteousness enthrone him,
just and equal are his ways;
more than happy, those who own him, more than joy, their songs of praise!
Sun and Shield and great Reward:
who is like him? Praise the Lord!

'Tis a point I long to know,
Oft it causes anxious thought,
Do I love the Lrod, or no?
Am I his, or am I not?
If I love, why am I thus?
Why this dull and lifeless frame?
Hardly, sure, can they be worse
Who have never heard his name.
When I turn my eyes within,
All is dark, and vain, and wild;
Filled with unbelief and sin,
Can I deem myself a child?
If I pray, or near, or read,
Sin is mixed with all I do,
You that love the Lord indeed,
a Tell me, is it thus with you?
Could I joy his saints to meet,
Choose the ways I once abhorred,
Find at times the promise sweet,
If I did not love the Lord?
Lord, decide the doubtful case,
Thou who are thy people's sun,
Shine upon the work of grace,
If it be indeed begun.
Let me love thee more and more,
If I love at all, I pray;
If I have not loved before,
Help me to begin to-day.

’Tis almost time for the Lord to come,
I hear the people say;
The stars of heaven are growing dim,
It must be the breaking of the day.

God sent His mighty pow’r
To this poor, sinful heart,
To keep me ev’ry hour,
And needful grace impart;
And since His Spirit came,
To take supreme control,
The love enkindled flame
Is burning in my soul.

The bells are sweetly chiming,
Their music fills the air;
What message do they bring us
Upon this morning fair?
“’Tis Christmas day!" the glad bells say,

’Tis done! that new and heavenly birth,
Which re-creates the sons of earth,
Has cleansed from guilt of Adam’s sin
A soul which Jesus died to win.

’Tis finished! so the Savior cried,
And meekly bowed His head and died;
 ’Tis finished—yes, the race is run,
The battle fought, the victory won.

’Tis finished! The Messiah dies,
Cut off for sins, but not His own:
Accomplished is the sacrifice,
The great redeeming work is done.

’Tis for conquering kings to gain
Glory o’er their myriads slain;
Jesus, Thy more glorious strife
Hath restored a world to life.

’Tis good, Lord, to be here,
Thy glory fills the night;
Thy face and garments, like the sun,
Shine with unborrowed light.

'Tis Hard, When We Are Sick and Poor
And they who loved us love no more;
When riches, health, and friends are gone,
To say, "O Lord, thy will be done."
Yet Lord, I would to thee resign,"
And say, "My Father's will be mine."
'T is hard, when in our soul's distress,
All, all around is wilderness;
When herbs and quenching streams there's none,
To say, "My Father's will be done."
Yet, Lord, I would to thee resign,
And say, "My Father's will be mine."
And yet, how light our sorrows be
To His in dark Gethsemane,
Who drank the cup, with stifled groan,
And said, "My Fahter's will be done."
Dear Lord, my I to thee resign,
And say, "My Father's will be mine."

I know of a world that is sunk in shame,
Where hearts oft faint and tire;
But I know of a Name, a precious Name,
That can set that world on fire;
Its sound is sweet, its letters flame.

’Tis midnight, and on Olive’s brow
The star is dimmed that lately shone;
’Tis midnight, in the garden now
The suffering Savior prays alone.


’Tis not that I did choose Thee,
For Lord, that could not be;
This heart would still refuse Thee,
Hadst Thou not chosen me.
Thou from the sin that stained me
Hast cleansed and set me free;
Of old Thou hast ordained me,
That I should live to Thee.

’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
And to take Him at His Word;
Just to rest upon His promise,
And to know, “Thus says the Lord!"

I know in Whom my soul believes,
I know in Whom I trust;
The Holy One, the merciful,
The only wise and just.

’Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
What a balm for the weary, O how sweet to be there!

’Tis Thine alone, almighty Name,
To raise the dead to life,
The lost inebriate to reclaim
From passion’s fearful strife.

’Tis winter now; the fallen snow
Has left the heav’ns all coldly clear;
Through leafless boughs the sharp winds blow,
And all the earth lies dead and drear.

To a maid engaged to Joseph, the angel Gabriel came.
 “Fear not," the angel told her, “I come to bring good news,
Good news I come to tell you, good news, I say, good news.

To arms! To arms! ye soldiers,
The trumpet call obey!
Arise from dreary slumbers
To watch, and fight, and pray.

To bless the earth, God sendeth
From His abundant store
The waters of the springtime,
Enriching it once more.
The seed by Him provided
Is sown o’er hill and plain,
And with the gentle showers
Doth bless the springing grain.

To Canaan's land I'm on my way,
Where the soul of man never dies;
My darkest night will turn to day,
Where the soul of man never dies.

To Christ, the Prince of peace,
And Son of God most high,
The Father of the world to come,
We lift our joyful cry.

To God be the glory, great things He has done;
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the life gate that all may go in.

To God I cried with mournful voice,
I sought His gracious ear,
In the sad day when troubles rose,
And filled the night with fear.

To God my earnest voice I raise,
To God my voice imploring prays;
Before His face my grief I show
And tell my trouble and my woe.

To God the anthem raising,
Sing, Christians, great and small;
Sing out, His goodness praising,
Oh, thank Him, one and all!
Behold how God this year,
Which now is safely ended,
Hath in His love befriended
His children far and near.

To God, the great, the ever blest,
Let songs of honor be addressed;
His mercy firm forever stands
Give Him the thanks His love demands.

To God the only wise,
Our Savior and our King,
Let all the saints below the skies
Their humble praises bring.

To God will I direct my prayer,
And He will make my needs His care;
I trust Him still, though in my grief
No answer yet has brought relief;
With hands outstretched through all the night,
Uncomforted I sought for light.

To God, the great, the ever blest,
Let songs of honor be addressed;
His mercy firm forever stands
Give Him the thanks His love demands.

To God, the universal King,
Let all mankind their tribute bring;
All that have breath! your voices raise,
In songs of never ending praise.

To Him Who for our sins was slain,
To Him, for all His dying pain,
Sing we Alleluia! Sing we Alleluia!
To Him the Lamb, our Sacrifice,
Who gave His soul our ransom price,
Sing we Alleluia! Sing we Alleluia!

There’s a gentle voice within calls away,
 ’Tis a warning I have heard o’er and o’er,
But my heart is melted now, I obey;
From my Savior I will wander no more.

To Jordan came our Lord the Christ,
To do God’s pleasure willing,
And there was by Saint John baptized,
All righteousness fulfilling;
There did He consecrate a bath
To wash away transgression,
And quench the bitterness of death
By His own blood and passion;
He would a new life give us.

To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
all pray in their distress,
and to these virtues of delight
return their thankfulness.
For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
is God our Father dear;
and Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
is Man, his Child and care.
For Mercy has a human heart,
Pity, a human face,
and Love, the human form divine.
and Peace, the human dress.
Then every man, of every clime,
that prays in his distress,
prays to the human form divine,
Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
And all must love the human form,
in heathen, Turk or Jew;
where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,
there God is dwelling too.

To mock your reign, O dearest Lord,
they made a crown of thorns;
set you with taunts along that road
from which no one returns.
They did not know, as we do now,
that glorious is your crown;
that thorns would flower upon your brow,
your sorrows heal our own.
In mock acclaim, O gracious Lord,
they snatched a purple cloak,
your passion turned, for all they cared,
into a soldier's joke.
They did not know, as we do now,
that though we merit blame
you will your robe of mercy throw
around our naked shame.
A sceptered reed, O patient Lord,
they thrust into your hand,
and acted out their grim charade
to its appointed end.
They did not know, as we do now,
though empires rise and fall,
your Kingdom shall not cease to grow
till love embraces all.

To my humble supplication,
Lord, give ear and acceptation;
Save Thy servant, that hath none
Help nor hope but Thee alone.

To our Redeemer’s glorious Name
Awake the sacred song:
O may His love—immortal flame—
Tune every heart and tongue.

To realms beyond the sounding sea,
Thy hand has led our sons afar;
Lord, give them grace to live for Thee;
Be still their Shield and Guiding Star.

To realms of glory in the skies
I see my Lord returning,
While I, a stranger in the earth,
For heaven am ever yearning.
’Mid toil and sorrow here I roam,
Far from my heavenly Father’s home.

When Jesus was born in the manger
The shepherds came thither to see,
For the angels proclaimed that a Savior was born
To save a poor sinner like me.
To save a poor sinner,
To save a poor sinner,
To save a poor sinner like me.
For the angels proclaimed that a Savior was born
To save a poor sinner like me.

To shepherds as they watched by night
Appeared a host of angels bright;
Behold the tender Babe, they said,
In yonder lowly manger laid.

To the hills I lift mine eyes;
Whence shall help for me arise?
From the Lord shall come mine aid,
Who the Heav’n and earth has made.
He will guide through dangers all,
Will not suffer thee to fall;
He Who safe His people keeps
Slumbers not and never sleeps.

To Thee, O Lord, I lift mine eyes,
O Thou enthroned above the skies;
As servants watch their master’s hand,
Or maidens by their mistress stand;
So to the Lord our eyes we raise,
Until His mercy He displays.

To Thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise in hymns of adoration,
To Thee bring sacrifice of praise with shouts of exultation.
Bright robes of gold the fields adorn, the hills with joy are ringing,
The valleys stand so thick with corn that even they are singing.

To the Name of our salvation,
Laud and honor let us pay,
Which for many a generation
Hid in God’s foreknowledge lay;
But with holy exultation
We may sing aloud today.

To the Name that is salvation,
Praise and homage let us pay;
Life of every generation,
Law that all the stars obey;
Love and light by Whose creation
All that is stands fast today.

To the work! To the work! We are servants of God;
Let us follow the path that our Master has trod;
With the balm of His counsel our strength to renew,
Let us do with our might what our hands find to do.

To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God,
We sing, we ever sing;
For He the lonely wine press trod,
Our cup of joy to bring.
His glorious arm the strife maintained,
He marched in might from far;
His robes were with the vintage stained,
Red with the wine of war.

To Thee, my God and Savior, my heart exulting sings,
Rejoicing in Thy favor, almighty King of kings.
I’ll celebrate Thy glory, with all Thy saints above,
And tell the joyful story of Thy redeeming love.

To Thee my heart I offer,
O Christ-child sweet and dear,
Upon Thy love relying;
Oh, be Thou ever near!
Take Thou my heart and give me Thine
And let it be forever mine,
O Jesus, holy, undefiled,
My Savior meek and mild.

To thee, O Father, lamp of all the living,
We offer now this life of thine own giving:
Humbly we pray thee, through this earth's endeavour
Light his steps ever.
Jesus, thyself a baby once from heaven,
To thee this little pilgrim here is given:
Within the mercy of thy fold befriend him;
Thy love attend him.
Spirit of Comfort, fountain ever welling,
This infant's heart take now to be thy dwelling;
So may he live, grace, pity, truth confessing,
Thy peace possessing.
Gather him, Holy Trinity, for ever
Into the wisdom of thy strength, that never
In life's dark shadow-lands thy love may leave him:
Thine own receive him.

To thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise in hymns of adoration,
to thee bring sacrifice of praise with shouts of exultation.
Bright robes of gold the fields adorn, the hills with joy are ringing,
the valleys stand so thick with corn that even they are singing.
And now, on this our festal day, thy bounteous hand confessing,
Upon thine altar, Lord, we lay the first fruits of thy blessing.
By thee the souls of men are fed
with gifts of grace supernal;
thou, who dost give us earthly bread, give us the bread eternal.
We bear the burden of the day, and often toil seems dreary;
but labor ends with sunset ray, and rest comes for the weary.
May we, the angel reaping over, stand at the last accepted,
Christ's golden sheaves, forevermore to garners bright elected.
O blessed is that land of God where saints abide forever,
where golden fields spread fair and broad, where flows the crystal river;
the strains of all its holy throng with ours today are blending;
thrice blessed is that harvest song which never hath an ending.

To Thee, O Savior Friend,
Our loving prayers ascend,
To Thee we sing.
Upon Thine altars here
Our choicest gifts appear,
And all we hold most dear
To Thee we bring.

To Thee our God we fly
For mercy and for grace;
O hear our lowly cry,
And hide not Thou Thy face.

To Thee, Eternal Soul, be praise!
Who, from of old to our own days,
Through souls of saints and prophets, Lord,
Hast sent Thy light, Thy love, Thy Word.

To Thee, my heart, eternal King,
Would now its thankful tribute bring;
To Thee its humble homage raise
In songs of ardent, grateful, praise.

To Thee, O Comforter divine,
For all Thy grace and power benign,
Sing we Alleluia!

To Thee, O dear, dear Savior!
My spirit turns for rest,
My peace is in Thy favor,
My pillow on Thy breast!
Though all the world deceive me,
I know that I am Thine,
And Thou wilt never leave me,
O blessed Savior mine.

To Thee, O God, the shepherd kings
Their earliest homage paid,
And wafted upon angel wings
Their worship was conveyed.

To Thee, O God, we render thanks,
To Thee give thanks sincere,
Because Thy wondrous works declare
That Thou art ever near.

To Thee, O God, Whose guiding hand
Our fathers led across the sea,
And brought them to this barren shore,
Where they might freely worship Thee—

To Thee, O Lord, I fly
And on Thy help depend;
Thou art my Lord and King most high;
Do Thou my soul defend.
A heritage for me
Jehovah will remain;
My portion rich and full is He,
My right He will maintain.

To Thee, O Lord, I lift mine eyes,
O Thou enthroned above the skies;
As servants watch their master’s hand,
Or maidens by their mistress stand;
So to the Lord our eyes we raise,
Until His mercy He displays.

To Thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise in hymns of adoration,
To Thee bring sacrifice of praise with shouts of exultation.
Bright robes of gold the fields adorn, the hills with joy are ringing,
The valleys stand so thick with corn that even they are singing.

To Thine eternal arms, O God,
Take us, Thine erring children, in;
From dangerous paths too boldly trod,
From wandering thoughts and dreams of sin.

To Thy pastures fair and large,
Heav’nly Shepherd, lead Thy charge,
And my couch with tend’rest care,
 ’Mid the springing grass prepare.

To Thy temple holy, come we now with praise;
Thou, the meek and lowly, guide us to Thy ways;
To Thy courts ascending, though unworthy we;
Let our worship, blending, swell Thy harmony.

To Thy temple I repair;
Lord, I love to worship there
When within the veil I meet
Christ before the mercy seat.

To us a Child of hope is born,
To us a Son is giv'n,
Him shall the tribes of earth obey,
Him all the hosts of Heav'n.

To us a Child of royal birth,
Heir of the promises, is given;
The Invisible appears on earth,
The Son of man, the God of Heaven.

With shield and banner waving bright,
The armies of the Lord
Are marching on, at His command,
To conquer thro’ His Word.

To weary shepherds sleeping,
A blinding light appeared;
And from their couches sleeping,
They scattered, all afeared;
But Gabriel spake to calm them
From all that did alarm them.

To whom can I go but to Jesus
When tempted to doubt and despair?
He only can heal my diseases,
He only will answer my prayer.

To you before the end of day,
Creator of the world, we pray:
In love unfailing hear our prayer,
Enfold us in your watchful care.
Keep all disturbing dreams away,
And hold the evil foe at bay;
Repose untroubled let us find
For soul and body, heart and mind.
Almighty Father, this accord
Through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord,
Who reigns with you eternally
In your blest Spirit's unity.Amen.

To You my Lord I cling You my Lord shelter me
Forever my Jesus.
I’ll love You
To You my Lord I cling You my Lord shelter me
Forever my Jesus.
I’ll follow You
Then I was born again
And could forever understand
There is a an Almighty God
The light of my life
My Jesus Christ 
To you was given, O saint beloved,
A vision of Christ's glory
Before he lived his earthly life
Begun with Christmas story:
The glory of the Son of God
Before the world's creation,
In whom all things that are were made
And have their consummation.
In you he found his closest friend,
A friend though frail and mortal,
Whose love so pure gave sight so sure
It pierced beyond heaven's portal:
So to the world you witness gave,
With prophet's eye descrying
The life of grace and fellowship,
The life in God undying.
O love of God that overflowed
In glories of creation!
O crowning glory of all life
In wondrous Incarnation!
All praise to God whose saint and seer
Declared the love excelling
Now shed abroad in faithful hearts,
Abounding and indwelling.

Today Thy mercy calls me to wash away my sin;
However great my trespass, whate’er I may have been;
However long from mercy I may have turned away,
Thy blood, O Christ, can cleanse me, and make me white today.

Today, O Lord, a holier work
Thy secret counsels frame,
A king to rule Thy new made world,
To praise Thy glorious Name.

Together, we gather here today
Together, Lord, we come to Thee,
And in Thy presence bow the head;
A band of hard-pressed folk are we,
Who find life’s pathway rough to tread.

The toil of brain, or heart, or hand,
Is man’s appointed lot;
He who God’s call can understand,
Will work and murmur not.
Toil is no thorny crown of pain,
Bound round man’s brow for sin;
True souls, from it, all strength may gain,
High manliness may win.

Tomorrow, Lord, is Thine
Lodged in Thy sovereign hand;
And if its sun arise and shine,
It shines by Thy command.

Too late? Ah, no, the pulse of life still throbs within thy breast;
And while that blessed spark remains, thy soul may find a rest.
The Lord in mercy spares thee yet, His love to thee is great;
But do not tempt that love too far, or it may be too late.

Too many, Lord, abuse Thy grace,
In this licentious day;
And while they boast they see Thy face,
They turn their own away.

Transfigured Christ, none comprehends
your majesty, whose splendor stuns
all waking souls; whose light transcends
the brightness of a thousand suns!
You stand with Moses on the hill,
you speak of your new exodus.
The way through death you will fulfill
by dying helpless on the cross.
You stand here with Elijah too,
by whom the still small voice was heard;
and you, yourself, will prove God true,
made mute in death, incarnate Word.
If we could bear your brightness here
and stay forever in your light,
then we would conquer grief and fear,
and scorn the terrors of the night.
But, from the heights, you bring us down
to share earth's agonies with you,
where piercing thorns are made your crown
and death, accepted, proves love true.
Majestic Christ, God's well-loved Son,
if we must share your grief and loss,
transfigure us, when all is done,
with glory shining from your cross.

Thro’ a land of sin and shame,
Led by Jesus we are trav’ling home;
Trusting in the Savior’s Name,
Led by Jesus we are trav’ling home.

Be silent, be silent,
A whisper is heard,
Be silent, and listen,
O treasure each word!

Our Father has planted a beautiful tree,
Whose evergreen branches His children behold;
They walk ’neath its shade in the City above,
Whose gates are of pearl and whose streets are of gold.

Trembling before Thine awful throne,
O Lord, in dust my sins I own;
Justice and mercy for my life
Contend; O smile, and heal the strife.

We are a band of merry children,
Full of glee, full of glee,
Like the springtime in its beauty,
Glad are we, glad are we;
Bright is the busy world around us,
Bright with flowers, bright with flowers,
Smiles from the sunny vale above us,
Come with the hours, come with the hours.

Trifle not your time away,
Come to Jesus, come today,
For tomorrow you may be
In a vast eternity.

Rejoice, ye saints! the time draws near
When Christ will in the clouds appear,
And for His people call.

Triumph, ye heavens! rejoice ye with high adoration!
Sing to the Lord, to the Savior, in glad exultation!
Angels give ear! God unto men draweth near,
Bringing to lost ones salvation.

Triumphant Zion! lift thy head
From dust and darkness, and the dead!
Though humbled long, awake at length,
And gird thee with thy Savior’s strength,
And gird thee with thy Savior’s strength.

The triumphs of the saints,
The toils they bravely bore,
The love that never faints,
Their glory evermore—
For these the Church today
Pours forth her joyous lay;
What victors wear so rich a bay?

I'll raise my voice to You O my God, take this troubled soul
Heal my broken heart
O my God, take this troubled soul Heal my broken heart
When I'm surrounded with no escape
When I'm weighed down with chains
My way blocked with stones
Don't hide Your face Answer me quickly
When You brought me here, I was so lost
Your Spirit came, and soothed
My shattered lifeYou calmed my fears
Lord, I'll never abandon You 

Find in me, a true worshipper
Clothed in highest praise
Let me contemplate Your face, O Lord!
Come and anoint my offering of love
As I give You all my Heart 
My God, my Father 
Find in me a tried and true worshipper 

Truehearted, wholehearted, faithful and loyal,
King of our lives, by Thy grace we will be;
Under the standard exalted and royal,
Strong in Thy strength we will battle for Thee.

Truly he comes to us: darkness is ended;
now night is over, his light is ascended:
ultimate sunrise, that floods all creation,
bringing his secret from death's desolation.
Night has made way for the great proclamation;
morning has broken, with songs of elation.
Christ comes in light from the depths of his prison,
death is abandoned, and Jesus is risen.
Stripped of the grave-clothes, the body now glorious
rises immortal, forever victorious;
comes to fulfill all the prophets have spoken;
promise of life that will never be broken.
Weeping is over, and death is defeated;
life is recovered and joy is completed.
Guards, at the sepulcher, scatter before him;
Jesus is risen, and angels adore him.
Highest, most holy, once lost and forsaken:
now, from the sleep of the dead you awaken;
angels appear at the tomb with the story:
"He is not here, but is risen in glory."
Give God the glory and glad adoration,
from whom and through whom and in whom, creation
looks for the joy which, in Christ, we inherit:
praising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit!

Trumpet of God, sound high,
Till the hearts of the heathen shake,
And the souls that in slumber lie
At the voice of the Lord awake.
Till the fenced cities fall
At the blast of the Gospel call,
Trumpet of God, sound high!

All that our Savior hath spoken
Came from the heart of God;
Surely it cannot be broken,
Sealed with His precious blood.

When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

Trust Him when thy wants are many;
Trust Him when thy friends are few;
And the time of swift temptation
Is the time to trust Him too!

Brother, is your face toward the Canaan of rest?
Trust in the promise of the Savior;
Sister, are you bound for the home of the blest?
Trust in the promise of thy Lord.

Jesus, my Shepherd and Savior divine,
Trusting in Thee, trusting in Thee;
O what a foretaste of glory is mine
While I am trusting in Thee!

Simply trusting all the way,
Taking Jesus at His Word;
Simply trusting, when I pray,
Every promise of my Lord.

Simply trusting every day,
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Trusting Jesus, wonderful Guide,
In His keeping safely abide;
Joys eternal He will impart;
Get God’s sunshine into your heart.

Turn back, O man, forswear thy foolish ways.
Old now is earth, and none may count her days.
Yet thou, her child, whose head is crowned with flame,
Still wilt not hear thine inner God proclaim,
 “Turn back, O man, forswear thy foolish ways."

O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There’s a light for a look at the Savior,
And life more abundant and free!

I was lost in sin when Jesus found me,
But He rescued me, all glory to His Name!
And the cords of worldly pleasure bound me,
Till He saved me from sin and shame.

’Twas in the moon of wintertime,
When all the birds had fled,
That mighty Gitchi Manitou
Sent angel choirs instead;
Before their light the stars grew dim,
And wondering hunters heard the hymn:

’Twas in the winter cold, when earth
Was desolate and wild,
That angels welcomed at His birth
The everlasting Child.
From realms of ever bright’ning day,
And from His throne above
He came with humankind to stay,
All lowliness and love.

’Twas on that dark, that doleful night
When powers of earth and hell arose
Against the Son of God’s delight,
And friends betrayed Him to His foes:

’Twas on that night, when doomed to know
The eager rage of every foe,
That night in which He was betrayed,
The Savior of the world took bread.

’Twas the commission of our Lord,
 “Go teach the nations, and baptize:"
The nations have received the word
Since He ascended to the skies.

'Twas with an everlasting love.
That God his own elect embraced
Before he made the worlds above,
Or earth on her huge columns placed.
Long ere the sun's refulgent ray
Primeval shades of darkness drove,
They on his sacred bosom lay,
Loved with an everlasting love.
Then, in His love and His decrees,
Christ and His bride appeared as one,
Her sin, by imputation His,
Whilst she in spotless splendor shone.
Believer, here thy comfort stands,
From first to last salvation's free;
And everlasting love demands
An everlasting song from thee.

Twilight is falling over the sea,
Shadows are stealing dark on the lea;
Borne on the night winds, voices of yore
Come from the far off shore.

Pray on, pray on, O weary not,
Tho’ great thy conflict be;
Look bravely up, and trust in Him
Whose love abides with thee.
Remember how He led thee forth,
Thro’ toil and dangers past;
Tho’ yet unanswered is thy prayer,
 ’Twill all be right at last.

’Twixt gleams of joy and clouds of doubt our feelings come and go;
Our daily state is tossed about in ceaseless ebb and flow.
No mood of feeling, form of thought, is constant for a day;
But Thou, O Lord, Thou changest not, the same Thou art alway.

'Twixt Jesus and the Chosen Race
Subsists a bond of sov'reign grace,
That hell, with its infernal train,
Shall ne'er dissolve, or rend in twain.
This sacred bond shall never break,
Though earth should to her center shake;
Rest, doubting saint, assured of this,
For God has pledged His holiness.
He swore but once the deed was done;
'Twas settled by the great Three One;
Christ was appointed to redeem
All that the Father loved in Him.
Hail, sacred union, firm and strong 
How great thy grace, how sweet the song,
That rebel worms should ever be
One with incarnate Deity!
One in the tomb, one when He rose,
One when he triumphed o'er His foes 
One when in heav'n He took His seat,
While seraphs sung at hell's defeat.
Blessed by the wisdom and the grace,
Th' eternal love and faithfulness,
That's in the gospel scheme revealed,
And is by God the Spirit sealed.

Two brothers freely cast their lot
With David’s royal Son;
The cost of conquest counting not,
They deem the battle won.

O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies,
O they tell me of a home far away;
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise,
O they tell me of an unclouded day.
O the land of cloudless day,
O the land of an unclouded day,
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise,
O they tell me of an unclouded day.
O they tell me of a home where my friends have gone,
O they tell me of that land far away,
Where the tree of life in eternal bloom
Sheds its fragrance through the unclouded day.
O they tell me of a King in His beauty there,
And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
Where He sits on the throne that is whiter than snow,
In the city that is made of gold.
O they tell me that He smiles on His children there,
And His smile drives their sorrows all away;
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
In that lovely land of unclouded day.

Once our blessed Christ of beauty
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suffering, death and sorrow
He has rent the veil in two.
O behold the Man of Sorrows,
O behold Him in plain view;
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.
Now He is with God the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.
Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the well beloved
Since He rent the veil in two.
Throughout time and endless ages,
Heights and depths of love so true;
He alone can be the Giver
Since He rent the veil in two.

Unanswered yet?
The prayers your lips have pleaded
In agony of heart these many years?
Does faith begin to fail, is hope departing,
And think you all in vain those falling tears?
Say not the Father hath not heard your prayer:
You shall have your desire, sometime, somewhere,
You shall have your desire, sometime, somewhere.
Unanswered yet?
Though when you first presented
This one petition at the Father’s throne,
It seemed you could not wait the time of asking,
So urgent was your heart to make it known.
Though years have passed since then, do not despair;
The Lord will answer you, sometime, somewhere,
The Lord will answer you, sometime, somewhere.
Unanswered yet?
Nay, do not say ungranted;
Perhaps your part is not yet wholly done;
The work began when first your prayer was uttered,
And God will finish what He has begun.
If you will keep the incense burning there,
His glory you shall see, sometime somewhere,
His glory you shall see, sometime somewhere.
Unanswered yet?
Faith cannot be unanswered;
Her feet were firmly planted on the Rock;
Amid the wildest storm prayer stands undaunted,
Nor quail before the loudest thunder shock.
She knows Omnipotence has heard her prayer,
And cries, “It shall be done," sometime, somewhere,
And cries, “It shall be done," sometime, somewhere.

You're calling me to lay aside
The worries of my day
To quiet down my busy mind
And find a hiding place
Worthy, you are worthy
I open up my heart
And let my spirit worship yours
I open up my mouth
And let a song of praise come forth
Worthy, you are worthy
Of a childlike faith, and of my honest praise
Of my unashamed love
Of a holy life, and of my sacrifice
Of my unashamed love

Unchanging God, hear from eternal Heav’n:
We plead Thy gifts of grace, forever given,
Thy call, without repentance, calling still,
The sure election of Thy sovereign will.
Out of our faith in Thee, Who canst not lie,
Out of our heart’s desire, goes up our cry,
From hope’s sweet vision of the thing to be,
From love to those who still are loved by Thee.
Bring Thy beloved back, Thine Israel,
Thine own elect who from Thy favor fell,
But not from Thine election! O forgive,
Speak but the word, and lo! the dead shall live.
Father of mercies! these the long astray,
These in soul blindness now the far away,
These are not aliens, but Thy sons of yore,
Oh, by Thy Fatherhood, restore, restore!
Breathe upon Thy Church, that it may greet the day;
Stir up her will to toil, and teach, and pray,
Till Zionward again salvation come,
And all her outcast children are at home.
Triune Jehovah, Thine the grace and power,
Thine all the work, its past, its future hour,
O Thou, Who failest not, Thy gifts fulfill,
And crown the calling of Thy changeless will.

Under His wings I am safely abiding,
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me,
He has redeemed me, and I am His child.
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.
Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly turns to His rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, and there I am blessed.
Under His wings, oh, what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till life’s trials are o’er;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me,
Resting in Jesus, I’m safe evermore.

Lord, keep my soul from day to day,
Under the blood, under the blood;
Take doubt and fear and sin away,
Under the precious blood.
Under the blood, the precious blood,
Under the cleansing, healing flood;
Keep me, Savior, from day to day;
Under the precious blood.
The sinner’s refuge here alone,
Under the blood, under the blood;
Here Jesus makes salvation known,
Under the precious blood.
Lord, with Thyself my spirit fill,
Under the blood, under the blood;
And work in me to do Thy will,
Under the precious blood.
Sweet peace abides within the heart,
Under the blood, under the blood;
And gifts divine their joy impart,
Under the precious blood.
The Holy Spirit, hour by hour,
Under the blood, under the blood,
Exerts His sanctifying power,
Under the precious blood.

I'm under the blood of Emanuel's cross,
Happy in Jesus my Lord;
I count the vain treasures of earth as but loss,
Under the precious blood.
Under the blood, under the blood,
Heaven so freely gave;
Under the blood, under the blood,
Blood of the Mighty to save.
I'm under the blood of the crucified One,
Saved from the power of sin;
Rejoicing in glory the victory won,
Under the precious blood.
I'm under the blood that was shed on the tree,
Cleansed in the river divine;
I'm sanctified wholly, forever to be
Under the precious blood.
I'm under the blood that preserves from all sin,
Walking in wonderful light;
Soon heaven will open to welcome me in,
Under the precious blood.
I'm under the blood, and to Jesus I bring
Honor and glory divine;
Soon with the redeemed of all ages I'll sing,
Saved by the precious blood.

Lord, I sometimes feel just like a stranger
here in this dreary world below.
And nobody knows the sorrow that I bear,
Or how heavy, my load.
But in Thee dear Lord I have a Precious Friend
and my faith looks up to Thee.
Let me rise and go, for this dreary world below
is an unfriendly world to me.
(2x):
Here I wander, like a beggar
Through the heat and the cold.
And my burdens, are so heavy,
Lord my sorrow, is untold.
But to Jesus, I am clinging,
Let me hide, Lord, in Thee.
For this old world, with its sorrow,
is an unfriendly world to me.

Unless the Lord Builds the House
The builders they labor in vain
Unless the Lord watches over our town,
The watchmen stand guard in vain.
Be exalted, oh God.
Verse:
Some trust in horses, some chariots
But we will trust in, the name of our God
()
If God is for us who can be against us?
If God is for us who can be against us?
We’ll have the victory all the time whoa….
We’ll have the victory all the ti – me.
()

Unless the Lord the house shall build,
The weary builders toil in vain;
Unless the Lord the city shield,
The guards a useless watch maintain.
In vain you rise ere morning break,
And late your nightly vigils keep,
And of the bread of toil partake;
God gives to His beloved sleep.
Lo, children are a great reward,
A gift from God in very truth;
With arrows is his quiver stored
Who joys in children of his youth.
And blest the man whose age is cheered
By stalwart sons and daughters fair;
No enemies by him are feared,
No lack of love, no want of care.

Unmoved by fear, my praise is due
To Thee, Thou gracious God of saints;
Thy mercies great, Thy counsel true,
My prayers are heard and my complaints;
My prayers are heard and my complaints.
Compassed by love, my heart’s best thought
I raise in gratitude to Thee;
Nor wait to thank Thee; all untaught,
Thy love’s best gift hath taught it me;
Thy love’s best gift hath taught it me.
I fear but that I may not gain
A place beside my noblest Friend;
I love, but ah, the sweet ,
“On Thee, my Savior, I depend;
On Thee, my Savior, I depend."

Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ,
Wealth that can never be told!
Riches exhaustless of mercy and grace,
Precious, more precious than gold!
Precious, more precious,
Wealth that can never be told!
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!
Precious, more precious than gold.
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!
Who shall their greatness declare?
Jewels whose luster our lives may adorn,
Pearls that the poorest may wear!
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!
Freely, how freely they flow,
Making the souls of the faithful and true
Happy wherever they go!
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!
Who would not gladly endure
Trials, afflictions, and crosses on earth,
Riches like these to secure!

My heart can sing when I pause to remember
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along a trail that's winding always upward,
This troubled world is not my final home.
But until then my heart will go on singing,
Until then with joy I'll carry on,
Until the day my eyes behold the city,
Until the day God calls me home.
The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for awhile;
And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
Remembered there will only bring a smile.
But until then my heart will go on singing,
Until then with joy I'll carry on,
Until the day my eyes behold the city,
Until the day God calls me home.
This weary world with all its toil and struggle
May take its toll of misery and strife;
The soul of man is like a waiting falcon;
When it's released, it's destined for the skies.
But until then my heart will go on singing,
Until then with joy I'll carry on,
Until the day my eyes behold the city,
Until the day God calls me home.

Unto God our Savior sing a joyful song;
Wondrous are His doings, for His arm is strong.
He was wrought salvation, He has made it known,
And before the nations is His justice known.
Joyful, all ye people, sing before the Lord;
Shout and sing His praises now in glad accord;
With the harp and trumpet joyful praises bring;
Come, rejoice before Him, God, the Lord, your King.
Waves of mighty ocean, earth with fullness stored,
Floods and fields and mountains, sing before the Lord;
For He comes with justice, evil to redress,
And to judge the nations in His righteousness.

Unto my Lord Jehovah said,
“At My right hand I throne Thee,
Till at Thy feet, in triumph laid,
Thy foes their Ruler crown Thee."
From Zion shall Jehovah send
Thy scepter, till before Thee bend
The knees of proud rebellion.
Thy saints, to greet Thy day of might,
In holy raiment muster;
As dewdrops in the morning light
Thy youths around Thee cluster.
Jehovah sware and made decree,
“Thou, King of Righteousness, shalt be
A royal Priest forever."
The Lord at Thy right hand shall bring
On rulers desolation;
The Lord shall smite each heathen king,
And judge each rebel nation.
He, swiftly marching in His wrath,
Shall quaff the brook upon His path,
And lift His head in glory.

Unto the hills around do I lift up
My longing eyes;
O whence for me shall my salvation come,
From whence arise?
From God, the Lord, doth come my certain aid,
From God, the Lord, who heav'n and earth hath made.
He will not suffer that thy foot be moved:
Safe shalt thou be.
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close,
Who keepeth thee.
Behold, our God, the Lord, He slumbereth ne'er,
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.
Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true,
Thy changeless shade;
Jehovah thy defense on thy right hand
Himself hath made.
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite;
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.
From ev'ry evil shall He keep thy soul,
From ev'ry sin;
Jehovah shall preserve thy going out,
Thy coming in.
Above thee watching, He whom we adore
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, for evermore.

Unto the hills around do I lift up my longing eyes
O whence for me shall my salvation come, from whence arise?
From God, the Lord, doth come my certain aid,
From God, the Lord, Who heaven and earth hath made.
He will not suffer that thy foot be moved: safe shalt thou be.
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close, Who keepeth thee.
Behold, He sleepeth not, He slumbereth ne’er,
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.
Jehovah is Himself thy Keeper true, thy changeless Shade;
Jehovah thy Defense on thy right hand Himself hath made.
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite;
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.
From every evil shall He keep thy soul, from every sin;
Jehovah shall preserve thy going out, thy coming in.
Above thee watching, He Whom we adore
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, forevermore.

I rejoiced when they said to me,
"Let us go unto the house of the Lord."
Standing there, O Jerusalem,
In your gates unto the house of the Lord
Look upon Jerusalem, the city now restored
Here the tribes of Yahweh come as one unto the Lord
As he ordered Isreal, they come to praise his name
Here where courts of justice , the courts of David reign
Pray for peace Jerusalem, prosperity at home
Peace inside your city walls that comes from God alone
Since we are God's people, I say, "Peace be to you"
May the God who dwells in us your happiness renew!!"

Unto Thy temple, Lord, we come
With thankful hearts to worship Thee;
And pray that this may be our home
Until we touch eternity.
The common home of rich and poor,
Of bond and free, and great and small;
Large as Thy love forevermore,
And warm and bright and good to all.
And dwell Thou with us in this place,
Thou and Thy Christ, to guide and bless!
Here make the wellspring of Thy grace
Like fountains in the wilderness.
May Thy whole truth be spoken here;
Thy Gospel light forever shine;
Thy perfect love cast out all fear,
And human life become divine.

Unto us a Boy is born,
King of all creation:
Came He to world forlorn,
Lord of every nation.
Cradled in a stall was He
’Midst the cows and asses;
But the very beasts could see
He all men surpasses.
Herod then with fear was filled:
“A prince," he said, “in Jewry!"
All the little boys he killed
At Bethl’em in his fury.
Now may Mary’s Son, Who came
Long ago to love us,
Lead us all with hearts aflame
To the joys above us.
Omega and Alpha He!
Let the organ thunder,
While the choir with peals of glee
Rends the air asunder.

Unto us a Child is born,
Christians, hear the story;
In this world our flesh is worn,
By Christ, the Lord of glory.
In a manger He is laid,
Where the kine are sleeping;
Angels recognize their Lord,
And o’er Him watch are keeping.
Haughty Herod trembles now,
Great his fear and sorrow;
Bethl’em’s infants he will slay
Before the dawn tomorrow.
Jesu, born of virgin maid,
In Thy visitation
Show Thy mercy, Lord, on us,
And grant us Thy salvation.
Alpha and Omega, Thine
Be this day our ;
King of kings, and Lord of lords,
Now let Thy grace be o’er us.

Helper, Keeper
Protector, Preserver, Provider
You are my all
All the time, without rest
Yeshua
Unto You be glory, glory
Unto You be honor
Unto You be praised, Jesus
Forever, and ever
All I wanna do is exalt You
All I wanna do is lift You high
All I wanna do is to please You
All I wanna do is make You smile

Untold millions are still untold
Untold millions are still outside the fold
Who will tell them of Jesus' love
And the heavenly mansions awaiting above
Jesus died on Calvary to save each one from sin
Now he calls to you and to me
To go and bring them in
For many untold millions are still untold
Untold millions are outside the fold
Who will tell them of Jesus' love
And the heavenly mansions awaiting above

Unworthy am I of the grace that He gave,
Unworthy to hold to His hand;
Amazed that a King would reach down to a slave,
This love I cannot understand.
Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar;
In bondage and alone;
But He made me worthy and now by His grace,
His mercy has made me His own.
My sorrow and sickness laid stripes on His back,
My sins caused the blood that was shed;
My faults and my failures have woven a crown
Of thorns, that He wore on His head.
Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar;
In bondage and alone;
But He made me worthy and now by His grace,
His mercy has made me His own.
Unworthy am I of the glory to come,
Unworthy with angels to sing;
I thrill just to know that He loved me so much,
A pauper, I walk with the King 
Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar;
In bondage and alone;
But He made me worthy and now by His grace,
His mercy has made me His own.

Up and onward, Christian workers,
Life is fleeting, do not stray;
Great the harvest, few the toilers,
Up and onward, haste away!
Haste away, then, Christian workers,
Hear the deep, despairing call;
Go and rescue those that perish,
Lend a helping hand to all.
Where the reapers bear their burdens
In the toil and heat of day,
Where the golden sheaves are waving,
Up and onward, haste away!
Where the conflict fiercely rages
On the battlefield today,
With our banner, shield and buckler,
Up and onward, haste away!
Consecrated to the service
Of our Savior and our Lord;
Ever faithful, true and earnest,
We shall gain the great reward.

Up in Heaven, up in Heaven,
In the bright place far away,
He Whom bad men crucified,
Sitteth at His Father’s side,
Til the Judgment Day.
And He loves His little children,
And He pleadeth for them there,
Asking the great God of Heav’n
That their sins may be forgiven,
And He hears their prayer.
Never more a helpless Baby,
Born in poverty and pain,
But with awful glory crowned,
With His angels standing round,
He shall come again.
Then the wicked souls shall tremble,
And the good souls shall rejoice;
Parents, children, every one,
Then shall stand before His throne,
And shall hear His voice.
And all faithful holy Christians,
Who their Master’s work have done,
Shall appear at His right hand
And inherit the fair land
That His love has won.

Up to the bountiful Giver of life,
Gathering home! gathering home!
Up to the dwelling where cometh no strife,
The dear ones are gathering home.
Gathering home! Gathering home!
Never to sorrow more, never to roam.
Gathering home! Gathering home!
God’s children are gathering home!
Up to the city where falleth no night,
Gathering home! gathering home!
Up where the Savior’s own face is the light,
The dear ones are gathering home.
Up to the beautiful mansions above,
Gathering home! gathering home!
Safe in the arms of His infinite love,
The dear ones are gathering home.

Up to the throne of God is borne
The voice of praise at early morn,
And he accepts the punctual hymn
Sung as the light of day grows dim:
Nor will He turn His ear aside
From holy offerings at noontide:
Then here reposing let us raise
A song of gratitude and praise.
What though our burthen be not light,
We need not toil from morn to night;
The respite of the mid-day hour
Is in the thankful creature’s power.
Blest are the moments, doubly blest,
That, drawn from this one hour of rest,
Are with a ready heart bestowed
Upon the service of our God!
Each field is then a hallowed spot,
An altar is in each man’s cot,
A church in every grove that spreads
Its living roof above our heads.
Look up to Heaven! the industrious sun
Already half his race hath run;
‘He’ cannot halt nor go astray,
But our immortal spirits may.
Lord! since his rising in the East,
If we have faltered or transgressed,
Guide, from Thy love’s abundant source,
What yet remains of this day’s course:
Help with Thy grace, through life’s short day,
Our upward and our downward way;
And glorify for us the west,
When we shall sink to final rest.

Up to the throne on high,
In loyal love and trust,
We, children of an hour,
Lift voices from the dust.
Suffer us not to stray
From thee, our God, our Guide,
Whatever trials come,
Whatever ills betide.
Grant us in mercy, Lord,
The gifts thou deemest best,
Help for the daily task,
And for our spirits rest.
Strong in the power of faith,
From doubt and care set free,
We tread the appointed path
That brings us home to thee.
Bid empty terror cease;
Neath thy o'ershadowing might
Uphold our hearts in hope,
And lead us into light.

Upon life’s boundless ocean where mighty billows roll,
I’ve fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering o’er,
I rest upon His mercy and trust Him more.
I’ve anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I’ll brave,
I’ve anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave.
I’ve anchored in Jesus, for He hath power to save,
I’ve anchored to the Rock of Ages.
He keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters and bid their tumult cease;
My Pilot and Deliverer, to Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, He’s at my side.
He is my Friend and Savior, in Him my anchor’s cast,
He drives away my sorrows and shields me from the blast;
By faith I’m looking upward beyond life’s troubled sea,
There I behold a haven prepared for me.

Upon the cross extended,
See, world, thy Lord suspended.
Thy Savior yields His breath.
The Prince of Life from Heaven
Himself hath freely given
To shame and blows and bitter death.
Come hither now and ponder,
’Twill fill thy soul with wonder,
Blood streams from every pore.
Through grief whose depth none knoweth,
From His great heart there floweth
Sigh after sigh of anguish o’er.
Who is it that hath bruised Thee?
Who hath so sore abused Thee
And caused Thee all Thy woe?
While we must make confession
Of sin and dire transgression,
Thou deeds of evil dost not know.
I caused Thy grief and sighing
By evils multiplying
As countless as the sands.
I caused the woes unnumbered
With which Thy soul is cumbered,
Thy sorrows raised by wicked hands.
’Tis I who should be smitten,
My doom should here be written;
Bound hand and foot in hell.
The fetters and the scourging,
The floods around Thee surging,
’Tis I who have deserved them well.
The load Thou takest on Thee,
That pressed so sorely on me,
It crushed me to the ground.
The cross for me enduring,
The crown for me securing,
My healing in Thy wounds is found.
A crown of thorns Thou wearest,
My shame and scorn Thou bearest,
That I might ransomed be.
My Bondsman, ever willing,
My place with patience filling,
From sin and guilt hast made me free.
Thy cords of love, my Savior,
Bind me to Thee forever,
I am no longer mine.
To Thee I gladly tender
All that my life can render
And all I have to Thee resign.
Thy cross I’ll place before me,
Its saving power be o’er me,
Wherever I may be;
Thine innocence revealing,
Thy love and mercy sealing,
The pledge of truth and constancy.
How God at our transgression
To anger gives expression,
How loud His thunders roll,
How fearfully He smiteth,
How sorely He requiteth—
All this Thy sufferings teach my soul.
When evil men revile me,
With wicked tongues defile me,
I’ll curb my vengeful heart.
The unjust wrong I’ll suffer,
Unto my neighbor offer
Forgiveness of each bitter smart.
Thy groaning and Thy sighing,
Thy bitter tears and dying,
With which Thou was opprest—
They shall, when life is ending,
Be guiding and attending
My way to Thine eternal rest.

Upon the Gospel’s sacred page
The gathered beams of ages shine;
And, as it hastens, every age
But makes its brightness more divine.
On mightier wing, in loftier flight,
From year to year does knowledge soar;
And, as it soars, the Gospel light
Becomes effulgent more and more.
More glorious still, as centuries roll,
New regions blest, new powers unfurled,
Expanding with the expanding soul,
Its radiance shall o’er flow the world.
Flow to restore, but not destroy,
As when the cloudless lamp of day
Pours out its floods of light and joy,
And sweeps the lingering mists away.

Upon the holy mount they stood
that wondrous, awful night;
they saw, and knew that it was good
to see that vision bright.
No Man of Sorrows stands there now;
but, keen as lightning flame,
the streams of heavenly radiance flow
from that transfigured frame.
Beneath that mount another scene
they saw, when morning smiled;
a father, torn with anguish keen,
sought mercy for his child.
No more the blaze of glistering light
enwraps the form divine,
but tender love and healing might
around him softly shine.
He came from hours of rapture high
to care for human woe;
so angels from God's presence fly
to succor men below.
O Jesus, be our life like thine;
blest labor, doubly blest
by communings with things divine
upon the mountain crest.
Lord, we would pass from hours of prayer,
that lift our souls above,
to go where want and sorrow are
with lowly deeds of love.
Let no self-will within us lurk,
no faithless sloth be there;
but prayer give life to all our work,
and work crown all our prayer.

Upward where the stars are burning,
Silent, silent in their turning
Round the never changing pole;
Upward where the sky is brightest,
Upward where the blue is lightest,
Lift I now my longing soul.
Far above that arch of gladness,
Far beyond these clouds of sadness,
Are the many mansions fair.
Far from pain and sin and folly,
In that palace of the holy,
I would find my mansion there.
Where the glory brightly dwelleth,
Where the new song sweetly swelleth,
And the discord never comes;
Where life’s stream is ever laving,
And the palm is ever waving,
That must be the home of homes.
Where the Lamb on high is seated,
By ten thousand voices greeted,
Lord of lords, and King of kings.
Son of Man, they crown, they crown Him,
Son of God, they own, they own Him;
With His Name the palace rings.
Blessing, honor, without measure,
Heavenly riches, earthly treasure,
Lay we at His blessed feet:
Poor the praise that now we render,
Loud shall be our voices yonder,
When before His throne we meet.

I am nothing more than a useless hammer
Until placed in the carpenter's hand
I am nothing more than a wand'ring pilgrim
All alone in a far-away land
Im am nothing more than a very small child
Not yet grown up into a man
I am nothing more than a useless hammer
Until placed in the carpenter's hand 
Use me Lord
This will always be my humble plea
Give me faith
Built upon the cross of Calvary 
It's all from You (all from You), and not from me (not from me)
You showed the way (showed the way), and now I see (now I see)
That I am.
Use me Lord
I will be your servant to the end
Give me strength
Like a tempered steel, I will not blend 
It's all from You (all from You), and not from me (not from me)
You showed the way (showed the way), and now I see (now I see)
That I am.
A hammer lays quiet and lifeless and still
It can't on its own do a thing
But placed in the hands fo the one with the skill
Its pounding will make Heavens ring 

A virgin did come from lowliest home,
And shelter she fain in a manger would find;
For full was the inn, and no room was within,
Save where to the stalls the mute oxen they bind.
O how wondrous the love and the deep humility
Of Him Who was laid in the manger for me.
That Babe was a King, mystic gifts, lo, they bring,
Sure tokens they were of some great One to be;
To Bethlehem led, Eastern sages have sped
From afar “The Desire of all nations" to see.
Accomplished their hope, their treasures they ope—
Gold, frankincense, myrrh, to that Infant they brought,
Gifts costly and rare, full of meaning they were,
Though not yet unveiled were the great truths they taught.
No tokens of state round that royal Babe wait,
Seeming least, and yet greatest, of monarchs was He;
But in reverence low, princely Magi did bow,
As though they divined all His true dignity.

A virgin most pure, as the prophets do tell,
Hath brought forth a Baby, as it hath befell,
To be our Redeemer from death, hell and sin,
Which Adam’s transgression has wrapped us in.
And therefore be merry, set sorrow aside;
Christ Jesus our Savior was born on this tide.
At Bethlehem city, in Jewry it was
Where Joseph and Mary together did pass,
And there to be taxed, with many one more,
For Cæsar commanded the same should be so.
But, when they had entered the city so fair
A number of people so mighty was there,
That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,
Could get in the city no lodging at all.
Then were they constrained in a stable to lie,
Where oxen and asses they used to tie;
Their lodging so simple, they held it no scorn,
But against the next morning our Savior was born.
The King of all glory to this world being brought,
Small store of fine linen to wrap Him was sought,
When Mary had swaddled her young Son so sweet,
Within an ox manger she laid Him to sleep.
Then God sent an angel from Heaven so high,
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,
And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,
Because that our Savior was born on this day.
Then presently after, the shepherds did spy
A number of angels appear in the sky;
Who joyfully talked and sweetly did sing,
To God be all glory, our heavenly King.
Three certain wise princes, they thought it most meet
To lay their rich offerings at our Savior’s feet;
Then the Shepherds consented, and to Bethlehem did go,
And when they came thither, they found it was so.

A virgin pure, both meek and mild
In Bethlehem brought forth her Child,
In Bethlehem brought forth her Child;
Our nature first on Him to take,
And then, as Christ, our peace to make,
Our nature first on Him to take,
And then, as Christ, our peace to make.
Consider what the spotless Lamb
Did undergo for sinful man,
Did undergo for sinful man,
Nailed to the cross to pain and die,
While wicked spies stood gazing by!
Nailed to the cross to pain and die,
While wicked spies stood gazing by!
Who can express the joy and love
That God sent down from Heaven above
That God sent down from Heaven above
From Satan’s power redeeming all,
When we were lost by Adam’s fall?
From Satan’s power redeeming all,
When we were lost by Adam’s fall?
Then let us praise the God of Heaven,
Who unto us His Son hath giv’n,
Who unto us His Son hath giv’n,
Hath sent Him down with us to dwell
Our Jesus our Emmanuel,
Hath sent Him down with us to dwell
Our Jesus our Emmanuel.

A virgin unspotted, the prophet foretold,
Should bring forth a Savior, which now we behold,
To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,
Which Adam’s transgression had wrapped us in.
Aye and therefore be merry, set sorrow aside,
Christ Jesus our Savior was born on this tide.
At Bethlehem city in Jewry it was
That Joseph and Mary together did pass,
All for to be taxed with many one moe [sic],
Great Caesar commanded the same should be so.
But when they had entered the city so fair,
A number of people so mighty was there,
That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,
Could find in the inn there no lodging at all.
Then were they constrained in a stable to lie,
Where horses and asses they used for to tie;
Their lodging so simple they took it no scorn,
But against the next morning our Savior was born.
The King of all kings to this world being brought,
Small store of fine linen to wrap Him was sought,
But when she had swaddled her young Son so sweet,
Within an ox manger she laid Him to sleep.
Then God sent an angel from Heaven so high,
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,
And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,
Because that our Savior was born on this day.
Then presently after the shepherds did spy
Vast numbers of angels to stand in the sky;
They joyfully talked and sweetly did sing,
To God be all glory, our heavenly King.
To teach us humility all this was done,
And learn we from thence haughty pride for to shun:
A manger His cradle Who came from above,
The great God of mercy, of peace and of love.

A voice is heard in the dewy dawn,
And the call is sweet and low;
Come now, my child to the Shepherd’s fold,
Where the living waters flow;
But the gay heart answers in careless tones,
As light as the morning chime,
“Let me live for the world just a little while,
I will come to God—sometime!"
Beware! Beware! At the pearly gate
God may answer your sometime, too late! too late!
Beware! Beware! At the pearly gate
God may answer your sometime, too late! too late!
The day is nearing the noontide glow,
And the voice is heard again,
It calls the soul to a nobler life,
’Tis a patient, kind ;
Enter now the Master’s broad harvest field,
In the strength of your early prime,
Come and bring to His work service good and true,
Still the same reply—“sometime!"
The feet are treading the western slope,
And the air is growing chill;
O can it be God is waiting yet,
That His voice is pleading still?
That He’ll flood with beauty the sunset sky,
Bright rays from the Golden Clime?
But the sinner long hardened, has turned away,
With the fatal word—“sometime!"
O soul, take heed, ere the shadows fall,
And the day of grace be past,
For how shall a trembling sinner stand
By the gates of death at last?
Hear the Savior’s call; at the Cross lay down
Thy burden of guilt and crime,
And the angels shall sing thee a sweeter song
Than the sad “Sometime."

A voice upon the midnight air,
Where Kedron’s moonlit waters stray,
Weeps forth in agony of prayer,
“O Father, take this cup away."
Ah! Thou Who sorrowest unto death,
We conquer in Thy mortal fray;
And earth for all her children saith,
“O God, take not this cup away."
O Lord of sorrow, meekly die:
Thou’lt heal or hallow all our woe;
Thy Name refresh the mourner’s sigh,
Thy peace revive the faint and low.
Great Chief of faithful souls, arise,
None else can lead the martyr band,
Who teach the brave how peril flies,
When faith, unarmed, uplifts the hand.
O King of earth, the cross ascend;
O’er climes and ages ’tis Thy throne;
Where’er Thy fading eye may bend,
The desert blooms, and is Thine own.
Thy parting blessing, Lord, we pray;
Make but one fold, below, above;
And when we go the last lone way,
O give the welcome of Thy love.

I have entered the valley of blessing so sweet,
And Jesus abides with me there;
And His Spirit and blood make my cleansing complete,
And His perfect love casteth out fear.
Oh, come to this valley of blessing so sweet,
Where Jesus will fullness bestow;
And believe, and receive, and confess Him,
That all His salvation may know.
There is peace in the valley of blessing so sweet,
And plenty the land doth impart;
And there’s rest for the weary, worn traveler’s feet,
And joy for the sorrowing heart.
There is love in the valley of blessing so sweet,
Such as none but the blood-washed may feel,
When Heaven comes down redeemed spirits to greet,
And Christ sets His covenant seal.
There’s a song in the valley of blessing so sweet,
And angels would fain join the strain,
As with rapturous praises we bow at His feet,
Crying, “Worthy the Lamb that was slain!"

No more need fear, and no more need doubting,
No more need pride control in my life.
I may be free from all condemnation,
I can have victory now in the strife.
I take the life of victory,
Not I, but Christ Himself in me;
He conquers now, He sets me free;
I take, He gives—the victory.
There is a place, praise God, I have found it!
There is a place where we may be free;
Free from defeat, with power surrounded;
Yes, there is victory, Jesus, in Thee.
Precious provision, wonderful prospect,
Jesus will rule and Jesus will lead;
He is my Shepherd, He is my Keeper,
He is my Bread of Life, on Him I feed.

The virgin stills the crying
Of Jesus, sleepless lying;
And singing for His pleasure,
Thus calls upon her Treasure, 
“My Darling, do not weep,
My Jesu, sleep!"
O Lamb, my love inviting,
O Star, my soul delighting,
O Flower of mine own bearing,
O Jewel past comparing!
My Child, of Might indwelling,
My Sweet, all sweets excelling,
Of bliss the Fountain flowing,
The Dayspring ever glowing,
My Joy, my Exultation,
My spirit’s Consolation;
My Son, my Spouse, my Brother,
O listen to Thy mother!
Say, would’st Thou heav’nly sweetness,
Or love of answering meetness?
Or is fit music wanting?
Ho! Angels, raise your chanting!

The voice of free grace cries, “Escape to the mountain;
For Adam’s lost race Christ hath opened a fountain:
For sin and uncleanness, and every transgression,
His blood flows most freely, in streams of salvation,
His blood flows most freely, in streams of salvation."
Hallelujah to the Lamb, Who has purchased our pardon!
We will praise Him again when we pass over Jordan,
We will praise Him again when we pass over Jordan.
Now glory to God in the highest is given;
Now glory to God is re-echoed in Heaven;
Around the whole earth let us tell the glad story,
And sing of His love, His salvation and glory,
And sing of His love, His salvation and glory.
O Jesus, ride on—Thy kingdom is glorious;
O’er sin, death and hell, Thou wilt make us victorious:
Thy Name shall be praised in the great congregation,
And saints shall ascribe unto Thee their salvation,
And saints shall ascribe unto Thee their salvation.
When on Zion we stand, having gained the blest shore,
With our harps in our hands, we will praise evermore;
We’ll range the blest fields on the banks of the river,
And sing of redemption forever and ever,
And sing of redemption forever and ever.

The voice of God is calling its summons in our day;
Isaiah heard in Zion and we now hear God say:
“Whom shall I send to succor my people in their need?
Whom shall I send to loosen the bonds of shame and greed?"
“I hear My people crying in slum and mine and mill;
No field or mart is silent, no city street is still.
I see My people falling in darkness and despair.
Whom shall I send to shatter the fetters which they bear?"
We heed, O Lord, Your summons, and answer: Here are we!
Send us upon Your errand, let us Your servants be.
Our strength is dust and ashes, our years a passing hour;
But You can use our weakness to magnify Your power.
From ease and plenty save us; from pride of place absolve;
Purge us of low desire; lift us to high resolve;
Take us, and make us holy; teach us Your will and way.
Speak, and behold! We answer; command, and we obey!

The Voice of God’s Creation found me
Perplexed midst hope and fear,
For though His sunshine flashed around me,
His storms at times drew near:
And I said—
Oh! that I knew where He abideth!
For doubts beset our lot,
And lo! His glorious face He hideth,
And men perceive it not!
The Voice of God’s Protection told me
He loveth all He made;
I seemed to feel His arms enfold me,
And yet was half afraid:
And I said—
Oh! that I knew where I might find Him!
His eye would guide me right:
He leaveth countless tracks behind Him,
Yet passeth out of sight.
The Voice of Conscience sounded nearer,
It stirred my inmost breast;
But though its tones were firmer, clearer,
’Twas not the voice of rest:
And I said—
Oh! that I knew if He forgiveth!
My soul is faint within,
Because in grievous fear it liveth
Of wages due to sin.
It was the Voice of Revelation
That met my utmost need;
The wondrous message of salvation
Was joy and peace indeed:
And I said—
Oh! how I love the sacred pages
From which such tidings flow,
As monarchs, patriarchs, poets, sages,
Have longed in vain to know!
For now is life a lucid story,
And death a rest in Him,
And all is bathed in light and glory
That once was dark or dim:
And I said—
O Thou Who dost my soul deliver,
And all its hopes uplift;
Give me a tongue praise the Giver,
A heart to prize the gift.

The voice says, Cry! What shall we cry?
“All flesh is grass, and like the flower
Its glories droop, its pleasures die,
Its joys but last one fleeting hour."
The voice says, Cry! O piteous cry!
And are there none to help and save?
Have all that live beneath the sky
No other prospect but a grave?
The voice says, Cry! Yet glorious cry!
The Word of God can never fall,
And tells how Jesus, throned on high,
Holds out eternal life to all.
The voice says, Cry! Who needs the cry?
O brother men! who needs it not?
By countless millions, far and nigh,
’Tis still unheard, despised, forgot.
The voice says, Cry! What stops the cry?
Our greed of wealth, our love of ease,
Our lack of earnest will to try
Mankind to save, and God to please.
The voice says, Cry! O let us cry!
Though standing on death’s awful brink,
Men feast, they jest, they sell, they buy,
And cannot see, and will not think.
The voice says, Cry! Lord, we would cry
But of Thy goodness teach us how;
For fast the hours of mercy fly,
And, if we cry, it must be now!

The voice that breathed o’er Eden, that earliest wedding day,
The primal wedding blessing, it hath not passed away.
Still in the pure espousal of Christian man and maid
The Holy Three are with us, the threefold grace is said.
For dower of blessed children,
For love and faith’s sweet sake,
For high mysterious union
Which naught on earth may break.
Be present, awful Father, to give away this bride
As Thou gav’st Eve to Adam, a helpmate at his side.
Be present, Son of Mary, to join their loving hands
As Thou didst bind two natures in Thine eternal bands.
Be present, Holy Spirit, to bless them as they kneel,
As Thou for Christ, the Bridegroom, the heav’nly Spouse dost seal.
O spread Thy pure wing o’er them, let no ill power find place
When onward to Thine altar their hallowed path they trace.
To cast their crowns before Thee in perfect sacrifice,
Till to the home of gladness with Christ’s own Bride they rise.
To Father, Son, and Spirit, eternal One and Three,
And was and is forever, all praise and glory be.

Vain are all terrestrial pleasures,
Mixed with dross the purest gold:
Seek we, then, for heavenly treasures,
Treasures never waxing old.
Let our best affections center
On the things around the throne:
There no thief can ever enter;
Moth and rust are there unknown.
Earthly joys no longer please us;
Here would we renounce them all;
Seek our only rest in Jesus,
Him our Lord and Master call.
Faith, our languid spirits cheering,
Points to brighter worlds above;
Bids us look for His appearing;
Bids us triumph in His love.
May our light be always burning,
And our loins be girded round,
Waiting for our Lord’s returning,
Longing for the welcome sound.
Thus the Christian life adorning,
Never need we be afraid,
Should He come at night or morning
Early dawn, or evening shade.

Vain are the hopes the sons of men
On their own works have built;
Their hears by nature all unclean,
And all their actions guilt.
Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouths.
Without a murm'ring word,
And the whole race of Adam stand
Guilty before the Lord.
In vain we ask God's righteous law,
To justify us now,
Since to convince and to condemn
Is all the law can do.
Jesus, how glorious is thy grace,
When in thy name we trust;
Our faith receives a righteousness
That makes the sinner just.

Valley lilies, meek and lowly,
Let me hear your message sweet,
Tell of Christ the pure and holy,
Bending as to touch His feet.
Snowy lilies of the valley,
Speak again your message rare;
Testify to me of Jesus,
Heaven’s Lily, wondrous fair!
Valley lilies, golden hearted,
Love’s sweet mission you fulfill,
For you tell in perfumed language,
How He wrought His Father’s will.
Valley lilies, cups inverted,
Still the Master you proclaim:
Empty of all pomp and glory,
To redeem the world He came.

Veil, Lord, mine eyes till she be past,
When Folly tempts my sight;
Keep Thou my palate and my taste
From gluttonous delight.
Stop Thou mine ear from sirens’ songs,
My tongue from lies restrain;
Withhold my hands from doing wrongs,
My feet from courses vain.
Teach, likewise, ev’ry other sense
To act an honest part,
But chiefly settle innocence
And pureness in my heart;
So naught without me or within,
Shall work an ill effect,
By tempting me to act a sin,
Or virtues to neglect.

Veiled in darkness Judah lay,
Waiting for the promised day,
While across the shadowy night
Streamed a flood of glorious light,
Heav’nly voices chanting then,
“Peace on earth, good will to men."
Still the earth in darkness lies.
Up from death’s dark vale arise
Voices of a world in grief,
Prayers of men who seek relief:
Now our darkness pierce again,
“Peace on earth, good will to men."
Light of light, we humbly pray,
Shine upon Thy world today;
Break the gloom of our dark night,
Fill our souls with love and light,
Send Thy blessed Word again,
“Peace on earth, good will to men."

She was just 16
Blonde hair and full of life
Livin' on Monday like she lived on Sunday
Could have made a wonderful wife
But in an instant she was gone
No goodbyes, no calls on the phone
Just friends left behind 
How much longer will you wait?
How much time will it take
For the Spirit to touch your heart my friend?
He's begging and pleading to come in
He's trying time and time again
Before it gets too late 
All her friends gather 'round
Hear of the real sad news
There's more pain now in their young hearts
No comforting words will do
They need the peace found in Him
No excuses, no more lies
Just givin' it to the Lord 
I hear the trumpet sound
There in the distant sky
Flashes of light and rays of hope
As Jesus claims His bride
In an instant He will come
No more begging, no more pleading
It's time to go home 
Before it gets too late
Before it gets too late

Oh, what a Savior that He died for me!
From condemnation He hath made me free;
“He that believeth on the Son," said He,
“Hath everlasting life."
“Verily, verily, I say unto you;
Verily, verily," message ever new!
“He that believeth on the Son" ’tis true!
“Hath everlasting life!"
All my iniquities on Him were laid,
All my indebtedness by Him was paid;
All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,
“Hath everlasting life."
Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord;
Though weak and sinful I believe His Word;
O glad message! Every child of God
“Hath everlasting life."
Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt;
For him that cometh He will not cast out:
“He that believeth," oh, the good news shout!
“Hath everlasting life."

Many criminals and one crime
One verdict, gonna do some time (and I said)
One ruling to each one
One victim known as the Son Of.
God, Jesus, Emmanuel
Become a man just to pay my bail (and I said)
Prince of Peace, and the King Of Kings
He taught me how to stop, Stop Doin' Those Things
He came to me in my cage
He came in love in the midst of my rage (and I said)
He opened up the door to my cell
And gained a victory o'er the gates of Hell (and I said)
Glory! Glory! Jesus, you loosed the chains for me
And when you died upon the cross the wage of sin was then made free
Oh, you've taken the torture and the punishment that was mine
And you became the Victim of my crime
The Blessed Son of.
He taught me how to stop, Stop Doin' Those Things (x2)

Victim Divine, Thy grace we claim,
While thus Thy precious death we show:
Once offered up a spotless Lamb,
In Thy great temple here below,
Thou didst for all mankind atone,
And standest now before the throne.
Thou standest in the holy place,
As now for guilty sinners slain;
The blood of sprinkling speaks, and prays,
All prevalent for helpless man;
Thy blood is still our ransom found,
And speaks salvation all around.
The smoke of Thy atonement here
Darkened the sun, and rent the veil,
Made the new way to Heaven appear,
And showed the great Invisible;
Well pleased in Thee, our God looked down,
And calls His rebels to a crown.
He still respects Thy sacrifice;
Its savor sweet doth always please:
The offering smokes through earth and skies,
Diffusing life, and joy, and peace;
To these, Thy lower courts, it comes,
And fills them with divine perfumes.
We need not now go up to Heaven,
To bring the long sought Savior down;
Thou art to all already given,
Thou dost e’en now Thy banquet crown:
To every faithful soul appear,
And show Thy real presence here!

Victorious! Victorious!
Christ has arisen glorious;
Where the fun’ral knell was tolled
Be the hymn of triumph rolled,
Let the palm’s green branches wave
O’er the slumber of the grave;
From its gloom victorious,
Christ has risen glorious,
Christ has risen glorious.
Victorious! Victorious!
Christ has arisen glorious;
Where the heavy tomb was sealed
Gates of Paradise revealed,
Where the mourners wept around,
Faith looks up, with glory crowned.
O’er the grave, victorious,
Christ has risen glorious,
Christ has risen glorious.
Victorious! Victorious!
Christ has arisen glorious;
On His brow the conqueror’s wreath,
In His hand the keys of death,
He shall buried hopes restore,
He shall live forevermore.
Over death victorious,
Christ has risen glorious,
Christ has risen glorious.

Hallelujah, what a thought!
Jesus full salvation brought,
Victory, victory.
Let the pow’rs of sin assail,
Heaven’s grace can never fail,
Victory, victory.
Victory, yes, victory.
Hallelujah! I am free,
Jesus gives me victory.
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
He is all in all to me.
I am trusting in the Lord,
I am standing on His Word,
Victory, victory.
I have peace and joy within,
Since my life is free from sin,
Victory, victory.
Shout your freedom ev’rywhere,
His eternal peace declare,
Victory, victory.
Let us sing it here below,
In the face of ev’ry foe,
Victory, victory.
We will sing it on that shore,
When this fleeting life is o’er,
Victory, victory.
Sing it here, ye ransomed throng,
Start the everlasting song:
Victory, victory.

When the hosts of Israel led by God,
Round the walls of Jericho softly trod,
Trusting in the Lord,
They felt the conqueror’s tread,
By faith they saw the victory ahead.
Victory ahead, victory ahead,
Through the blood of Jesus, victory ahead.
Trusting in the Lord, I hear the conqueror’s tread,
By faith I see the victory ahead.
David with a shepherd’s sling and five stones,
Met the giant on the field all alone,
Trusting in the Lord, he knew what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.
Daniel prayed unto the Lord thrice each day,
Then unto the lion’s den led the way,
Trusting in the Lord, he did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.
Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried,
Trusting in the Lord, I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I see the victory ahead.
When like those who’ve gone before to that land,
By death’s river cold and dark I shall stand.
Trusting in the Lord, I will not fear or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead.

They who know the Savior shall in Him be strong,
Mighty in the conflict of the right ’gainst wrong.
This the blessed promise given in God’s Word,
Doing wondrous exploits, they who know the Lord.
Victory! victory! blessed, blood-bought victory!
Victory! victory! vict’ry all the time!
As Jehovah liveth, strength divine He giveth
Unto those who know Him—vict’ry all the time!
In the midst of battle be thou not dismayed,
Tho’ the pow’rs of darkness ’gainst thee are arrayed.
God, thy Strength, is with thee, causing thee to stand,
Heaven’s allied armies wait at thy command.
Brave to bear life’s testing, strong the foe to meet,
Walking like a hero midst the furnace heat,
Doing wondrous exploits with the Spirit’s Sword,
Winning souls for Jesus, praise, O praise the Lord!

Hail Jesus, You're my King
Your life frees me to sing
I will praise You all my days
You're perfect in all Your ways
I will obey Your Word
I want to see Your kingdom come
Not my will but Yours be done
Glory, glory to the Lamb
You take me into the land
We will conquer in Your name
And proclaim that Jesus reigns
Hail Hail Lion of Judah
How powerful You are
Hail Hail Lion of Judah
How wonderful You are
How wonderful You are
How wonderful You are

Soldiers of King Jesus, raise the shout again,
Victory in Jesus, victory!
Marching to the music of the glad ,
Victory in Jesus evermore.
Victory, victory, victory in Jesus!
Sing His overcoming blood, sing the grace that frees us;
Ring it out more boldly, song of faith and cheer,
Till the whole wide world shall hear.
O’er the pow’rs of darkness, o’er the hosts of sin,
Victory in Jesus, victory!
Trusting, watching, praying, we shall surely win,
Victory in Jesus evermore.
Send the happy watchword all along the line,
Victory in Jesus, victory!
Let all error perish, lives the truth divine,
Victory in Jesus evermore.
For His church and kingdom, for each trusting soul,
Victory in Jesus, victory!
From the courts of Heaven joyful paeans roll,
Victory in Jesus evermore.

The burden of my fear and sin
On Christ by faith I roll;
And now I have His peace within
And victory in my soul.
There’s victory in my soul,
Victory in my soul;
I grasp the promises by faith,
There’s victory in my soul.
I know there is a test for me,
A battle to be won;
But God ensures the victory
Before it is begun.
On battlefields of long ago,
When saints have drawn the sword,
Their strength did not o’ercome the foe,
But trusting in the Lord.
While leaning on His arm alone
I cannot know defeat;
The glory shall be all His own
When victory is complete.
E’en death itself I do not fear
Since Christ hath borne its sting;
His presence through the valley drear
Will help us then to sing.

Marching on to battle ’gainst the hosts of wrong,
Following our Captain with a happy song,
Heeding not the many who are loit’ring by,
For victory is nigh, yes, victory is nigh.
Victory is nigh! yes, victory is nigh!
Shout with voice triumphant to the vaulted sky;
Victory is nigh! yes, victory is nigh!
We will win the battle for the King on high.
Shouting loud hosannas as we onward go,
With determination sin to overthrow;
Satan’s hosts are trembling, foes before us fly,
For victory is nigh, yes, victory is nigh.
“Volunteers are wanted," hear the Master say,
Will you be enlisted in the mighty fray?
Ev’ry Christian answer, saying, “Here am I,"
Then victory is nigh, yes, victory is nigh.
Faithful to your duty, halt not by the way,
Keep the banner floating for the King alway,
Great reward He’ll give His soldiers by and by,
For victory is nigh, yes, victory is nigh.

Conquering now and still to conquer, rideth a King in His might;
Leading the host of all the faithful into the midst of the fight;
See them with courage advancing, clad in their brilliant array,
Shouting the Name of their Leader, hear them exultingly say: 
Not to the strong is the battle, not to the swift is the race,
Yet to the true and the faithful vict’ry is promised through grace.
Conquering now and still to conquer, who is this wonderful King?
Whence are the armies which He leadeth, while of His glory they sing?
He is our Lord and Redeemer, Savior and Monarch divine;
They are the stars that forever bright in His kingdom shall shine.
Conquering now and still to conquer, Jesus, Thou Ruler of all,
Thrones and their scepters all shall perish, crowns and their splendor shall 
fall,
Yet shall the armies Thou leadest, faithful and true to the last,
Find in Thy mansions eternal rest, when their warfare is past.

Vile and sinful tho’ my heart may be,
Fully trusting Lord, I come to Thee;
Thou hast pow’r to cleanse and make me free,
I am coming home.
Coming home, coming home,
No longer in the path of sin to roam;
I’m coming home, coming home,
Lord Jesus, I am coming home.
Like a father seeks a wayward child,
Thou hast sought me o’er the desert wild,
Sick and helpless, by my sin defiled,
I am coming home.
Pleading tenderly, His voice I hear,
Why should I refuse a friend so dear?
He will take away my guilt and fear,
I am coming home.
Precious blood of Jesus, may its flow
Cleanse from evil, wash me white as snow;
There is hope alone in Thee, I know,
I am coming home.
Tell my mother what her boy has done,
God has spoken to her wayward son;
To be faithful till my crown is won,
I am coming home.

Virgin-born, we bow before thee:
blessed was the womb that bore thee;
Mary, Mother meek and mild,
blessed was she in her Child.
Blessed was the breast that fed thee;
blessed was the hand that led thee;
blessed was the parent's eye
that watched thy slumbering infancy.
Blessed she by all creation,
who brought forth the world's salvation,
and blessed they, for ever blest,
who love thee most and serve thee best.
Virgin-born, we bow before thee;
blessed was the womb that bore thee;
Mary, Mother meek and mild,
blessed was she in her Child.

Two hands have haunted me for days,
Two hands of slender shape;
All crushed and torn as in the press
Is bruised the purple grape;
At work or meals, at prayer or play,
Those mangled Palms I see,
And a plaintive voice keeps whispering
"These Hands were pierced for thee,"
For me, Sweet Lord! for me?
"Yea, even so, ungrateful child,
These hands were pierced for thee.
Through toils and dangers passing on,
As though a fiery flood;
Two slender feet beside mine own
Mark ev' ry step with blood
The swollen veins so rent with nails,
It breaks my heart to see,
While the same sad voice cries out afresh
"These Feet were pierced for thee."
For me, dear Christ! for me?
"Yea even so rebellious soul
These feet were pierced for thee."
As on they journey to the close,
These wounded feet and mine;
Distincter still the vision grows,
And more and more divine.
For in my Guide's wide open side,
The riven heart I see,
And a tender voice sobs like a psalm
"This heart was pierced for thee"
For me, great God! for me?
"You enter in my love my lamb!
This heart was pierced for thee."

Visit us, Lord, with revival:
Stricken with coldness and death
Where is our hope of survival,
Save in Thy life-giving breath?
Lord, send us revival!
Let it begin now in me!
Gladly dethroning each rival,
Yield I my heart unto Thee.
Sinners in proud exultation,
Lust of the flesh and the eye,
Bent on the soul's desecration
God and His people defy.
Turning aside into byways,
Letting their ardor grow cold,
Many are leaving the highways
Trod by our fathers of old.
O for the breath of the Spirit!
O for the might of His sword,
Leading us on to inherit
All that in Jesus is stored.
Surely 'tis time for revival;
Surely soon dawneth the day;
Soon shall we hail its arrival,
Chasing the shadows away!

The moon shines bright and the stars give a light
A little before the day:
Our mighty Lord He looked on us,
And bade us awake and pray.

I had wandered off from Heaven,
On the mountains cold and gray,
When I heard my Savior calling,
To His lost sheep far away;
How I listened as the tear drops
Coursed adown like falling rain,
While His tender words of promise,
Made my spirit glad again.

Jesus the water of life will give,
Freely, freely, freely;
Jesus the water of life will give,
Freely to those who love Him.
Come to that fountain, oh drink, and live!
Freely, freely, freely;
Come to that fountain, oh, drink and live!
Flowing for those that love Him.

O ye waves of free salvation,
Onward sweep from day to day,
Till all trace of desolation
From our earth is washed away.

I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
There’s no other way but this;
I shall ne’er get sight of the gates of light,
If the way of the cross I miss.

“Which way shall I take?" shouts a voice in the night,
 “I’m a pilgrim awearied, and spent is my light;
And I seek for a palace, that rests on the hill,
But between us, a stream lieth sullen and chill."

Good people all, this Christmas time,
Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done,
In sending His beloved Son.
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas Day;
In Bethlehem upon the morn
There was a blest Messiah born.

The hearse was driven to our door,
It brought a coffin, white as snow;
Such coffins we had seen before,
But never one, concerned us so.
They took the cover from the casque,
And placed a snow white form inside;
We looked once more—it was the last—
On him who once had been our pride.

The whole wide world for Jesus!
This shall our watchword be;
Upon the highest mountain,
Down by the widest sea;
The whole wide world for Jesus!
To Him shall all men bow,
In city or in prairie,
The world for Jesus now!

The whole world was lost
In the darkness of sin,
The Light of the world is Jesus!
Like sunshine at noonday,
His glory shone in.
The Light of the world is Jesus!

The winged herald of the day
Proclaims the morn’s approaching ray:
And Christ the Lord our souls excites,
And so to endless life invites.

The winter’s sleep was long and deep,
But earth is awakened and gay;
For the life ne’er dies that from God doth rise,
And the green comes after the grey.

The wise may bring their learning, the rich may bring 
their wealth,
And some may bring their greatness, and some bring 
strength and health;
We, too, would bring our treasures to offer to the King;
We have no wealth or learning; what shall we children 
bring?

Come, women, wide proclaim
Life through your Savior slain;
Sing evermore.
Christ, God’s effulgence bright,
Christ, Who arose in might,
Christ, Who crowns you with light,
Praise and adore.

O the wonder of the story
Of the night so long ago,
In the glimmer of the starlight
And the whiteness of the snow,
When the little Prince of Judah
In His beauty came to birth,
While the angels sang His glory
And His sweetness filled the earth!

The wond’ring world inquires to know
Why I should love my Jesus so:
 “What are His charms," say they, “above
The objects of a mortal love?"

The Word of God is like a light
That shines serenely thro’ the night;
Its rays will light my weary way
To the realms of a fair, unending day.

A glad message rings through the world today,
It echoes through the countries afar,
That the rising Sun, with celestial ray,
Scatters healing where’er men are.

The world for God! The world for God!
There’s nothing else will meet the hunger of my soul.
I see forsaken children, I see the tears that fall
From women’s eyes once merry, now never laugh at all;
I see the sins and sorrows of those who sit in darkness;
I see in lands far distant, the hungry and oppressed.
But behold! On a hill, Calvary! Calvary!

The world is sad with hopes that die,
With joys that gleam and then go by,
And dim the mortal eyes that gaze
On setting suns of parting days.

The world is very evil, the times are waxing late,
Be sober and keep vigil, the Judge is at the gate.
The Judge Who comes in mercy, the Judge Who comes in might,
Who comes to end the evil, Who comes to crown the right.

The world must be taken for the Lord;
Onward, soldiers, and arm ye for the fight.
 “In His Name" now watch and fight and pray,
Till all foes fear and tremble at the sight.

O wondrous world within a world
How beautiful thou art!
What high desire, what holy fire
Lie glowing at thy heart!
What beauty, like the silent stars,
Hangs ever o’er thy brow;
What youth, as old as Paradise,
Springs deathless in thee now!

O troubled heart, there is a home
Beyond the reach of toil and care;
A home where changes never come:
Who would not fain be resting there?

Wait, O my soul, thy Maker’s will;
Tumultuous passions, all be still!
Nor let a murmuring thought arise;
His ways are just, His counsels wise.

When my final farewell to the world I have said,
 [

Come, Holy Ghost, and touch my tongue
As with a living flame;
I want the sanctifying grace
My Savior bids me claim.

We are waiting, blessed Savior,
We are watching for the hour
When in majesty descending,
Thou shalt come in mighty power;
Then the shadows will be lifted,
And the darkness rolled away,
And our eyes behold the splendor
Of the glorious crowning day.

Waiting on the Lord, for the promise given;
Waiting on the Lord, to send from Heaven;
Waiting on the Lord, by our faith receiving;
Waiting in the upper room.

Wake, awake, for night is flying;
The watchmen on the heights are crying:
Awake, Jerusalem, at last!
Midnight hears the welcome voices
And at the thrilling cry rejoices;
Come forth, ye virgins, night is past;
The Bridegroom comes, awake;
Your lamps with gladness take;
Alleluia! And for His marriage feast prepare
For ye must go and meet Him there.

Wake every tuneful string,
Let every creature sing,
Praise ye, praise ye,
Praise ye the Lord;
Maker of earth and sea,
We lift our hearts to Thee,
With lofty melody;
Praise ye the Lord.

Wake, harp of Zion, wake again,
Upon thine ancient hill,
On Jordan’s long deserted plain,
By Kedron’s lowly rill.

Wake the song of joy and gladness;
Hither bring your noblest lays;
Banish every thought of sadness,
Pouring forth your highest praise.
Sing to Him Whose care has brought us
Once again with friends to meet,
And Whose loving voice has taught us,
Of the way to Jesus’ feet.

Wake the song of jubilee,
Let it echo o’er the sea!
Now is come the promised hour,
Jesus reigns with sov’reign power.
All ye nations, join and sing,
Christ of lords and kings is King.
Let it sound from shore to shore
Jesus reigns forevermore.

Wake, isles of the South! Your redemption is near,
No longer repose in the borders of gloom;
The strength of His chosen in love shall appear,
And light shall arise on the verge of the tomb,
And light shall arise on the verge of the tomb.

Wake, O wake! with tidings thrilling
The watchmen all the air are filling,
Arise, Jerusalem, arise!
Midnight strikes! no more delaying,
“The hour has come!" we hear them saying,
Where are ye all, ye virgins wise?
The Bridegroom comes in sight,
Raise high your torches bright!
Alleluya! The wedding swells loud and strong:
Go forth and join the festal throng!

Low in the grave they had buried Christ the Savior;
Dark was the night round the silent guarded tomb,
But with the dawn came a glow of heav’nly splendor
Glory filled the earth dispelling gloom.

Waken! Christian children,
Up and let us sing,
With glad voice the praises
Of our newborn King.

Waking out of silence rang a heav’nly song,
Darkness giving place to light divine;
Thro’ the gates of Heaven came an angel throng,
Hasting down to join in chant sublime;
Wonderful the music over Bethle’em’s hill!
Wonderful the light that shone around!
 “Glory in the highest," and on earth goodwill!
Earth, attend the glad, angelic sound!

Walk in the beautiful sunshine,
Smiling so cheerful and bright,
Chasing the mist from the mountain,
Flooding the world with its light.
Hark! the sweet voice of the Master
Whispers in accents divine,
“Take thou no thought for the morrow,
Only the present is thine."

Walk in the light: so shalt thou know
That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow
Who reigns in light above.

Walk softly in springtime, to 
hear the grass sing
its whispering carols to Jesus our king;
to see the new flowers bright colors display;
to tell all the children of glad Easter day.
Sing gently in springtime, and join with the birds,
who warble their music, a song without words,
that floats through the air and that reaches the 
sky,
a message of love to the Father on high.
Praise gladly in springtime when earth seems to glow
with new life and color in all things that grow;
for all nature's children are happy to say,
 "Rejoice, for the Savior is risen today."

Walk Thou with me, nor let my footsteps stray
Apart from Thee, throughout life’s threatening way;
Be Thou my Guide, the Path I cannot see;
Close to Thy side, Lord, let me walk with Thee.

When the lowly Jesus trod the paths of men below,
He beheld their bitter sorrow, and their crushing woe;
He received them kindly, when they joined Him on the way,
Graciously He walked and talked with them from day to day.

Walking in sunlight all of my journey;
Over the mountains, through the deep vale;
Jesus has said, 的'll never forsake thee,"
Promise divine that never can fail.

We are traveling on with our staff in hand,
Walking in the good old way;
We are pilgrims bound for the heavenly land,
Walking in the good old way.

We shall see the desert as the rose,
Walking in the King’s highway;
There’ll be singing where salvation goes,
Walking in the King’s highway.

Wand’rer, come, there’s room for thee,
At the cross of Jesus;
Come and taste salvation free
At the cross of Jesus.

Was it for me, the nails, the spear,
The cruel thorns, the mocking jeer,
That rugged cross, ’twixt earth and sky—
Was it for me He came to die?

I have a dear Savior Who loves me, I know,
And Whose will I delight to do;
He’s present to cheer me wherever I go—
Was there ever a friend so true?

Who, who are these beside the chilly wave,
Just on the borders of the silent grave,
Shouting Jesu’s power to save,
 “Washed in the blood of the Lamb"?

Watch and pray that when the Master cometh,
If at morning, noon or night,
He may find a lamp in every window,
Trimmed and burning clear and bright.

Walking on the road to Jerusalem
The time had come to sacrifice again
My two small sons they walked beside me down the 
road
The reason that they came was to watch the lamb
They said, Daddy, daddy what will we see there
There’s so much that we don’t understand
So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham
And then I said dear children watch the lamb
There will be so many in Jerusalem today
We must be sure this little lamb doesn’t run away
And I told them of Moses and Father Abraham
And then I said dear children watch the lamb
When we reached the city I knew something must be 
wrong
There were no joyful worshippers there were no 
joyful worship songs
And I stood there with my children in the midst of 
angry men
Then I heard the crowd cry out,
Let’s crucify Him
We tried to leave the city but we could not get away
Forced to play in this drama a part I did not want 
to play
Why upon this day were men condemned to die
Why were we standing right here where soon they 
would pass by
I look and I said even now they come
The first one cried for mercy, the people gave him 
none
The second one was violent and he was arrogant and 
loud
I still can hear his angry voice screaming at the 
crowd
Then someone said there’s Jesus and I scarce 
believed my eyes
A man so badly beaten He barely looked alive
Blood poured from His body from the thorns on His 
brow
Running down the cross and falling to the ground
I watched Him as He struggled and I watched Him when 
He fell
The cross came down upon His back, the crowd began 
to yell
In that moment I felt such agony in that moment I 
felt such loss
Until a Roman soldier grabbed my arm and screamed 
 "you carry His cross"
At first I tried to resist him but his hand reached 
for his sword
And so I knelt and I took the cross from the Lord
I put it on my shoulder we started down the street
The blood that He’d been shedding was running down 
my cheek
They led us to Golgotha they drove nails deep in His 
feet and hands
On the cross I heard Him pray "Father forgive them"
Never have I seen such love in any other eyes
 "Into They hands I commit My spirit" He prayed and 
then He died
I stood for what seemed like years lost all sense of 
time
Then I felt these little hands holding on to mine
My children stood there weeping and I heard the 
oldest say
Father please forgive us the lamb ran away
Daddy, daddy what have we seen here
There’s so much that we don’t understand
So I took them in my arms we turned and faced the 
cross
And I said dear children Watch the Lamb

Watchman, blow the Gospel trumpet,
Every soul a warning give;
Whosoever hears the message
May repent, and turn and live.

Watchmen on the walls of Zion, what, O tell us, of the night?
Is the day-star now arising? Will the morn soon greet our sight?
O’er your vision shine there now some rays of light?
O’er your vision shine there now some rays of light?

Watchmen! onward to your stations;
Blow the trumpet long and loud;
Preach the Gospel to the nations,
Speak to ev’ry gath’ring crowd.
See the day is breaking;
See the saints awaking,
No more in sadness bow,
No more in sadness bow.

Watchmen! onward to your stations;
Blow the trumpet long and loud;
Preach the Gospel to the nations,
Speak to ev’ry gath’ring crowd.
See the day is breaking;
See the saints awaking,
No more in sadness bow,
No more in sadness bow.

Watchman, tell us of the night,
What its signs of promise are.
Traveler, o’er yon mountain’s height,
See that glory beaming star.
Watchman, does its beauteous ray
Aught of joy or hope foretell?
Traveler, yes—it brings the day,
Promised day of Israel.

I have a dear Savior Who loves me, I know,
And Whose will I delight to do;
He’s present to cheer me wherever I go—
Was there ever a friend so true?

We all believe in one true God,
Who created earth and Heaven,
The Father, Who to us in love
Hath the right of children given.
He both soul and body feedeth,
All we need He doth provide us;
He thro’ snares and perils leadeth,
Watching that no harm betide us.
He careth for us day and night,
All things are governed by His might.

Our lives, we are told, are but fleeting at best,
Like roses they fade and decay;
Then let us do good while the present is ours,
Be useful as long as we stay.

Our school is a vineyard, a garden of truth,
Where all can do something for Jesus;
And though we are just in the morning of youth,
We all can do something for Jesus;
The deep, rolling river that flows to the sea
Is made of the brooklet that sparkles so free;
A lesson, dear children, for you and for me,
We all can do something for Jesus.
The deep, rolling river that flows to the sea
Is made of the brooklet that sparkles so free.

We are a band of merry children,
Full of glee, full of glee,
Like the springtime in its beauty,
Glad are we, glad are we;
Bright is the busy world around us,
Bright with flowers, bright with flowers,
Smiles from the sunny vale above us,
Come with the hours, come with the hours.

We are a garden walled around,
Chosen and made peculiar ground;
A little spot enclosed by grace
Out of the world’s wide wilderness.

We are building in sorrow, and building in 
joy,
A temple the world cannot see;
But we know it will stand if we found it on a 
rock,
Thro’ the ages of eternity.

We are but a band of children,
We are few, and weak and small,
But we want to work for Jesus,
And there’s work enough for all.

We are but little children weak,
Nor born in any high estate;
What can we do for Jesus’ sake,
Who is so high and good and great?

We are climbing Jacob’s ladder,
We are climbing Jacob’s ladder,
We are climbing Jacob’s ladder,
Soldiers of the cross.

We are drifting towards the waters
Of a calm and tranquil sea,
And we soon shall anchor safely
In that port where we should be.

We are gathered for Thy blessing,
We will wait upon our God;
We will trust in Him Who loved us,
And Who bought us with His blood.

We are God's people, the chosen of the Lord, 
Born of His Spirit, established by His Word; 
Our cornerstone is Christ alone, 
And strong in Him we stand: 
O let us live transparently 
And walk heart to heart and hand in hand.

We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
Let's walk the heavenly road
I was livin' me life as an Anglican
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man
I was livin' me life as an Anglican
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man
One night I was walking down Fred'rick street
Poor and hungry no shoes on me feet
I passed a door that said "Down with sin"
It was the smell of food that pull me in
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
Let's walk the heavenly road
Well, the leader walked up and he shook my hand
Said "I want you to be a holy man"
Right away I made a big decision
Me stomach was a growling for this new religion
I started over to get some food
When some sisters approached me in a mystic mood
They dunked me in the water 'bout four five times
I couldn't see a thing 'cause I was almost blind
Singing I've got a sword in my hand
I'm going to use it well
I was drenched to me skin and I was feeling cold
But the sight of the food made me take a hold
The sisters started to break away
They said "Kneel believers kneel and pray"
I prayed and I prayed in a new-found style
In the meantime me taste buds was running wild
I was about to fall clear out of me seat
When a man jumped up and said
"Before you eat
You got to mourn children mourn
You got to mourn children mourn
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die,
You got to mourn children mourn"
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,
Now I find myself a free man again
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,
Now I find myself a free man again
Don't talk 'bout the leaders they treat me good,
Plenty sweet oil and plenty food
Brother it was then that I realized
Ev'ry man on earth should be baptized
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
Let's walk the heavenly road

We are going down the valley one by one,
With our faces tow’rd the setting of the sun;
Down the valley where the mournful cypress grows,
Where the stream of death in silence onward flows.

We are happy sunbeams,
Shining day by day,
Making others happy as we go our way,
Bright’ning gloomy places,
Spreading mirth and cheer,
Always glowing brightly for our Savior dear.

We are little Christians,
And we love our Lord,
We are daily trying
To obey his word;
We will serve our Leader,
Who came down to die
For the little children,
From His home on high.

We are living, we are dwelling, in a grand and awful time,
In an age on ages telling; to be living is sublime.
Hark! the waking up of nations, hosts advancing to the fray;
Hark! what soundeth is creation’s groaning for the latter day.

We are drifting towards the waters
Of a calm and tranquil sea,
And we soon shall anchor safely
In that port where we should be.

We are never, never weary of the grand old song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We can sing it loud as ever, with our faith more strong;
Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord
We are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord
And we pray that all unity may one day be restored
And they'll know we are Christians by our love , by our love
Yes they'll know we are Christians by our love
We will walk with each other
We will walk hand in hand And together we'll spread the news that God is in our land
We will work with each other we will work side by side
And we'll guard each man's dignity and save each man's pride
All praise to the father from whom all things come
And all praise to Christ Jesus his only son
And all praise to the spirit
Who makes all things one.

We are pilgrims of a day,
Homeward bound, homeward bound;
Singing on our cheerful way,
We are homeward bound.

We are so blessed, by the gifts

We are soldiers of Christ, Who is mighty to save,
And His banner the Cross is unfurled;
We are pledged to be faithful and steadfast and brave
Against Satan, the flesh, and the world.

We are the Lord’s; His all sufficient merit,
Sealed on the cross, to us this grace accords.
We are the Lord’s and all things shall inherit;
Whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.

We are tossed and driv’n on the restless sea of time;
Somber skies and howling tempests oft succeed a bright sunshine;
In that land of perfect day, when the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by and by.

We are traveling on with our staff in hand,
Walking in the good old way;
We are pilgrims bound for the heavenly land,
Walking in the good old way.

We are waiting, blessed Savior,
We are watching for the hour
When in majesty descending,
Thou shalt come in mighty power;
Then the shadows will be lifted,
And the darkness rolled away,
And our eyes behold the splendor
Of the glorious crowning day.

We are watching, we are waiting,
For the bright prophetic day;
When the shadows, weary shadows
From the world shall roll away.

’Twas the Lord of hosts that led us out of Egypt’s sand;
And He led us through the Red Sea by His mighty hand,
Never halting in the wilderness, but His command
Gave assurance we were able to possess the land.

We bear the strains of earthly care,
But bear it not alone;
Beside us walks our Brother Christ,
And makes our task His own.

We believe in God the Father,
God almighty, by whose plan
earth and heaven sprang to being,
all created things began.
We believe in Christ the Savior,
Son of God in human frame,
virgin-born, the child of Mary
upon whom the Spirit came.
Christ, who on the cross forsaken,
like a lamb to slaughter led,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
he descended to the dead.
We believe in Jesus risen,
heaven's king to rule and reign,
to the Father's side ascended
till as judge he comes again.
We believe in God the Spirit;
in one church, below, above;
saints of God in one communion,
one in holiness and love.
So by faith, our sins forgiven,
Christ our Savior, Lord and friend,
we shall rise with him in glory
to the life that knows no end.

We bid thee welcome in the name
Of Jesus, our exalted Head.
Come as a servant, so He came,
And we receive thee in His stead.

We bless the Name of Christ, the Lord,
We bless Him for His holy Word,
Who loved to do His Father’s will,
And all His righteousness fulfill.

We bless the Triune God of Might,
Our Sovereign and our Savior,
Who puts our enemies to flight,
And guards us with His favor!
Our song goes up to Him,
Above the seraphim,
Where awestruck angels gaze
At Him, Ancient of Days,
On high He reigns, exalted.

We bring our children, Lord, today
as once they did in Galilee,
embrace them with your love, we pray,
and bless each home and family.
On their behalf and in their name
our own commitment we renew,
with them we die to sin and shame,
with them we live again in you.
Help us in all our ways to show
these growing souls your truth and grace,
till they shall come themselves to know
the beauty of our Father's face.

We build our school on Thee, O Lord,
To Thee we bring our common need;
The loving heart, the helpful word,
The tender thought, the kindly deed.

We cannot build alone; to rear, great God, to Thee,
A house which Thou wilt own, Thou must the builder be.
Not by our might, but Thy power,
Must dome and tower take upward flight,
Must dome and tower take upward flight.

We cannot think of them as dead
Who walk with us no more;
Along the path of life we tread—
They have but gone before.

We Christians may rejoice today
When Christ was born to comfort and to save us.
Who thus believes no longer grieves,
For none are lost who grasp the hope He gave us.

We come again, O gracious Lord,
Around Thy hallowed mercy seat,
To feast upon Thy living Word,
And lay our burdens at Thy feet.

We come before Thy throne today,
Thy promised presence claim;
O come and enter now our hearts,
And set our souls aflame.

We come in childhood’s joyfulness,
We come as children free!
We offer up, O God! our hearts,
In trusting love to Thee.
Well may we bend in solemn joy
At Thy bright courts above:
Well may the grateful child rejoice
In such a Father’s love.

We come, O Christ, to you

We come to this your table, Lord,
unburdened of our sin;
and as we kneel we see again
our free salvation bought with pain
and our new birth begin.
We come to this your table, Lord,
unworthy of your care;
yet love unbounded floods our souls,
confirms our faith, defines our goals,
and speaks of joys to share.
We come to this your table, Lord,
to take the bread and wine;
we go away with thankful hearts
for all the joy this feast imparts,
for this most precious sign.
And far from this your table, Lord,
when anxious cares invade,
help us remember this dear place,
your mighty power, your saving grace,
your table richly laid.

We come unto our fathers’ God,
Their Rock is our Salvation;
Th’eternal arms, their dear abode,
We make our habitation.
We bring Thee, Lord, the praise they brought,
We seek Thee as Thy saints have sought
In every generation.

We come, the Gospel Heralds,
And raise the Standard high!
Behold the sacred banner
Is waving in the sky!

We find many people who can’t understand
Why we are so happy and free.
We’ve crossed over Jordan to Canaan’s fair land,
And this is like Heaven to me.

We give immortal praise
To God the Father’s love,
For all our comforts here,
And better hopes above;
He sent His own eternal Son,
To die for sins that man had done.

We give Thee but Thine own,
Whate’er the gift may be;
All that we have is Thine alone,
A trust, O Lord, from Thee.

We hail Thee now, O Jesu,
Upon Thine altar-throne,
Though sight and touch have failed us,
And faith perceives alone!
Thy love has veiled Thy Godhead
And hid Thy power divine,
In mercy to our weakness,
Beneath an earthly sign.

We have a King who came to earth
to win the world for God,
and we, the children of the King,
must follow where he trod.
The banner that our King unfurled
was love to every man,
so we must try to show that love
in all the ways we can.
The enemies he came to fight
are selfishness and sin:
then who would be a traitor now
and let his foemen in?
He bids us keep our bodies pure,
for 'tis the pure and clean
can see the glory of the King,
and tell what they have seen.
We are a little company,
but we are pledged to bring
pure holy lives, kind joyful hearts,
and bring them to the King.

We have a message, a message from Jesus,
And time now is speeding, the moments are few;
The Master is come, O make haste to receive Him,
For sinners He waits; He is calling for you!

We have a sure prophetic Word,
By inspiration of the Lord;
And though assailed on every hand,
Jehovah’s Word shall ever stand.

Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
When the strong tides lift and the cables strain,
Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?

We Have Come Into His House And Gathered In His Name To Worship Him;
We Have Come Into His House And Gathered In His Name To Worship Him;
We Have Come Into His House And Gathered In His Name To Worship Christ The Lord;
Worship Him, Christ The Lord.
Let’s For-get About Ourselves And Concentrate On Him, And Worship Him.
Let’s Forget About Ourselves And Concentrate On Him, And Worship Him.
Let’s Forget About Ourselves And Concentrate On Him, And Worship Christ The Lord.
Worship Him, Christ The Lord.

We have heard the joyful sound: Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around: Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to every land, climb the mountains, cross the waves;
Onward! ’tis our Lord’s command; Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

We have not known Thee as we ought,
Nor learned Thy wisdom, grace and power;
The things of earth have filled our thought,
And trifles of the passing hour.
Lord, give us light Thy truth to see,
And make us wise in knowing Thee.

We have not seen, we cannot see,
The happy land above,
From sin and death and suffering free,
Where all is peace and love.

We have this hope that burns within our hearts,
Hope in the coming of the Lord.
We have this faith that Christ alone imparts,
Faith in the promise of His Word.
We believe the time is here,
When the nations far and near
Shall awake, and shout and sing
Hallelujah! Christ is King!
We have this hope that burns within our hearts,
Hope in the coming of the Lord.

We hope in Thee, O God!
The day wears on to night;
Thick shadows lie across our world,
In Thee alone is light.

We journey through a vale of tears,
By many a cloud o’ercast;
And worldly cares and worldly fears,
Go with us to the last.

We knelt before kings; we bent before lords;
For theirs were the crowns, and theirs were the swords:
But times of the bending and bowing are past,
The day of the people is dawning at last!

We know not the trials before us,
But Jesus takes thought for them all,
And trusting the aid of His counsel,
We never, no, never can fall;
We know not the trials before us,
Or what on the morrow may be,
But sweet is the soul cheering promise,
“My grace is sufficient for thee."

We know Thee Who Thou art,
Lord Jesus, Mary’s Son;
We know the yearnings of Thy heart
To end Thy work begun.

We leave Thy house, but leave not Thee,
For Thou wilt ever with us be;
For time nor space can us divide,
Or take us from our Shepherd’s side.

We lift our hearts in thanks today
For all the gifts of life;
And first, for peace that turns away
The enemies of strife;

We lift our hearts, O Father,
to thee, our voices raise,
for these thy suppliant servants,
in mingled prayer and praise:
Praise for the joy of loving,
all other joys above,
praise for the priceless blessing
of love's response to love;
Prayer that the sweet surrender
of self may perfect be,
that each be one with other,
and both be one in thee;
Prayer that the bond between them
may be as closely tied
as is the bond that bindeth
Christ and his holy Bride;
Prayer that thou wilt accomplish
the promise of today,
and crown the years with blessing
that shall pass away;
Praise for the hope most glorious
that looks beyond the veil,
where faith and hope shall vanish,
but love shall never fail.

We lift our hearts to Thee,
O Day Star from on high!
The sun itself is but Thy shade,
Yet cheers both earth and sky.

We limit not the truth of God
To our poor reach of mind,
By notions of our day and sect,
Crude, partial, and confined.
No, let a new and better hope
Within our hearts be stirred:

We love the place, O God,
Wherein Thine honor dwells;
The joy of Thine abode
All earthly joy excels.

We love the venerable house
Our fathers built to God;
In heaven are kept their grateful vows,
Their dust endears the sod.

We love Thee, Lord, and we adore;
Now is Thine arm revealed:
Thou art our strength, our heav’nly tower,
Our bulwark and our shield.

We may not climb the heavenly steeps
To bring the Lord Christ down;
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For Him no depths can drown.

We may tarry awhile here as strangers,
Unnoticed by those who pass by;
But the Savior will crown us in glory,
To shine as the stars in the sky.

We now have met to worship Thee,
And glorify Thy Name, dear Lord;
Help every one attentive be,
And heed the teaching of Thy Word.
Fill every heart with love divine,
Teach every tongue Thy praise to sing.

We now implore the Holy Ghost
For the true faith, which we need the most,
That in our last moments He may befriend us
And, as homeward we journey, attend us.
Lord, have mercy.

We plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land,
But it is fed and watered by God’s almighty hand;
He sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain,
The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain.

We praise thee, Lord, for all the martyred throng,
Those who by fire and sword or suffering long
Laid down their lives, but would not yield to wrong:
Alleluia!
For those who fought to keep the faith secure,
For all whose hearts were selfless, strong and pure,
For those whose courage taught us to endure:
Alleluia!
For fiery spirits, held and God-controlled,
For gentle natures by his power made bold,
For all whose gracious lives God's love retold.
Alleluia!
Thanks be to thee, O Lord, for saints unknown,
Who by obedience to thy word have shown
That thou didst call and mark them for thine own.
Alleluia!

We praise Thee, O God, our Lord and our King,
Accept Thou the praise we gratefully bring;
Thanksgiving and worship we offer to Thee,
Thou Ruler of nations, in Whom we are free.

We praise Thee, O God!
For the Son of Thy love,
For Jesus Who died,
And is now gone above.

We praise thy Name, O Lord most high,
Redeemer of our souls from death,
and all thy mercies magnify,
in making known thy saving faith.
Thou didst the humble fisher call
beside the shores of Galilee:
at thy command he gave up all,
and left his nets to follow thee.
O happy choice, for earthly toil
the strife to rescue souls from sin;
for treasures that may rust and spoil,
the crown of heavenly life to win.
O favored one, who, ere he knew
the sharpness of the coming cross,
of thy bright beauty caught the view
that turns to gain all earthly loss.
Thy promise is fulfilled, and he
dares in thy painful steps to go:
to drink thy cup of agony,
and drain the bitter dregs of woe.
Grant, Lord, that hope of seeing thee
in bliss, may us with courage nerve,
the world and all its pomp to flee,
our cross to bear, and thee to serve.

We praise Thy Name, all-holy Lord,
For him, the beacon-light
That shone beside our western sea
Through mists of ancient night;
Who sent to Ireland’s fainting church
New tidings of Thy Word:
For David, prince of Cambrian saints,
We praise Thee, holy Lord.

We praise, we worship thee, O God,
Thy sovereign power we sound abroad;
All nations bow before thy throne,
And thee the eternal Father own,
Loud alleluias to thy name
Angels and seraphim proclaim;
The heavens and all the powers on high
With rapture constantly do cry:
'O holy, holy, holy Lord,
Thou God of hosts, by all adored,
Earth and the heavens are full of thee,
Thy light, thy power, thy majesty.'
Apostles join the glorious throng,
And swell the loud immortal song;
Prophets enraptuered hear the sound,
And spread the alleluia round.
Victorious martyrs join their lays,
And shout the omnipotence of grace;
While all thy church through all the earth
Acknowledge and extol thy worth.

We pray for peace,
but not the easy peace
built on complacency
and not the truth of God.
We pray for real peace,
the peace God's love alone can seal.
We pray for peace,
but not the cruel peace,
leaving God's poor bereft
and dying in distress,
we pray for real peace,
enriching all the human race.
We pray for peace,
and not the evil peace,
defending unjust laws
and nursing prejudice,
but for the real peace
of justice, mercy, truth and love.
We pray for peace:
holy communion
with Christ our risen Lord
and every living thing;
God's will fulfilled on earth
and all his creatures reconciled.
We pray for peace,
and for the sake of peace,
look to the risen Christ
who gives the grace we need,
to serve the cause of peace
and make our own self-sacrifice.
God, give us peace:
if you withdraw your love,
there is no peace for us
nor any hope of it.
With you to lead us on,
through death or tumult, peace will come.

We pray Thee, heavenly Father, to hear us in Thy love,
And pour upon Thy children the unction from above;
That so in love abiding, from all defilement free,
We may in pureness offer our Eucharist to Thee.

We rear not a temple, like Judah’s of old,
Whose portals were marble, whose vaultings were gold;
No incense is lighted, no victims are slain,
No monarch kneels praying to hallow the fane.

We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!
We go not forth alone against the foe;
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.

We saw Thee not when Thou didst come
To this poor world of sin and death;
Nor yet beheld Thy cottage home,
In that despised Nazareth.
But we believe Thy footsteps trod
Its streets and plains, Thou Son of God.
But we believe Thy footsteps trod
Its streets and plains, Thou Son of God.

We shall all clasp hands in glory by and by;
We shall tell redemption’s story by and by;
When the voyage of life is past
We shall reach the port at last,
And our anchor safely cast by and by.

We shall meet in the Eden above,
In that beautiful land of the blest;
All our trials and pains will be o’er,
When we enter that mansion of rest.
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
In the beautiful, beautiful Eden above,
All our trials and pains will be o’er,
When we enter that mansion of rest.

We shall reach the river side
Some sweet day, some sweet day;
We shall cross the stormy tide
Some sweet day, some sweet day;
We shall press the sands of gold,
While before our eyes unfold
Heaven’s splendors, yet untold,
Some sweet day, some sweet day.

We shall reach the summer land,
Some sweet day, by and by;
We shall press the golden strand,
Some sweet day, by and by;
Oh, the loved ones watching there,
By the tree of life so fair,
Till we come their joy to share,
Some sweet day, by and by.

When the Lord from Heav’n appears,
When are banished all our fears,
When the sleepers from the tomb,
With the watchers reach their home.

We shall see His lovely face

We shall see the desert as the rose,
Walking in the King’s highway;
There’ll be singing where salvation goes,
Walking in the King’s highway.

There’s a blessed time that’s coming, coming soon (coming soon),
It may be evening, morning or at noon (or at noon),
The wedding of the bride, united with the Groom,
We shall see the King when He comes.

Though the way we journey may be often drear,
We shall see the King some day;
On that blessed morning clouds will disappear;
We shall see the King some day.

We may tarry awhile here as strangers,
Unnoticed by those who pass by;
But the Savior will crown us in glory,
To shine as the stars in the sky.

We shall sleep, but not forever,
There will be a glorious dawn!
We shall meet to part, no, never,
On the resurrection morn!
From the deepest cave of ocean,
From the desert and the plain,
From the valley and the mountain,
Countless throngs shall rise again.

We shall walk with Him in white,
In that country pure and bright,
Where shall enter naught that may defile;
Where the day-beam ne’er declines,
For the blessed light that shines
Is the glory of a Savior’s smile.

We sing for all the unsung saints,
that countless, nameless throng,
who kept the faith and passed it on,
with hope steadfast and strong,
through all the daily griefs and joys
no chronicles record,
forgetful of their lack of fame,
but mindful of the Lord.
Though uninscribed with date or place,
with title, rank, or name,
as living stones their stories join
to form a hallowed frame
around the mystery in their midst:
the Lamb once sacrificed,
the Love that wrested life from death,
the wounded, risen Christ.
So we take heart from unknown saints
bereft of earthly fame,
those faithful ones who have received
a more enduring name:
for they reveal true blessing comes
when we our pride efface
and offer back our lives to be
the vessels of God's grace.

We sing His love, Who once was slain,
Who soon o’er death revived again,
That all His saints through Him might have
Eternal conquests o’er the grave.

We sing, Immanuel, Thy praise,
Thou Prince of Life and Fount of grace,
Thou Flower of heaven and Star of morn,
Thou Lord of lords, Thou virgin born.
Hallelujah!

We sing of a land where the servants of God
Shall meet when their journey is o’er,
And clasp their glad hands as they gather at morn,
To labor and sorrow no more.

We sing of God, the mighty source
of all things; the stupendous force
on which all strength depends;
from whose right arm, beneath whose eyes,
all period, power and enterprise
commences, reigns and ends.
Tell them I AM, the Lord God said,
to Moses while on earth in dread
and smitten to the heart,
at once, above, beneath, around,
all nature without voice or sound
replied, O Lord, thou art.
Glorious the sun in mid career;
glorious the assembled fires appear;
glorious the comet's train:
glorious the trumpet and alarm;
glorious the almighty stretched-out arm;
glorious the enraptured main:
Glorious, most glorious, is the crown
of him that brought salvation down
by meekness, called man's son;
seers that stupendous truth believed,
and now the matchless deeds achieved,
determined, dared and done.

We sing the almighty power of God,
Who bade the mountains rise,
Who spread the flowing seas abroad
And built the lofty skies.

We sing the glorious conquest,
Before Damascus’ gate,
When Saul, the Church’s spoiler,
Came breathing threats and hate;
The rav’ning wolf rushed forward
Full early to the prey;
But lo! the Shepherd met him,
And bound him fast today.

We sing the praise of Him Who died,
Of Him Who died upon the cross;
The sinner’s hope let men deride,
For this we count the world but loss.

We speak of the realms of the blest,
That country so bright and so fair,
And oft are its glories confessed—
But what must it be to be there!
We speak of its pathway of gold—
Its walls decked with jewels so rare,
Its wonders and pleasures untold—
But what must it be to be there!

We talk of the realms of the bless’d,
That country so bright and so fair,
And oft are its glories confess’d,
But what must it be to be there!

We thank Thee, O our Father,
For all Thy loving care;
We thank Thee that Thou madest
The world so bright and fair.
We thank Thee for the sunshine,
And for the pleasant showers;
And O, our God, we thank Thee,
We thank Thee for the flowers.

We thank Thee, O our Father,
For all Thy loving care;
We thank Thee that Thou madest
The world so bright and fair.
We thank Thee for the sunshine,
And for the pleasant showers;
And O, our God, we thank Thee,
We thank Thee for the flowers.

We thank Thee, Jesus, dearest Friend,
That Thou didst into Heav’n ascend.
O blessed Savior, bid us live
And strength to soul and body give.
Hallelujah!

We thank Thee, Lord, for this fair earth,
The glittering sky, the silver sea;
For all their beauty, all their worth,
Their light and glory, come from Thee.

We thank Thee, Lord, Thy paths of service lead
To blazoned heights and down the slopes of need;
They reach Thy throne, encompass land and sea,
And he who journeys in them walks with Thee.

We thank You, Lord, and worship You with gladness;
We praise Your Name and lift our hearts in song;
For You are good, Your love endures forever,
Your faithfulness continues all day long.
You’ve lavished us with every spiritual blessing;
We thank You, Lord, and praise You now in song.

We three kings of Orient are;
Bearing gifts we traverse afar,
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.

We wait for a great and glorious day,
As many as love the Lord,
When shadows shall flee, and clouds pass away,
And weeping no more be heard.

We walk by faith, and oh, how sweet
The flow’rs that grow beneath our feet
And fragrance breathe along the way
That leads the soul to endless day.

We walk by faith, and not by sight;
No gracious words we hear
From Him Who spake as man ne’er spake;
But we believe Him near.

We now walk thru the valley and shadow,
Thru a world full of labor and strife;
But some day we shall walk with our Savior
Robed in everlasting life.

We welcome glad Easter when Jesus arose,
And won a great victory over His foes.
Then raise your glad voices, all Christians and sing,
Bring glad Easter tidings to Jesus, your King.
We tell how the women came early that day,
And there at the tomb found the stone rolled away.
Then raise your glad voices, all Christians and sing,
Bring glad Easter tidings to Jesus, your King.
We sing of the angel who said: “Do not fear!
Your Savior is risen, and He is not here."
Then raise your glad voices, all Christians and sing,
Bring glad Easter tidings to Jesus, your King.
We think of the promise which Jesus did give:
 “That he who believes in Me also shall live!"
Then raise your glad voices, all Christians and sing,
Bring glad Easter tidings to Jesus, your King.

We welcome with delight
Another happy day,
Our hearts like merry bells
Ring out the silver lay;
We catch the rosy beams
Reflected from the eye
Of Him Whose wonders fill the earth,
Whose glory fills the sky.

We will exalt you, our God the King;
For ever we will bless your name.
Your praises we will forever sing,
Each day we will extol your fame.

We will follow Jesus,
Though we may be small;
Gladly may we listen
To His loving call.

Savior, where Thou leadest,
We will follow Thee;
Where Thy lambs Thou feedest,
We will follow Thee;
By Thy loving smile attended,
By Thy gentle hand defended,
Till this mortal life is ended,
We will follow Thee.

Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
Why we pull away from each other so easily,
Even though we're all walking the same road
Yet we build dividing walls between
Our brothers and ourselves.
But I, I don't care what label you may wear
If you believe in Jesus you belong with me.
The bond we share is all I care to see
And we'll change the world forever
If you will join with me,
Join and sing, sing,
You're my brother, you're my sister,
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes.
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side.
So long as there is love,
We will stand.
The day will come when we will be as one,
And with a mighty voice together
we will proclaim that Jesus
Jesus is King.
It will echo through the earth;
It will shake the nations,
And the world will see,
See that you're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes.
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side.
So long as there is love,
We will stand.
Take me by the hand,
Join with me.
Join and see - yeah.
You're my brother, you're my sister,
So take me by the hand.
Together we will work until He comes.
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side.
As long as there is love,
We will stand
You're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes.
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side.
So long as there is love,
We will stand.

We worship Thee, almighty Lord,
Our hearts revere Thy gracious Word
When it goes forth from Heav’n o’er all the earth.
Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O God!

We would see Jesus; for the shadows lengthen
Across this little landscape of our life;
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
For the last weariness, the final strife.

We would see Jesus; lo! His star is shining
Above the stable while the angels sing;
There in a manger on the hay reclining;
Haste, let us lay our gifts before the King.

Weary burdened wand’rer,
There is rest for thee,
At the feet of Jesus,
In His love so free;
Listen to His message,
Words forever blest,
Oh, thou heavy laden,
“Come to Me and rest."

Weary child, thy sin forsaking,
Close thy heart no more;
From thy dream of pleasure waking,
Open wide the door.

Weary gleaner, whence comest thou,
With empty hands and clouded brow?
Plodding along thy lonely way,
Tell me, where hast thou gleaned today?
Late I found a barren field,
The harvest past, my search revealed.
Others golden sheaves had gained,
Only stubble for me remained.

Weary of earth, and laden with my sin,
I look at Heav’n and long to enter in,
But there no evil thing may find a home:
And yet I hear a voice that bids me “Come."

Weary of wandering from my God,
And now made willing to return
I hear and bow me to the rod
For thee, not without hope, I mourn:
I have an Advocate above
A Friend before the throne of love.

Weary souls, who wander wide
From the central point of bliss,
Turn to Jesus crucified,
Fly to those dear wounds of His:
Sink into the purple flood;
Rise into the life of God.

Weep not for a brother deceased;
Our loss is his infinite gain;
A soul out of prison released,
And freed from its bodily chain;
With songs let us follow his flight,
And mount with his spirit above,
Escaped to the mansions of light,
And lodged in the Eden of love.

Weep not for Him Who onward bears
His cross to Calvary;
He does not ask man’s pitying tears,
Who wills for man to die.

Like a bird on the deep, far away from its nest,
I had wandered, my Savior, from Thee,
But Thy dear loving voice called me home to Thy breast,
And I knew there was welcome for me.

Come, join our throng today,
Come children, come to Sabbath School;
We learn to sing and pray,
Our rule the golden rule.

We have met once more, in the Master’s Name;
Let us all to Him draw near;
With a trusting faith and a steadfast hope,
For we know our Lord is here.

Welcome, day of sweet repose!
Blessed be thy sacred hours!
We would trust the One Who knows
All our weak and failing powers.

Welcome, delightful morn,
Thou day of sacred rest!
I hail thy kind return;
Lord, make these moments blest;
From the low train of mortal toys,
I soar to reach immortal joys,
I soar to reach immortal joys.

“Welcome, happy morning!" age to age shall say:
“Hell today is vanquished, Heav’n is won today!"
Lo! the dead is living, God forevermore!
Him, their true Creator, all His works adore!

We are gathered today in our Sunday school,
With our hearts full of grateful praise;
We rejoice, we rejoice, as we hither come,
That the Lord doth direct our ways.

Welcome, Thou Victor in the strife,
Welcome from out the grave;
Today we triumph in Thy life
Around Thy empty grave;
Today we triumph in Thy life
Around Thy empty grave.

Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
To the world in kindness giv’n;
Welcome to the humble breast,
As the beaming light from Heav’n.

Gird on, gird on your armor, and away,
Like heroes be firm and true;
Lead on your ranks to battle for the Lord,
Who triumphed over death and the grave for you.

We'll build on the Rock, the living Rock,
On Jesus, the Rock of Ages;
So shall we abide the fearful shock,
When loud the tempest rages.

Behold the hands stretched out for aid,
Darkened by sin and sore dismayed;
Oh, will you to their rescue go,
Lost wand’rers down to endless woe?

We’ll give our hearts to Jesus,
And learn His Name to praise,
The blessed Bible tells us,
How pleasant are His ways.
We’ll give our hearts to Jesus,
In sunny childhood’s hours,
Where life is like the springtime
And full of buds and flowers.

With friends on earth we meet in gladness,
While swift the moments fly,
Yet ever comes the tho’t of sadness,
That we must say, “Goodbye."

If Jesus leads this army,
We will outshine the sun,
We will outshine the sun,
We will outshine the sun;
If Jesus leads this army,
We will outshine the sun,
And we'll walk the golden streets on high.

We’ll stand by the Bible, God’s message to man,
Revealing His love in Redemption’s great plan;
It tells how death entered with sin and the fall,
Of life freely offered through Jesus to all.

Tho' shadows deepen, and my heart bleeds,
I will not question the way He leads;
This side of Heaven we know in part,
I will not question a broken heart.We'll talk it over in the bye and bye.
We'll talk it over, my Lord and I.
I'll ask the reasons - He'll tell me why,
When we talk it over in the bye and bye.
I'll trust His leading, He'll never fail,
Thru darkest tunnels or misty vales.
Obey his bidding and faithful be,
Tho' only one step ahead I see.
We'll talk it over in the bye and bye.
We'll talk it over, my Lord and I.
I'll ask the reasons - He'll tell me why,
When we talk it over in the bye and bye.
I'll hide my heartache behind a smile
And wait for reasons 'til after while.
And tho' He try me, I know I'll find
That all my burdens are silver lined.
We'll talk it over in the bye and bye.
We'll talk it over, my Lord and I.
I'll ask the reasons - He'll tell me why,
When we talk it over in the bye and bye.

Trials

O land of rest, for thee I sigh!
When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armor by
And dwell in peace at home?

We’re “counting" the blessings, our joys we record,
The wonderful mercies like sunbeams outpoured;
But let us remember while praising the Lord,
Somebody else needs a blessing.

We’re going home, no more to roam,
No more to sin and sorrow;
No more to wear the brow of care,
We’re going home tomorrow.

We’re looking for His coming, in the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, when midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ on His throne.

Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.

We’re told in the Bible that Jesus is coming,
Be ready to go, be ready to go!
When He shall descend from the portals of glory,
Be ready to go, be ready to go!

We’ve a story to tell to the nations,
That shall turn their hearts to the right,
A story of truth and mercy,
A story of peace and light,
A story of peace and light.

We’ve been told a joyful thing,
News for all the nations.
Angels have been heard to sing
Round the shepherd stations,
One intoned the “Gloria,"
Others “Alleluia";
Peace to all things human;
War no more for true man.

There is coming a day,
When no heart aches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky,
No more tears to dim the eye,
All is peace forever more,
On that happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day that will be.
What a day that will be,
When my Jesus I shall see,
And I look upon His face,
The One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through the Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day that will be.
There'll be no sorrow there,
No more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain,
No more parting over there;
And forever I will be,
With the One who died for me,
What a day, glorious day that will be.
What a day that will be,
When my Jesus I shall see,
And I look upon His face,
The One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through the Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day that will be

What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

O my Redeemer,
What a Friend Thou art to me!
Oh, what a refuge I have found in Thee!
When the way was dreary,
And my heart was sore oppressed,
 ’Twas Thy voice that lulled me
To a calm sweet rest.

What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.

On that bright and golden morning, when the Son of Man shall come,
And the radiance of His glory we shall see;
When from ev’ry clime and nation He shall call His people home,
What a gath’ring of the ransomed that will be!

What a Mercy of Mercies Is This!
No tongue can e'er express
Such unspeakable bliss!
Jesus died to redeem His lost race.
What will, Oh! What will become of me My doom I plainly see If death approaches me,
And the Savior's not found in my heart?
But welcome, most welcome death to me!
I claim the victory;
For Christ has set me free,
If the Savior is found in my heart.
Farewell to affliction and pain!
I soon with Christ shall reign!
For dying is my gain,
If the Savior is found in my heart.
Now we hope, yes, we hope soon to meet,
And our joys be complete,
There to worship at His feet,
And to reign with the Savior above.

What a Savior Jesus is!
He is mine, and I am His;
He the price of sin has paid,
And for me atonement made.

Bethlehem, Calvary, Olivet, tell,
Oh, what a Savior is mine!
Mountain and plain with His praises shall swell,
Oh, what a Savior is mine!

What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Christ has for sin atonement made
What a wonderful Savior!
We are redeemed, the price is paid
What a wonderful Savior!

What am I, O Thou glorious God!
And what my father’s house to Thee,
That Thou such mercies hast bestowed
On me, the chief of sinners, me!
I take the blessing from above,
And wonder at Thy boundless love.

What are these that glow from afar,
These that lean over the golden bar,
Strong as the lion, pure as the dove,
With open arms, and hearts of love?
They the blessed ones gone before,
They the blessed for evermore;
Out of great tribulation they went
Home to their home of Heaven content.

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

What Cheering Words are These?
Their sweetness who can tell?
In time and in eternity
 'Tis with the righteous well.
In ev'ry state secure
Kept by Jehovah's eye
 'Tis well with them while life endures,
And well when called to die.
'Tis well when joys arise,
 'Tis well when sorrows flow;
 'Tis well when darkness veils the skies,
And strong temptations blow.
'Tis well when on the mount
They feast on saving love;
And 'tus as well in God's account
When they the furnace prove.
'Tis well when at his throne
They wrestle, weep, and pray;
 'Tis well when at his feet they groan,
Yet bring their wants away.

What Child is this who, laid to rest
On Mary’s lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

O listen to our wondrous story,
Counted once among the lost;
Yet One came down from Heaven’s glory,
Saving us at awful cost!

What do I owe? Nay, Lord, what do I not?
All that I am and all that I have got.
All that I am and that how small a thing
compared with all thy goodly fostering.
What do I owe to all the world around?
To set thee first, that grace may more abound.
To set thee first , to hold thee all in all,
and, come what may, to follow thy high call.
What do I owe to this dear land of ours?
All of my best, my time, my thought, my powers.
All of my best is yet to small to give,
that this our land may to thine increase live.
What do I owe to those who follow on?
To build more sure the freedom we have won.
To build more sure the Kingdoms of thy grace,
Kingdoms secure in truth and righteousness.
What do I owe to Christ, my Lord, my King?
That all my life be one sweet offering.
That all my life to noblest heights aspire,
that all I do be touched with holy fire.

What equal honors shall we bring
To Thee, O Lord our God, the Lamb,
When all the notes that angels sing
Are far inferior to Thy Name?

God hath not promised skies always blue,
Flower strewn pathways all our lives through;
God hath not promised sun without rain,
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above,
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.
God hath not promised we shall not know
Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
He hath not told us we shall not bear
Many a burden, many a care.
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above,
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.
God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,
Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;
Never a mountain rocky and steep,
Never a river turbid and deep.
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above,
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.

God hath not promised skies always blue,
Flower strewn pathways all our lives through;
God hath not promised sun without rain,
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.

What God ordains is always good;
His will abideth holy.
As He directs my life for me,
I follow meek and lowly.
God indeed in every need
Doth well know how to shield me;
To Him, then, I will yield me.

What happy men, or angels, these,
That all their robes are spotless white?
Whence did this glorious troop arrive
At the pure realms of heav’nly light?

What I am, Thine eye can see,
Yet I come, O Lord, to Thee.
Though my sins are crimson red,
Yet for me Thy blood was shed.

Jesus is coming to earth again; what if it were today?
Coming in power and love to reign; what if it were today?
Coming to claim His chosen Bride, all the redeemed and purified,
Over this whole earth scattered wide; what if it were today?

Jesus the Lord laid His glory aside,
Sinners to save and make whole,
Freely He died our transgressions to hide,
What is He worth to your soul?

What is our calling’s glorious hope,
But inward holiness?
For this to Jesus I look up;
I calmly wait for this.

What is the song the angels sing?
Sweetly sing, gladly sing;
What is the song the angels sing,
On a Christmas morning?
O, “Peace on earth," the angels sing,
Sweetly sing, gladly sing,
O, “Peace on earth," the angels sing,
On a Christmas morning.

What is the thing of greatest price,
The whole creation round?
That which was lost in Paradise,
That which in Christ is found:

What is the world to me,
With all its vaunted pleasure
When Thou, and Thou alone,
Lord Jesus, art my Treasure!
Thou only, dearest Lord,
My soul’s Delight shalt be;
Thou art my Peace, my Rest—
What is the world to me?

What is our calling’s glorious hope,
But inward holiness?
For this to Jesus I look up;
I calmly wait for this.

What joy there is in coming
To God’s own courts so fair,
Where faithful souls are blooming
Like lilies in His care!
They raise their chalices tender
For Heav’n’s refreshing dew,
 ’Mid blessings God doth render
They life and strength renew.
 ’Mid blessings God doth render
They life and strength renew.

What means this eager, anxious throng,
Which moves with busy haste along—
These wondrous gath’rings day by day,
What means this strange commotion, pray?
In accents hushed the throng reply,
 “Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
In accents hushed the throng reply,
 “Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

“What means this glory round our feet,"
The Magi mused, “more bright than morn!"
And voices chanted clear and sweet,
“Today the Prince of Peace is born!"
“What means this star," the shepherds said,
“That brightens through the rocky glen?"
And angels answering overhead,
Sang “Peace on earth, good will to men!"

“What must I do?" the trembling jailer cried,
When dazed by fear and wonder;
 “Believe in Christ!" was all that Paul replied,
 “And you shall be saved from sin."

There flows from Calvary a stream
For every sinner’s pain,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never thirst again.

What our Father does is well;
Blessed truth His children tell!
Though He send, for plenty, want,
Though the harvest-store be scant,
Yet we rest upon His love,
Seeking better things above.

What raised the wondrous thought,
Or who did it suggest,
That blood-bought saints to glory brought
Should with the Son be blest?

What shall I do, my God to love,
My loving God to praise!
The length, and breadth, and height to prove
And depth of sovereign grace?

O! what shall I do to be saved
From the sorrows that burden my soul?
Like the waves in the storm
When the winds are at war,
Chilling floods of distress o’er me roll.
What shall I do? what shall I do?
O! what shall I do to be saved?

What shall I render to my God
For all His mercy’s store?
I’ll take the gifts He hath bestowed,
And humbly ask for more.

What shall I render to my God
For all His kindness shown?
My feet shall visit Thine abode,
My songs address Thy throne.

What shall I render to the Lord
For all His benefits to me?
How shall my soul, by grace restored,
Give worthy thanks, O Lord, to Thee?

Sowing the seed by the daylight fair,
Sowing the seed by the noonday glare,
Sowing the seed by the fading light,
Sowing the seed in the solemn night:
O what shall the harvest be?
O what shall the harvest be?

What shall we offer our good Lord,
Poor nothings, for his boundless grace?
Fain would we his great name record
And worthily set forth his praise.
Great object of our growing love,
To whom our more than all we owe,
Open the fountain from above,
And let it our full souls o'erflow.
Open a door which earth and hell
May strive to shut, but strive in vain;
Let thy word richly in us dwell,
And let our gracious fruit remain.
O multiply the sower's seed!
And fruit we every hour shall bear,
Throughout the world thy gospel spread,
Thy everlasting truth declare.
So shall our lives thy power proclaim,
Thy grace for every sinner free;
Till all mankind shall learn thy name,
Shall all stretch our their hands to thee.

What shall we say? If God indeed is for us,
Who then can ever come against our souls?
God did not spare His only Son, our Savior,
But gave Him up that we might be made whole.
How will He not, along with Christ our Lord,
Give us all things by His free grace?
God will indeed, along with Christ our Lord,
Give us all things by His free grace.

What star is this, with beams so bright,
More lovely than the noonday light?
 ’Tis sent to announce a newborn King,
Glad tidings of our God to bring.

What sweet of life endureth
unmixed with bitter pain?
 'Midst earthly change and chances
what glory doth remain?
All is a feeble shadow,
a dream that will not stay;
death cometh in a moment,
and taketh all away.
O Christ, a light transcendent
shines in thy countenance,
and none can tell the sweetness,
the beauty of thy glance.
In this may thy poor servant

What thanks and praise to Thee we owe,
O Priest and Sacrifice divine,
For Thy dear saint through whom we know
So many a gracious word of Thine;

What this host? This mighty army,
Conquering every prince of men?
Led by what high King, what champion?
Who, once dead, now lives again?

What This That Steals, That Steals Upon My Frame?
Is it death? Is it death?
That soon shall quench, shall quench this vital flame?
Is it death? Is it death?
If this be death I soon shall be
From every pain and sorrow free,
I shall the King of glory see,
All is well, all is well.
Weep not, my friends, my friends, weep not for me,
All is well, all is well;
My sins are pardoned, pardoned, I am free,
All is well, all is well;
There's not a cloud that doth arise,
To hide my Savior from mine eyes,
I soon shall mount the upper skies,
All is well, all is well.
Tune, tune your harps, your harps, ye saints in glory,
All is well, all is well;
I will rehearse, rehearse the pleasing story,
All is well, all is well;
Bright angels are from glory come,
They're round my bed, they're in my room,
They wait to waft my spirit home,
All is well, all is well.
Hark! Hark! My Lord, my Lord and Master calls me,
All is well, all is well;
I soon shall see, shall see His face in glory,
All is well, all is well;
Farewell, dear friends, adieu, adieu,
I can no longer stay with you,
My glitt'ring crown appears in view,
All is well, all is well.
Hail, hail, all hail, all hail, ye blood-washed throng,
Saved by grace, saved by grace;
I've come to join, to join your rapt'rous songs,
Saved by grace, saved by grace;
All, all is peace and joy divine,
And heav'n and glory now are mine,
O hallelujah to the Lamb!
All is well, all is well.

What though I cannot break my chain
Or e’er throw off my load,
The things impossible to men
Are possible to God.

What time I am afraid
I put my trust in Thee;
In God I rest, and praise
His Word, so rich and free.

What time the evening shadows fall
Around the Church on earth,
When darker forms of doubt appall,
And new false lights have birth;
Then closer should her faithful band
For truth together hold,
Hell’s last devices to withstand,
And safely guard her fold.

What various hindrances we meet
In coming to a mercy seat;
Yet who that knows the worth of prayer,
But wishes to be often there.

For the Christ of Galilee,
For the truth which makes men free,
For the bond of unity
Which makes God’s children one.

What will it matter, by and by,
What will it matter, by and by
Whether my crosses were heavy or light,
Whether my pathway was cloudy or bright,
When I shall walk with the ransomed in white,
Safe in that beautiful land?

Oh, what will you do with Jesus?
The call comes loud and sweet;
As tenderly He bids you
Your burdens lay at His feet;
Oh, soul so sad and weary,
That sweet voice speaks to thee;

Jesus is standing in Pilate’s hall,
Friendless, forsaken, betrayed by all;
Hearken! what meaneth the sudden call?
What will you do with Jesus?

What wilt Thou have me to do, O Lord,
What wilt Thou have me to do?
Thou hast redeemed me, Thy right I own,
Thine are my pow’rs, my Savior, alone;
Thou hast for me such great things done.

What wisdom, majesty and grace
Through all the Gospel shine!
 ’Tis God that speaks, and we confess
The doctrine most divine.

What wonderful words in the Gospel of grace
Our loving Redeemer has giv’n!
How happy are they who in spirit are pure,
For theirs is the kingdom of Heav’n!

What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul!
What wondrous love is this, O my soul!
What wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul,
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul.

There’s a voice that whispers
To the willing heart,
And its words so tender
Joy and peace impart;
When in doubt or trouble,
To your heart be true,
Hear the Spirit saying:
What would Jesus do?

There flows from Calvary a stream
For every sinner’s pain,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never thirst again.

Whate’er my God ordains is right:
His holy will abideth;
I will be still whate’er He doth;
And follow where He guideth;
He is my God; though dark my road,
He holds me that I shall not fall:
Wherefore to Him I leave it all.

Whate’er my God ordains is right:
His holy will abideth;
I will be still whate’er He doth;
And follow where He guideth;
He is my God; though dark my road,
He holds me that I shall not fall:
Wherefore to Him I leave it all.

When Adam by transgression fell,
And conscious, fled his Maker's face,
Linked in clandestine league with hell, 
He ruined all his future race: 
The seeds of evil once brought in, 
Increased and filled the world with sin.
But lo ! the Second Adam came, 
The serpent's subtle head to bruise;
He cancels his malicious claim, 
And disappoints his devilish views; 
Ransoms poor prisoners with his blood, 
And brings the sinner back to God.
[To understand these things aright, 
This grand distinction should be known: 
Though all are sinners in God's sight, 
There are but few so in their own.
To such as these our Lord was sent; 
They're only sinners who repent.] 
[What comfort can a Saviour bring 
To those who never felt their woe ? 
A sinner is a sacred thing; 
The Holy Ghost has made him so.* 
New life from him we must receive, 
Before for sin we rightly grieve.] 
This faithful saying let us own, 
Well worthy 'tis to be believed, 
That Christ into the world came down, 
That sinners might by him be saved.
Sinners are high in His esteem, 
And sinners highly value him.


When all Thy mercies, O my God,
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, I’m lost
In wonder, love and praise.

When at this distance, Lord, we trace
The various glories of Thy face,
What transport pours o’er all our breast,
And charms our cares and woes to rest,
And charms our cares and woes to rest.

When at Thy footstool, Lord, I bend,
And plead with Thee for mercy there,
Think of the sinner’s dying Friend,
And for His sake receive my prayer.

When came in flesh the incarnate Word,
The heedless world slept on,
And only simple shepherds heard
That God had sent His Son.

When candles are lighted on Candlemas Day
the dark is behind us, and spring's on the way.

The earth was filled with peace and light,
When Christ arose;
The heavens trembled at the sight,
When Christ arose;
The sea rejoiced along the sands,
The vernal valleys clapped their hands,
The mountains sang, and all the lands,
When Christ arose.

When Christ our Lord had passed once more
Into the heaven He left before,
He sent a Comforter below
The Father’s promise to bestow.

When Christ was born in Bethlehem,
Fair peace on earth to bring,
In lowly state of love He came
To be the children’s King.

When Christ was born of Mary free
in Bethlehem that fair city.
angels sang with mirth and glee,
 "In excelsis gloria!
In excelsis gloria!
In excelsis gloria!
Angels sang with mirth and glee,
in excelsis gloria!
Herdmen beheld these angels bright-
to them appeared with great light,
who said, God's son is born this night.
When Christmas morn is dawning
In faith I would repair
Unto the lowly manger;
My Savior lieth there,
Unto the lowly manger;
My Savior lieth there.

When Christ’s appearing was made known,
King Herod trembled for his throne;
But He Who offers heavenly birth
Sought not the kingdom of this earth.

When comes the golden sunset
That trails God’s way on high,
And with its radiant splendor
Illumes the evening sky,
How are the hills and valleys
Aglow with crimson rays,
While nature’s deep toned organ
Lifts heavenward its praise:

Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptations call
Where could I go  to the Lord
Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Neighbors are fun I love em everyone
We get along in sweet accord
But when I pass the chilling hand of death
Where could I go  to the Lord
Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so well
Comfort I get from God's own Word
But when my soul needs manna from above
Where could I go  to the Lord
Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go to the Lord

When the dark waves round us roll,
And we look in vain for aid,
Speak, Lord, to the trembling soul,
 的t is I; be not afraid."

When descending from the sky
The Bridegroom shall appear;
And the solemn midnight cry,
Shall call professors near:
How the sound our hearts will damp!
How will shame o’erspread each face!
If we only have a lamp,
Without the oil of grace.

In the glory of the Father
When our Lord shall come again,
By His angel guards attended,
In His majesty to reign,

When from the East the wise men came,
Led by the Star of Bethlehem,
The gifts they brought to Jesus were
Of gold and frankincense and myrrh.

When gathering clouds around I view,
And days are dark, and friends are few,
On Him I lean, Who not in vain
Experienced every human pain;
He sees my wants, allays my fears,
And counts and treasures all my tears.

When God is nigh, my faith is strong;
His arm is my almighty prop:
Be glad, my heart; rejoice, my tongue;
My dying flesh shall rest in hope.

When God of old came down from Heav’n,
In power and wrath He came;
Before His feet the clouds were riven,
Half darkness and half flame:

When Hagar found the bottle spent,
And wept o’er Ishmael,
A message from the Lord was sent
To guide her to a well.

When Hannah, pressed with grief,
Poured forth her soul in prayer;
She quickly found relief,
And left her burden there:
Like her, in every trying case,
Let us approach the throne of grace.

When He cometh, when He cometh
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.

When He shall come resplendent in His Glory, 
To take His own from out this vale of night, 
O may I know the joy at His appearing, 
Only at morn to walk with Him in white.
When He shall call from earth's remotest corners 
All who have stood triumphant in His might, 
O to be worthy then to stand beside them 
And in that morn to walk with Him in white.
When I shall stand within the court of Heaven 
Where white robed pilgrims pass before my sight, 
Earth's martyred saints and bloodwashed overcomers 
These then are they who walk with Him in white.

I’m not on an ego trip, 
I’m nothing on my own 
I make mistakes I often slip, just common flesh and bones
But I'll prove someday, just why I say, I’m of a special kind
For when He was on the cross, I was on His mind.
For He knew me yet He loved me
He whose glory makes the heavens shine.
So unworthy of such mercy.
Yet when He was on the cross, I was on His mind.
The look of love was on His face and thorns were on His head
The blood was on His scarlet robe and stained a crimson red
Though His eyes were on the crowd that day, He looked ahead in time
For when He was on the cross, I was on His mind.
For He knew me yet He loved me
He whose glory makes the heavens shine.
So unworthy of such mercy.
Yet when He was on the cross, I was on His mind.
Yet when He was on the cross, I was on His mind.

When, His salvation bringing,
To Zion Jesus came,
The children all stood singing
Hosanna to His Name;
Nor did their zeal offend Him,
But, as He rode along,
He let them still attend Him,
And smiled to hear their song.

When I awake from slumber
To greet the golden day,
Then teach me, Lord, to number
Its hours in wisdom’s way.

When I can read my title clear to mansions in the skies,
I bid farewell to every fear, and wipe my weeping eyes.
And wipe my weeping eyes, and wipe my weeping eyes
I bid farewell to every fear, and wipe my weeping eyes.

The sands have been washed in the footprints
Of the Stranger on Galilee’s shore;
And the voice that subdued the rough billows
Will be heard in Judea no more,
But the path of that lone Galilean,
With joy I will follow today,

When I have finished my pilgrimage here,
When shall have vanquished temptation and fear,
As in the arms of His love I abide,
I shall be satisfied.

Tho’ the road may be rough where He leads me,
Still His footprints I plainly can trace,
And the trials I meet with seem nothing,
When I look in my dear Savior’s face.

When I see my Savior, hanging on Calvary,
Bearing there for sinners bitterest agony.
Gratitude o’erwhelms me, makes mine eyes grow dim,
All my ransomed being captive is to Him.

Christ our Redeemer died on the cross,
Died for the sinner, paid all his due.
All who receive Him need never fear,
Yes, He will pass, will pass over you.

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

If here on earth I serve the Lord
And hold on to His hand,
Then it will be a glorious time
When I wake up in Gloryland.
When I wake up in Gloryland,
I'll surely join the angel band.
And then I'll hold the Savior's hand,
When I wake up in Gloryland.
I like to shout and sing His praise
As for the Lord I stand.
That others here can see and know
Someday I'll wake in Gloryland.
When I wake up in Gloryland,
I'll surely join the angel band.
And then I'll hold the Savior's hand,
When I wake up in Gloryland.
For God will call me home up there
To join that heavenly band,
When my life here on earth is done
And I wake up in Gloryland.
When I wake up in Gloryland,
I'll surely join the angel band.
And then I'll hold the Savior's hand,
When I wake up in Gloryland.

The burdens of life may be many,
The frowns of the world may be cold;
To me it will matter but little,
When I walk up the streets of gold.

When in His might the Lord arose to set us free,
And Zion was restored from her captivity,
In transports then of joy and mirth
We praised the Lord of all the earth.

When in Jesus we believe, and His pardon we receive,
What a comfort to the soul the promise brings;
That the weary and oppressed, when they come to Him for rest,
He will cover with the shadow of His wings.

When in our music God is 
glorified,
and adoration leaves no room for pride,
it is as though the whole creation cried
Alleluia!
How often, making music, we have found
a new dimension in the world of sound,
as worship moved us to a more profound
Alleluia!
So has the Church, in liturgy and song,
in faith and love, through centuries of wrong,
borne witness to the truth in every tongue,
Alleluia!
And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night
when utmost evil strove against the Light?
Then let us sing, for whom he won the fight,
Alleluia!
Let every instrument be tuned for praise!
Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise!
And may God give us faith to sing always
Alleluia! Amen.

When in the night I meditate,
On mercies multiplied,
My grateful heart inspires my tongue
To bless the Lord, my Guide.

When Israel, freed from Pharaoh’s hand
Left the proud tyrant and his land,
The tribes with cheerful homage own
Their King, and Judah was His throne.

When Israel, of the Lord beloved,
Out from the land of bondage came,
Her father’s God before her moved,
An awful Guide, in smoke and flame.

When Israel out of bondage came,
A sea before them lay;
My Lord reached down His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.

When Israel out of Egypt went,
From people of a speech unknown,
The Lord among His people dwelt,
And there He set his royal throne.

When Israel was in Egypt’s land,
Let My people go,
Oppressed so hard they could not stand,
Let My people go.

When Jesus came to Jordan
to be baptized by John,
he did not come for pardon.
but as his Father's Son.
He came to share repentance
with all who mourn their sins,
to speak the vital sentence
with which good news begins.
He came to share temptation,
our utmost woe and loss,
for us and our salvation
to die upon the cross.
So when the Dove descended
on him, the Son of Man,
the hidden years had ended,
the age of grace began.
Come, Holy Spirit, aid us
to keep the vows we make,
this very day invade us,
and every bondage break.
Come, give our lives direction,
the gift we covet most:
to share the resurrection
that leads to Pentecost.

Down life’s dark vale we wander,
Till Jesus comes;
We watch and wait and wonder,
Till Jesus comes.

When Jesus comes in glory,
As Lord and King of kings,
O what a wondrous story
The blessed Bible brings;
His face will shine like sunlight,
His head be white as snow,
His eyes like flaming firelight,
His feet like brass aglow.

When Jesus comes to reward His servants,
Whether it be noon or night,
Faithful to Him will He find us watching,
With our lamps all trimmed and bright?

When Jesus led his chosen 
three,
to lift the shadow from their sight,
and on the mountain let them see
his face transfigured, crowned with light:
what grace that day to them was given!
to men on earth, a glimpse of heaven.
There Moses and Elijah stood
and spoke about his exodus,
their freedom purchased by his blood,
a Passover fulfilled for us!
The law and prophets meet their Lord,
see God revealed, and man restored.
Then from the cloud there came a voice,
 "This is my own beloved Son;"
the scriptures' theme, the Father's choice,
their master stood supreme, alone:
they saw his glory, and they heard
the one eternal, living Word.
So may we see and know this grace
the truth which like a burning light
illuminates the darkest place
till Christ himself shall end the night:
when to his people's longing eyes
God's day shall dawn, his sun shall rise.

When Jesus left His Father’s throne,
He chose a humble birth;
Like us, unhonored and unknown,
He came to dwell on earth.
Like Him may we be found below,
In wisdom’s path of peace;
Like Him in grace and knowledge grow,
As years and strength increase.

When Jesus no longer stands preciously nigh,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
I look to the Rock that is higher than I,
And peace, wondrous peace floods my soul.

There’s coming a wonderful, wonderful day,
Its glory has never been known;
When free from our burdens we’re going away,
As Jesus returns for His own.

I hear sweet whisperings of love
When Jesus speaks to me;
And blessed comfort from above,
When Jesus speaks to me.

When Jesus was born in the manger
The shepherds came thither to see,
For the angels proclaimed that a Savior was born
To save a poor sinner like me.
To save a poor sinner,
To save a poor sinner,
To save a poor sinner like me.
For the angels proclaimed that a Savior was born
To save a poor sinner like me.

When John baptized by Jordan’s river,
In faith and hope the people came,
That John and Jordan might deliver
Their troubled souls from sin and shame.
They came to seek a new beginning,
The human spirit’s ageless quest:
Repentance and an end of sinning,
Renouncing every wrong confessed.

When languor and disease invade 
This trembling house of clay, 
 'Tis sweet to look beyond the cage, 
And long to fly away.
Sweet to look inward and attend
The whispers of His love;
Sweet to look upward to the place,
Where Jesus pleads above;
Sweet to look back, and see my name
In life's fair book set down;
Sweet to look forward, and behold
Eternal joys my own;
Sweet to reflect how grace divine
My sins on Jesus laid; 
Sweet to remember that His blood 
My debt of suffering paid.
Sweet to rejoice in lively hope 
That when my change shall come, 
Angels will hover round my bed, 
and waft my spirit home.
Sweet in His righteousness to standm
Which saves from second death;
Sweet to experience day by day
His Spirit's quickening breath;
Sweet in faithfulness to rest,
Whose love can never end;
Sweet on his covenant of grace
For all things to depend;
Sweet in the confidence of faith
To trust His firm decrees;
Sweet to lie passive in His hands,
And know no will but this.
If such is the sweetness of the streams,
What must the fountains be?
Where saints and angels draw their bliss
Immediately from thee!
1Then shall my disimprisoned soul 
Behold Him and adore; 
Be with His likeness satisfied, 
And grieve and sin no more.
1If such the views which grace unfolds, 
Weak as it is below, 
What raptures must the Church above 
In Jesus' presence know!"

Jesus comes with power to gladden, when love shines in,
Every life that woe can sadden, when love shines in.
Love will teach us how to pray, love will drive the gloom away,
Turn our darkness into day, when love shines in.

When, marshaled on the nightly plain,
The glittering hosts bestud the sky,
One star alone of all the train
Can fix the sinner’s wandering eye.

When morning gilds the skies my heart awaking cries:
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Alike at work and prayer, to Jesus I repair:
May Jesus Christ be praised!

When mother love makes all things bright,
When joy comes with the morning light,
When children gather round their tree,
Thou Christmas Babe, we sing of Thee.

When mothers of Salem their children brought to Jesus,
The stern disciples drove them back and bade them to depart:
But Jesus saw them ere they fled and sweetly smiled and kindly said,
“Suffer little children to come unto Me."

When musing sorrow weeps the past,
And mourns the present pain,
 ’Tis sweet to think of peace at last,
And feel that death is gain.

When my earthly day is waning and my mortal robes I fold,
With the dawning of eternity begun,
I shall enter gates of pearl to walk on streets of shining gold,
In that city where they need no sun.

When my last hour is close at hand,
Lord Jesus Christ, attend me;
Beside me then, O Savior, stand
To comfort and defend me.
Into Thy hands I will commend
My soul at this my earthly end,
And Thou wilt keep it safely.

When my life work is ended, and I cross the swelling tide,
When the bright and glorious morning I shall see;
I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side,
And His smile will be the first to welcome me.

When my love to God grows weak,
When for deeper faith I seek,
Then in thought I go to thee,
Garden of Gethsemane.

When my way is hedged about me, hedged with thorns of care;
When the cross I loved so dearly, seems too hard to bear;
When my heart is bowed with sorrow, and no light I see—
Lord, Thy tender mercy pleading, let me lean on Thee.

When my weary hands are folded on my faintly throbbing breast,
And my soul has spread her pinions for the city of the blest;
’Twill be sweet to hear the loved ones sing some dear, familiar 
song,
As I rise to join the of the blood-washed, holy throng.

When, O Dear Jesus, When Shall I
Behold thee all serene?
Blessed in perpetual Sabbath day,
Without a veil between!
Assist me, while I wander here
Amidst a world of cares;
Incline my heart to pray with love,
And then accept my prayers.
Release my soul from ev'ry chain;
No more hell's captive led;
And pardon a repenting child,
For whom the Savoir bled.
Spare me, my God, O spare the soul
That gives itself to thee,
Take all that I possess below,
And give thyself to me.
Thy Spirit, O my Father, give,
To be my guide and friend,
To light my pain with endless joys 
A Sabbath without end.

When o’er my sins I sorrow,
Lord, I will look to Thee
And hence my comfort borrow
That Thou wast slain for me;
Yea, Lord, Thy precious blood was spilt
For me, O most unworthy,
To take away my guilt.

When on my day of life the night is falling,
And in the winds, from unsunned spaces blown,
I hear far voices out of darkness calling
My feet to paths unknown.

When on the Cross My Lord I See
Bleeding to death for wretched me,
Satan and sin no more can move,
For I am all transformed to love.
His thorns and nails pierce through my heart
In ev'ry groan I bear a part;
I view his wounds with streaming eyes,
But see! He bows his head and dies!
Come Christians, view the Lamb of God,
Wounded and dead, and bathed in blood!
Behold his side, and venture near,
The well of endless life is here.
Here I forget my cares and pains,
I drink, yet still my thirst remains;
Only the fountain-head above,
Can satisfy the thirst of love.
Oh, that I could always feel!
Lord, more and more thy love reveal!
Then my glad tongue shall loud proclaim
The grace and glory of thy name.
Thy name dispels my guilt and fear,
Revives my heart and charms my ear,
Affords a balm for ev'ry wound.
And Satan trembles at the sound.

When our heads are bowed with woe,
When our bitter tears o’erflow,
When we mourn the lost, the dear,
Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!

When our way is hedged about us,
And our cross too great to bear,
How the soul to God is lifted,
Thro’ the wondrous power of prayer.

When out on life’s ocean, the waves dashing high,
While waters are troubled, and no help is nigh,
I’ll sing Ebenezer and watch for the light,
“And call to remembrance my song in the night."

When overwhelmed with grief
My heart within me dies,
Helpless and far from all relief,
To heav'n I lift my eyes.
O lead me to the Rock
That's high above my head,
And make the cover of thy wings
My shelter and my shade.
Within thy presence Lord, Forever I'd abide;
Thou art the tow'r of my defense,
The refuge where I'd hide.
O give me, Lord, the lot
Of those who fear thy name!
If endless life be their reward,
May I possess the same.

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

When Peter boasted, soon he fell,
Yet was by grace restored;
His case should be regarded well
By all who fear the Lord.

When quiet in my house I sit,
Thy Book be my companion still,
My joy Thy sayings to repeat,
Talk o’er the records of Thy will,
And search the oracles divine,
Till every heartfelt word be mine.

When rising from the bed of death,
O’erwhelmed with guilt and fear,
I see my Maker face to face,
O how shall I appear?

When shades of night around us close,
And weary limbs in sleep repose,
The faithful soul awake may be,
And longing sigh, O Lord, to Thee.

When shall Thy lovely face be seen?
When shall our eyes behold our God?
What lengths of distance lie between,
And hills of guilt a heavy load.

When silent falls the gushing tear,
O’er cheeks grown pale with care;
And on the heart a cross is laid
That seems too hard to bear,
Remember what our Lord has said,
And trust, in weal or woe,
His holy Word, that changeth not,
Though uttered years ago.

When sinners see their lost condition
And feel the pressing load of sin,
And Jesus cometh on His mission
To heal the sin-sick heart within,
All grief must flee before His grace,
And joy divine will take its place.

When sorrows encompass me round
And many distresses I see
Astonished I cry, Can a mortal be found
Surrounded with troubles like me?
Few seasons of peace I enjoy
And they are succeeded by pain
If e'er a few moments of praise I employ
I have hours and days to complain
O! when will my sorrows subside?
O! when will my sufferings cease?
O! when to the bosom of Christ be conveyed?
To the mansions of glory and bliss?
May I be prepared for that day
When Jesus shall bid me remove
That I may in raptures go shouting away
To the arms of my heav'nly Love.
My spirit to glory conveyed
My body laid low in the ground
I wish not a tear at my grave to be shed
But all join in praising around
No sorrow be vented that day
When Jesus hath called me home
With singing and shouting let each brother say
 "He's gone from the evil to come."
If souls disembodied can know
Or visit their brethern beneath
My spirit shall join you, while singing you go
And leave all my cares in the grave
Immersed in the ocean of love
My soul, like an angel shall sing
Till Christ shall descend with a shout from above
And make all creation to ring
Our bodies, in dust shall obey
And swifter than thought shall arise
Then, changed in a moment, go shouting away
To mansions of love in the skies.

When spring unlocks the flowers to paint the laughing soil;
When summer’s balmy showers refresh the mower’s toil;
When winter binds in frosty chains the fallow and the flood;
In God the earth rejoiceth still and owns his Maker good.

When storms of life are round me beating,
When rough the path that I have trod,
Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His Name?

Will our lamps be filled and ready,
When the Bridegroom comes?
And our lights be clear and steady,
When the Bridegroom comes?
In the night, that solemn night,
Will our lamps be burning bright,
When the Bridegroom comes?

On a desert wild and lonely,
Where no hope I dared to claim,
I was troubled, sad and lonely,
When the Burden Bearer came.

When the clouds hang dark and heavy,
And the rolling surge we hear,
When no earthly pow’r can shield us
From the storm that most we fear,
O ’tis then our Father’s presence
To the trusting heart is shown,
In a bright and glorious vision
Of the rainbow round the throne.

My heart, that was heavy and sad,
Was made to rejoice and be glad,
And peace without measure I had,
When the Comforter came.

When the dark waves round us roll,
And we look in vain for aid,
Speak, Lord, to the trembling soul,
 的t is I; be not afraid."

When the day of life is brightest,
Love the fondest, hope most free,
And the steps of time beat lightest,
O my Father, lead thou me.
O my Father, lead thou me;
O my Father, lead thou me.
When the night of life is darkest,
And my soul shall tempted be;
When to sorrow's voice I listen,
O my Father, lead thou me.
Be life's pathway smooth or stony,
Let my faith still cling to thee;
Be life's future bright or stormy,
O my Father, lead thou me.

When the day of toil is done,
When the race of life is run,
Father, grant Thy wearied one
Rest forevermore.

When the great sun sinks to his rest,
His golden glories thrilling me,
And voiceless longings stir my breast,
Then teach me, Lord, to worship Thee.

When the King in His beauty shall come to His throne,
And around Him are gathered His loved ones, His own;
There be some who will knock at His fair palace door,
To be answered within, “There is mercy no more."

Oh, the weary night is waning,
And the clouds are rolling by;
See, the long expected morning
Now is dawning in the sky;
When from Zion’s lofty mountain
We shall hear the watchmen cry,
And rejoicing we shall gather
When the King shall come.

When the last trumpet’s awful voice
This rending earth shall shake;
When opening graves shall yield their charge
And dust to life awake;

When the Lord from Heav’n appears,
When are banished all our fears,
When the sleepers from the tomb,
With the watchers reach their home.

When the Lord of Love was here,
Happy hearts to Him were dear,
Though His heart was sad;
Worn and lonesome for our sake,
Yet he turned aside to make
All the weary glad.

When the mists have rolled in splendor
From the beauty of the hills,
And the sunlight falls in gladness
On the rivers and the rills,
We recall our Father’s promise
In the rainbow of the spray:
We shall know each other better
When the mists have rolled away.

When the night is o’er and the shadows past,
And eternal dawn dispels the gloom of earthly care;
In the home of God I shall rest at last,
In the land of Eden I shall dwell forever there.

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no 
more,
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

Thro’ the shining gate,
Where the angels wait,
When the saints are marching in,
The redeemed shall come,
And be crowned at home,
When the saints are marching in.

When the sheep have all been gathered,
To the Shepherd’s fold on high,
And are resting, sweetly resting
’Neath a calm, unchanging sky;
When we look with cloudless vision
Stretching far and far away,
O’er that land beyond the sunset,
Where the morning breezes play.

When the storm in its fury on Galilee fell,
And lifted its waters on high,
And the faithless disciples were bound in the spell,
Jesus whispered, "Fear not, it is I."
The storm could not bury that word in the wave;
 'T was taught through the tempest to fly;
It shall reach his disciples in every age,
Saying, "Be not afraid, it is I."
When the spirit is broken, with sorrow and care,
And comfort is ready to die,
Then the darkness shall pass, and the sunshine 
appear,
By the life-giving word, "It is I."
When death is at hand, and this cottage of clay
Is left with a tremulous sigh,
The gracious Redeemer will light all the way,
Saying, "Be not afraid, it is I."

When the sun shines bright and your heart is light,
Jesus is the Friend you need;
When the clouds hang low in this world of woe,
Jesus is the Friend you need.

When the toils of life are over,
And we lay our armor down,
And we bid farewell to earth with all its cares,
We shall meet and greet our loved ones,
And our Christ we then shall crown,
In the new Jerusalem.

When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the age proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of Man shall come in His glory
To take the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When the weary, seeking rest,
To Thy goodness flee;
When the heavy laden cast
All their load on Thee;
When the troubled, seeking peace,
On Thy Name shall call;
When the sinner, seeking life,
At Thy feet shall fall:

When the world is brightest,
and our hearts are lighest,
blessed Jesus, hear us!
Let thy hand be near us!
When life's scene is shaded,
all its bright hopes faded,
blessed Jesus, hear us!
Light of heaven, be near us!
When with blessings sated,
or by praise elated,
blessed Jesus, hear us!
Let thy cross be near us!
When our foes surround us,
while our sins have bound us,
blessed Jesus, hear us!
Let thy help be near us!
When the night of sorrow,
makes us dread tomorrow,
blessed Jesus, hear us!
Light of heaven, be near us!

There is beauty all around,
When there’s love at home;
There is joy in ev’ry sound,
When there’s love at home.
Peace and plenty here abide,
Smiling sweet on ev’ry side;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there’s love at home;
Love at home, love at home,
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there’s love at home.

There’s a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore by faith’s decree;
One by one we’ll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

When thickly beat the storms of life,
And heavy is the chastening rod,
The soul, beyond the waves of strife,
Views the eternal Rock—her God.

When this passing world is done,
When has sunk yon glaring sun,
When we stand with Christ in glory,
Looking o’er life’s finished story,
Then, Lord, shall I fully know—
Not till then—how much I owe.

When Thou, my righteous Judge shall come
To take Thy ransomed people home,
Shall I among them stand?
Shall such a worthless worm as I,
Who sometimes am afraid to die,
Be found at Thy right hand?

When through the torn sail the wild tempest is raging,
When o’er the dark wave the red lightning is gleaming,
Nor hope lends a ray the poor seaman to cherish,
We fly to our Maker, “Save, Lord, or we perish."

When through the whirl of wheels, and engines humming,
Patiently powerful for the sons of men,
Peals like a trumpet promise of His coming,
Who in the clouds is pledged to come again.

When Thy soldiers take their swords,
When they speak the solemn words,
When they kneel before Thee here,
Feeling Thee, their Father, near;
These Thy children, Lord, defend;
To their help Thy Spirit send.

When time seems short, and death is near,
And I am pressed by doubt and fear,
And sins, an overflowing tide,
Assail my peace on every side,
This thought my refuge still shall be,
I know my Savior died for me.

When to our world the Savior 
came
the sick and helpless heard his name,
and in their weakness longed to see
the healing Christ of Galilee.
That good Physician! Night and day
the people thronged about his way;
and wonder ran from soul to soul,
 "The touch of Christ has made us whole!"
His praises then were heard and sung
by opened ears and loosened tongue,
while lightened eyes could see and know
the healing Christ of long ago.
Of long ago: yet living still,
who died for us on Calvary's hill;
who triumphed over cross and grave,
his healing hands stretched forth to save.
His sovereign purpose still remains
who rose in power, and lives and reigns;
till every tongue confess his praise,
the healing Christ of all our days.

When upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

When upon the clouds of Heaven,
Christ shall come to earth again,
Will the world be glad to see Him,
When our Lord shall come again?

Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace.
In the mansions bright and blessed
He’ll prepare for us a place.

When we cross the valley there need be no shadows,
When life’s day is ended and its sorrows o’er;
When the summons comes to meet the blessed Savior,
When we rise to dwell with Him forevermore.

When we gather at last over Jordan,
And the ransomed in glory we see,
As the numberless sands of the seashore—
What a wonderful sight that will be!

Oft times the day seems long, our trials hard to 
bear,
We're tempted to complain, to murmur and despair;
But Christ will soon appear to catch His Bride 
away,
All tears forever over in God's eternal day.
It will be worth it all when we see Jesus,
Life's trials will seem so small when we see 
Christ;
One gliimpse of His dear face all sorrow will 
erase,
So bravely run the race till we see Christ.
Sometimes the sky looks dark with not a ray of 
light,
We're tossed and driven on , no human help in 
sight;
But there is one in heav'n who knows our deepest 
care,
Let Jesus solve your problem - just go to Him in 
pray'r.
It will be worth it all when we see Jesus,
Life's trials will seem so small when we see 
Christ;
One gliimpse of His dear face all sorrow will 
erase,
So bravely run the race till we see Christ.
Life's day will soon be o'er, all storms forever 
past,
We'll cross the great divide, to glory, safe at 
last;
We'll share the joys of heav'n - a harp, a home, a 
crown,
The tempter will be banished, we'll lay our burden 
down.
It will be worth it all when we see Jesus,
Life's trials will seem so small when we see 
Christ;
One gliimpse of His dear face all sorrow will 
erase,
So bravely run the race till we see Christ.

When we think of earth’s trials and cares,
And the tears that our eyelids bedew,
And are told they’re in Heaven unknown,
It seems just too good to be true.

When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

Where wilt Thou go since night draws near,
O Jesus Christ, Thou Pilgrim dear?
Lord, make me happy, be my Guest,
And in my heart, oh, deign to rest.

When wilt Thou save the people?
O God of mercy, when?
Not kings and lords, but nations,
Not thrones and crowns, but men!
Flowers of Thy heart, O God, are they;
Let them not pass, like weeds, away;
Their heritage a sunless day:
O God, save the people!

When winds are raging o’er the upper ocean,
And billows wild contend with angry roar,
 ’Tis said, far down, below the wild commotion,
That peaceful stillness reigneth evermore.

When wounded sore, the stricken heart
Lies bleeding and unbound,
One only hand, a pierced hand,
Can salve the sinner’s wound.

When Zion in her low estate
Was brought from bondage by the Lord,
In ecstasy we sang for joy,
By grace and wondrous love restored.

When, His salvation bringing,
To Zion Jesus came,
The children all stood singing
Hosanna to His Name;
Nor did their zeal offend Him,
But, as He rode along,
He let them still attend Him,
And smiled to hear their song.

Whence comes this rush of wings afar,
Following straight the Noël star?
Birds from the woods in wondrous flight,
Bethlehem seek this holy night.

Wand’ring afar from the dwellings of men,
Hear the sad cry of the lepers, the ten;
 “Jesus have mercy!" brings healing divine,
One came to worship, but where are the nine?

Where cross the crowded ways of life,
Where sound the cries of race and clan
Above the noise of selfish strife,
We hear your voice, O Son of man.

Sweet are the promises, kind is the word,
Dearer far than any message man ever heard;
Pure was the mind of Christ, sinless I see;
He the great example is, and pattern for me.

I can hear my Savior calling,
I can hear my Savior calling,
I can hear my Savior calling,
 典ake thy cross and follow, follow Me."

Where high the heavenly temple stands,
The house of God not made with hands,
A great High Priest our nature wears,
The Guardian of mankind appears.

Where is my wandering boy tonight—
The boy of my tenderest care,
The boy that was once my joy and light,
The child of my love and prayer?

Where is the holy Heav’n-born Child,
Heir of the everlasting throne,
Who Heav’n and earth hath reconciled,
And God and man rejoined in one?

Where is this stupendous 
stranger?
Prophets, shepherds, kings, advise.
Lead me to my Master's manger,
show me where my Savior lies.
O Most Mighty! O Most Holy!
Far beyond the seraph's thought:
art thou then so weak and lowly
as unheeded prophets taught?
O the magnitude of meekness!
Worth from worth immortal sprung;
O the strength of infant weakness,
if eternal is so young!
God all-bounteous, all-creative,
whom no ills from good dissuade,
is incarnate, and a native
of the very world he made.

Say, where is thy refuge, my brother,
And what is thy prospect today?
Why toil for the wealth that will perish,
The treasures that rust and decay?
Oh, think of thy soul, that forever
Must live on eternity’s shore,
When thou in the dust art forgotten,
When pleasure can charm thee no more.

Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
This world has been a Heav’n to me;
And ’mid earth’s sorrows and its woe,
 ’Tis Heav’n my Jesus here to know.

Where shall my wondering soul begin?
How shall I all to heaven aspire?
A slave redeemed from death and sin,
A brand plucked from eternal fire,
How shall I equal triumphs raise,
Or sing my great Deliverer’s praise?

On where the cross is leading,
Under the glorious banner go;
Marching in phalanx brave and strong,
We fear not to meet the foe.

Just a few more days to be filled with praise,
And to tell the old, old story;
Then, when twilight falls, and my Savior calls,
I shall go to Him in glory.

Where the Light for ever 
shineth,
where no storm ariseth more,
there the Savior meets his loved ones
on the shore.
They nor thirst, not suffer hunger,
all their tears are wiped away,
night has passed and they have entered
endless day.
Surely he, the mighty Worker,
he who slumbers not, nor sleeps,
leaveth not in useless silence
those he keeps.
They who bravely toiled amongst us
we believe are working still,
where no disappointment hinders,
no self-will.
Lo! from earth's imperfect labor
he hath called them to his feet,
there to work where, free from failure,
work is sweet.
We can spare them, loving Savior,
for we know thou guardest well
those who now with all the ransomed
sinless dwell.
Grant that we with them thy loved ones,
whom by faith we still can see,
may when life's great morning dawneth
follow thee.

If in the valley where the bright waters flow,
Jesus, my Savior leads me, gladly I’ll go;
If, by His hand directed o’er ocean’s wave,
Gladly I’ll bear His message, lost ones to save.

Our Jesus walks where the wrecks wash in,
All bruised and sore from the sea of sin;
As each comes in on the rushing tide,
He gently calls from the dark seaside.

Where will you spend eternity?
This question comes to you and me!
Tell me, what shall your answer be?
Where will you spend eternity?
Eternity! eternity!
Where will you spend eternity?

Where’er His creatures gather,
The unseen God is near;
Let rulers fear their Ruler,
Their Judge let judges fear.
How long, ye earthly judges,
Will ye pervert the right?
How long shall wicked persons
Have favor in your sight?

Wherefore do the nations rage,
And the people vainly dream,
That in triumph they can wage
War against the Lord supreme?
His Anointed they deride,
And the rulers plotting say:
Their dominion be defied,
Let us cast their bonds away.

Wherefore is it that Thou, O Lord,
Dost stand from us afar?
And wherefore hidest Thou Thyself,
When times so troublous are?

Wheresoe’er I roam thro’ valleys dreary,
Over mountains, or in pathless wood,
Ever with me is a Friend to cheer me,
Warning, comforting as none else could.
 ’Tis the Shepherd, Who once dying, bleeding,
Still through all eternity shall live;
Following His flock, protecting, feeding,
He the tend’rest care doth give;
Following His flock, protecting, feeding,
He the tend’rest care doth give.

"Take up thy cross and follow 
Me," I heard my Master say; 
 "I gave My life to ransom thee, Surrender your 
all today." 
Wherever He leads I'll go, Wherever He leads 
I'll go, 
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, Wherever 
He leads I'll go.
He drew me closer to His side, I sought His will 
to know, 
And in that will I now abide, Wherever He leads 
I'll go.
Wherever He leads I'll go, Wherever He leads 
I'll go, 
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, Wherever 
He leads I'll go.
It may be thru' the shadows dim, Or o'er the 
stormy sea, 
I take my cross and follow Him, Wherever He 
leadeth me.
Wherever He leads I'll go, Wherever He leads 
I'll go, 
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, Wherever 
He leads I'll go.
My heart, my life, my all I bring To Christ who 
loves me so; 
he is my Master, Lord, and King, Wherever He 
leads I'll go.
Wherever He leads I'll go, Wherever He leads 
I'll go, 
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, Wherever 
He leads I'll go.

Wherever you may be, whatever you may see,
That would lead you into evil, say you nay,
I will not turn aside; whatever may betide,
I’ll keep along the middle of the King’s highway.

Wherewith, O Lord, shall I draw near,
And bow myself before Thy face?
How in Thy purer eyes appear?
What shall I bring to gain Thy grace?

Whether the Word be preached or read,
No saving benefit I gain
From empty sounds or letters dead;
Unprofitable all and vain,
Unless by faith Thy Word I hear
And see its heavenly character.

While Jesus whispers to you,
Come, sinner, come!
While we are praying for you,
Come, sinner, come!
Now is the time to own Him:
Come, sinner, come!
Now is the time to know Him:
Come, sinner, come!

While life prolongs its precious light,
Mercy is found, and peace is given;
But soon, ah soon, approaching night
Shall blot out every hope of heaven.

While men grow bold in wicked ways,
And yet a God they own,
My heart within me often says,
“Their thoughts believe there’s none."

While on the verge of life I stand,
And view the scene on either hand,
My spirit struggles with my clay,
And longs to wing its flight away.

While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around,
And glory shone around.

There are lonely hearts to cherish,
While the days are going by;
There are weary souls who perish,
While the days are going by;
If a smile we can renew,
As our journey we pursue,
Oh, the good we all may do,
While the days are going by.

While the world awaited God’s redeeming love—
Came to Joseph, dreaming, Gabriel from above:
 “God would have you take this virgin as your wife,
For the Child within her is the Lord of Life!"

While Thee I seek, protecting Power,
Be my vain wishes stilled;
And may this consecrated hour
With better hopes be filled.

While their flocks the shepherds tended,
Heavenly hosts to earth descended,
Singing, with all voices blended,
 “Fear not, Christ is born today."

While we pray and while we plead,
While you see your soul’s deep need,
While our Father calls you home,
Will you not, my brother, come?

While with ceaseless course the sun
Hasted through the former year,
Many souls their race have run,
Never more to meet us here;
Fixed in an eternal fate,
They have done with all below;
We a little longer wait,
But how little—none can know.

While yet the morn is breaking,
I thank my God once more,
Beneath whose care awaking,
I find the night is o'er,
I thank Him that He calls me
To life and health anew;
I know, whate'er befalls me,
His care will still be true.

Soft as the voice of an angel,
Breathing a lesson unheard,
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers her comforting word:
Wait till the darkness is over,
Wait till the tempest is done,
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow,
After the shower is gone.

Whispering winds softly sighing, daylight dying,
Stars thro’ the low-bending heavens slowly creep;
Fluttering wings of the angels swift descending,
Beautiful chorals awaking earth from sleep.

Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
I want Thee forever to live in my soul.
Break down every idol, cast out every foe;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than 
snow.

Whithersoever Thou goest
Let me Thy footsteps attend;
Jesus, my wonderful Savior,
Loving Redeemer and Friend.

Who are these arrayed in white,
Brighter than the noon-day sun?
Foremost of the sons of light;
Nearest the eternal throne?
These are they that bore the cross,
Nobly for their Master stood;
Sufferers in His righteous cause,
Followers of the dying God.

Who are these like stars appearing,
These before God’s throne who stand?
Each a golden crown is wearing;
Who are all this glorious band?
Alleluia! Hark, they sing,
Praising loud their heav’nly King.

Who at my door is standing,
Patiently drawing near,
Entrance within demanding?
Whose is the voice I hear?

Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?   
True and tender, pure and precious, 
O how blest to call Him mine!   
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;   
He is more than life to me;   
And the fairest of ten thousand,   
In my blessed Lord I see.   
Love of Christ so freely given.   
Grace of God beyond degree,   
Mercy higher than the heaven,   
Deeper then the deepest sea.   
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;   
He is more than life to me;   
And the fairest of ten thousand,   
In my blessed Lord I see.   
What a wonderful redemption!   
Never can a mortal know   
How my sin, tho' red like crimson,   
Can be whiter than the snow.   
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;   
He is more than life to me;   
And the fairest of ten thousand,   
In my blessed Lord I see.   
Every need His hand supplying,   
Every good in Him I see;   
On His strength divine relying,   
He is all in all to me.   
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;   
He is more than life to me;   
And the fairest of ten thousand,   
In my blessed Lord I see.   
By the crystal flowing river   
With the ransomed I will sing,   
And forever and forever   
Praise and glorify the King.
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;   
He is more than life to me;   
And the fairest of ten thousand,   
In my blessed Lord I see.   

Who can measure heaven and 
earth?
God was present at their birth;
who can number seeds or sands?
every grain is in his hands:
through creation's countless days
every dawn sings out his praise.
Who can tell what wisdom brings,
first of all created things?
One alone is truly wise,
hidden from our earthbound eyes:
knowledge lies in him alone
God, the Lord upon his throne!
Wisdom in his plans he laid,
planted her in all he made;
granted her to humankind,
sowed her truth in every mind:
but with richest wisdom blessed
those who love him first and best.
Wisdom gives the surest wealth,
brings her children life and health;
teaches us to fear the Lord,
marks a universe restored:
heaven and earth she will outlast
happy those who hold her fast!

Who comes from God, as Word and 
Breath?
Holy Wisdom.
Who holds the keys of life and death?
Mighty Wisdom:
Crafter and Creator too,
eldest, she makes all things new;
she completes what God would do.
Wisest one, radiant one,
welcome, holy Wisdom!
Who lifts her voice for all to hear?
Joyful Wisdom.
Who shapes a thought and makes it clear?
Truthful Wisdom:
Teacher, drawing out our best,
magnifies what we invest,
names our truth, directs our quest.
Wisest one, radiant one,
welcome, holy Wisdom!
Whom should we seek with all our heart?
Loving Wisdom.
Who once revealed will not depart?
Faithful Wisdom:
Partner, Counselor, Comforter,
love has found none lovelier;
life is gladness lived with her.
Wisest one, radiant one,
welcome, holy Wisdom!

Who dreads, yet undismayed
Dares face his terror;
Who errs, yet having strayed
Avows his error -
Him let Saint Thomas guide,
Who stirred his fellows' pride
To move to death beside
Their Lord and Master.
Who longs for guidance clear
When doubts assail him,
Nor dares to move for fear
Lest faith should fail him -
For such let Christ's reply
To his disciple's cry,
 'I am the Way,' supply
The light in darkness.
Who grieves that love lies dead
On fate's wheel broken;
And stands uncomforted
By any token -
His faith shall be restored
By Christ's compelling word
When Thomas saw the Lord,
And seeing worshipped.

Who fathoms the eternal thought?
Who talks of scheme and plan?
The Lord is God! He needeth not
The poor device of man.
I see the wrong that round me lies,
I feel the guilt within;
I hear, with groan and travail-cries,
The world confess its sin.
Yet, in the maddening maze of things,
And tossed by storm and flood,
To one fixed stake my spirit clings;
I know that God is good!
And if my heart and flesh are weak
To bear an untired pain,
The bruised reed he will not break,
But strengthen and sustain.
I know not what the future hath
Of marvel or surprise,
Assured alone that life and death
His mercy underlies.

Who is He in yonder stall
At Whose feet the shepherds fall?
Who is He in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?

Who is on the Lord’s side? Who 
will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers, other 
lives to bring?
Who will leave the world’s side? 
Who will face the foe?
Who is on the Lord’s side? Who for 
Him will go?
By Thy call of mercy, by Thy grace 
divine,
We are on the Lord’s side—Savior, 
we are Thine!

Who is there on this Easter 
morning
runs not with John to find the grave?
Nor sees how, death's dominion scorning,
Jesus is risen, strong to save?
Who is there on this Easter morning
runs not with John to find the grave?
Who has not stood where Mary, grieving,
to that first Easter garden came,
for very joy but half believing;
whose is the voice that calls her name?
Who has not stood where Mary, grieving,
to that first Easter garden came?
Who is there doubts that night is ended?
Hear from on high the trumpets call!
Christ is in triumph now ascended,
risen and reigning, Lord of all!
Who is there doubts that night is ended?
Hear from on high the trumpets call!

Who is this fair one in 
distress,
That travels from the 
wilderness?
And pressed with sorrows and 
with sins,
On her beloved Lord she leans.

Who is this that cometh from 
Edom,
Crimson red His garments dyed?
In His hands are cruel nail 
prints,
And a spear wound in His side?
Say, who is this “Man of 
Sorrows"?
Why is He thus pierced and 
scarred?
Who with face and form so 
kingly!
Why His beauteous visage 
marred?

Who is this of Whom ye tell?
Come and see.
Where among us doth He 
dwell?
Come and see.
He is Jesus Christ the Lord;
Son of God, by saints 
adored;
Dwells with those who keep 
His Word:
Come and see.

Who is this so weak and 
helpless, Child of lowly 
Hebrew maid,
Rudely in a stable 
sheltered, coldly in a 
manger laid?
 ’Tis the Lord of all 
creation, Who this wondrous 
path hath trod;
He is God from everlasting, 
and to everlasting God.

Who is this that comes 
from Edom,
All His garments stained 
with blood;
To the slave proclaiming 
freedom;
Bringing and bestowing 
good;
Glorious in the garb He 
wears,
Glorious in the spoils He 
bears?

Who is this with 
garments gory,
Triumphing from Bozrah’s 
way;
This that weareth robes 
of glory,
Bright with more than 
victory’s ray?
Who is this unwearied 
comer
From his journey’s 
sultry length,
Traveling through 
Idume’s summer
In the greatness of his 
strength?

Who is thy neighbor? 
He whom thou
Hast power to aid or 
bless;
Whose aching heart or 
burning brow
Thy soothing hand may 
press.

Who keepeth not 
God’s Word, yet 
saith,
“I know the Lord," 
is wrong;
In him is not that 
blessed faith
Through which the 
truth is strong;
But he who hears and 
keeps the Word,
Is not of this 
world, but of God.

Who knows how near 
my end may be?
Time speeds away, 
and death comes on;
How swiftly, ah! how 
suddenly,
May death be here, 
and life be gone!
My God, for Jesus’ 
sake I pray
Thy peace may bless 
my dying day.

Who knows when death may overtake me!
Time passes on, my end draws near.
How swiftly can my breath forsake me!
How soon can life's last hour appear!
My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
Thy peace may bless my dying day.

Who shall ascend 
Thy heav’nly 
place,
Great God, and 
dwell before Thy 
face?
The man that 
minds religion 
now,
And humbly walks 
with God below.

Who shall inhabit in Thy hill,
O God of holiness?
Whom will the Lord admit to dwell
So near His throne of grace?

Who shall the 
Lord’s elect 
condemn?
 ’Tis God that 
justifies 
their souls;
And mercy, 
like a mighty 
stream,
O’er all their 
sins divinely 
rolls.

Who the 
multitudes 
can number
In the 
mansions of 
the blest,
He can weigh 
the joys 
eternal
By those 
ransomed 
ones 
possessed;
Exiled now 
on earth no 
longer,
They have 
gained the 
Home of 
Rest.

Who trusts 
in God, a 
strong 
abode
In Heaven 
and earth 
possesses;
Who looks 
in love to 
Christ 
above,
No fear 
his heart 
oppresses.
In Thee 
alone, 
dear Lord, 
we own
Sweet hope 
and 
consolation;
Our shield 
from foes, 
our balm 
for woes,
Our great 
and sure 
salvation.

Who 
will 
follow 
Jesus,
Standing 
for 
the 
right,
Holding 
up His 
banner
In the 
thickest 
fight?
List’ning 
for 
His 
orders,
Ready 
to 
obey,
Who 
will 
follow 
Jesus,
Serving 
Him 
today?

Hark! 
I 
hear 
a 
sound 
from 
o’er 
the 
water,
 ’Tis 
the 
cry 
of 
anguish 
and 
despair;
 ’Tis 
the 
cry 
of 
precious 
souls 
in 
darkness,
While 
waiting 
for 
the 
light 
of 
Jesus, 
there;
Hear 
the 
idle 
laborers 
near 
us 
saying,
 “Master 
what 
wilt 
Thou 
have 
me 
to 
do?"
The 
harvest 
now 
is 
great, 
oh! 
haste, 
my 
brother,
The 
reapers 
few.

Who 
will 
open 
mercy’s 
door?
Jesus 
will! 
Jesus 
will!
As 
for 
pardon, 
I 
implore?
Jesus, 
blessed 
Jesus 
will!

We sail along toward the harbor light,
Over the great life sea;
The breakers roar and the waves dash high,
Who will our pilot be?

Who will volunteer? See the foe is near!
Someone now must fight and the victory win!
Who will heed the call, sounding now to all?
“Fight the fight of faith" with the hosts of sin!

Who, O Lord, with 
Thee abiding,
In Thy House shall 
be Thy guest?
Who, his feet to 
Zion turning,
In Thy holy hill 
shall rest?
He that ever walks 
uprightly,
Does the right 
without a fear,
When he speaks, he 
speaks not 
lightly,
But with truth and 
love sincere.

Who, who 
are 
these 
beside 
the 
chilly 
wave,
Just on 
the 
borders 
of the 
silent 
grave,
Shouting 
Jesu’s 
power to 
save,
 “Washed 
in the 
blood of 
the 
Lamb"?

The whole wide world for Jesus!
This shall our watchword be;
Upon the highest mountain,
Down by the widest sea;
The whole wide world for Jesus!
To Him shall all men bow,
In city or in prairie,
The world for Jesus now!

Whole-hearted thanksgiving to Thee I will bring
In praise of Thy marvelous deeds I will sing;
In Thee I will joy and exultingly cry,
Thy Name I will praise, O Jehovah, Most High.

I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;
Teach me how, teach me how;
I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;
Help me, help me now.

Whom have I in Heav’n above? Only Thee, my Savior;
Whom have I on earth to love? Only Thee, my Savior;
Who my wounded heart can heal, Who my every sorrow feel,
Who the light of joy reveal? Only Thee, my Savior.

Whom oceans part, O Lord, unite
To love Thy Name and seek Thy light;
Though from each other far we be,
Let none, O Christ, be far from Thee.

“Whosoever heareth," shout, shout the sound!
Spread the blessed tidings all the world around;
Spread the joyful news wherever man is found;
“Whosoever will may come."

Why did the Gentiles tumults raise?
What rage was in their brain?
Why do the people still contrive
A thing that is but vain?

Why did the Jews proclaim their rage?
The Romans, why their swords employ?
Against the Lord their powers engage,
His dear Anointed to destroy?

Why did the nations join to slay
The Lord’s anointed Son?
Why did they cast His laws away,
And tread His Gospel down?

Why do the holy angels sing?
Why do the heav’nly arches ring
With anthems sweet from seraphs bright,
With glitt’ring crowns and robes of white?

Why do we mourn departing friends,
Or shake at death’s alarms?
’Tis but the voice that Jesus sends
To call them to His arms.

Why do you wait, dear brother,
Oh, why do you tarry so long?
Your Savior is waiting to give you
A place in His sanctified throng.


Why doth the Lord stand off so far?
And why conceal His face,
When great calamities appear,
And times of deep distress?

Why doth the man of riches grow
To insolence and pride,
To see his wealth and honors flow
With every rising tide?

Why dost Thou stand afar,
O Lord, in our distress?
And why dost Thou conceal Thyself
When troublous times oppress?

Why has my God my soul forsook,
Nor will a smile afford?
Thus David once in anguish spoke,
And thus our dying Lord.

Why, Herod, unrelenting foe,
Doth the Lord’s coming move thee so?
He doth no earthly kingdom seek
Who brings His kingdom to the meek.

Why, impious Herod, shouldst thou fear
Because the Christ is come so near?
He Who doth heavenly kingdoms grant
Thine earthly realm can never want.

While we pray and while we plead,
While you see your soul’s deep need,
While our Father calls you home,
Will you not, my brother, come?

O why not say Yes to the Savior tonight?
He’s tenderly pleading with thee
To come to Him now with thy sin burdened heart
For pardon so full and so free.

Why should cross and trial grieve me?
Christ is near with His cheer,
Never will He leave me.
Who can rob me of the Heaven
That God’s Son for my own
To my faith hath given?

Love sent my Savior to die in my stead;
Why should He love me so?
Meekly to Calvary's cross He was led;
Why should He love me so? 
Nails pierced His hands and His feet for my sin;
Why should He love me so?
He suffered sore my salvation to win;
Why should He love me so?
O how He agonized there in my place;
Why should He love me so?
Nothing withholding my sin to efface;
Why should He love me so? 
Why should He love me so?
Why should He love me so?
Why should my Savior to Calvary go?
Why should He love me so?

Why should I charge my soul with care?
The wealth of every mine
Belongs to Christ, God’s Son and Heir,
And He’s a Friend of mine.

Why should I fear in evil days,
With snares encompassed all around?
What trust can transient treasures raise
For them in riches who abound?
His brother who from death can save?
What wealth can ransom him from God?
What mine of gold defraud the grave?
What hoards but vanish at His nod?

Why should I fear the darkest 
hour,
or tremble at the tempter's power?
Jesus vouchsafes to be my tower.
Though hot the fight, why quit the field?
Why must I either flee or yield?
Since Jesus is my mighty shield?
I know not what may soon betide
or how my wants shall be supplied;
but Jesus knows and will provide.
Though sin would fill me with distress,
the throne of grace I dare address,
for Jesus is my righteousness.
Though faint my prayers and cold my love,
my steadfast hope shall not remove
while Jesus intercedes above.
Against me earth and hell combine;
but on my side is power divine;
Jesus is all and he is mine.

Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

Why should I vex my soul, and fret
To see the wicked rise?
Or envy sinners waxing great
By violence and lies?

Why should our tears in sorrow flow
When God recalls His own;
And bids them leave a world of woe
For an immortal crown?

Why should the children of a King
Go mourning all their days?
Great Comforter! descend and bring
Some tokens of Thy grace.

Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim’rous worms we mortals are!
Death is the gate of endless joy,
And yet we dread to enter there.

Why standest Thou afar, O Lord,
Why art Thou hid in trouble’s hour?
The wicked persecute the poor
In haughty pride and reckless power.

Wide open are Thy hands,
Paying with more than gold
The awful debt of guilty men,
Forever and of old.
Ah, let me grasp those hands,
That we may never part,
And let the power of their blood
Sustain my fainting heart.

When I have finished my journey on earth,
Ended my labor of love,
When I am waiting for Jesus to say,
 “Haste to thy mansion above."

There are loved ones in the glory,
Whose dear forms you often miss;
When you close your earthly story,
Will you join them in their bliss?

I am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
When through wonderful grace by my Savior I stand,
Will there be any stars in my crown?

Hear the footsteps of Jesus,
He is now passing by,
Bearing balm for the wounded,
Healing all who apply;
As He spake to the suff’rer
Who lay at the pool,
He is saying this moment,
“Wilt thou be made whole?"

Jesus waits to welcome you,
Will you come? Will you come?
Arms of love outstretched to you,
Will you come? Will you come?

Will you come, will you come, with your poor broken heart,
Burdened and sin oppressed?
Lay it down at the feet of your Savior and Lord,
Jesus will give you rest.

We’re traveling home to Heav’n above,
Will you go? Will you go?
We sing the Savior’s dying love,
Will you go? Will you go?
Millions have reached that blest abode,
Anointed kings and priests to God,
And millions now are on the road,
Will you go? Will you go?

Will you go and speak to the lost ones here
To the ones who have gone astray?
Will you lead them back to the Shepherd’s fold
From their wand’rings in sin’s dark way?

Will you go to Jesus now, dear friend?
He is calling you today:
Will you seek the bright and better land,
By “the true and living Way"?

Will you meet me in the Homeland,
Shall we both reach Heav’n at last,
When the training days are ended,
And life’s journeys all are past?

1-3:

Wilt thou forgive that sin, 
where I begun,
which is my sin, though it were done before?
Wilt thou forgive those sins through which I run,
and do run still, though still I do deplore?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
for I have more.
Wilt thou forgive that sin, by which I won
others to sin, and made my sin their door?
Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did not shun
a year or two, but wallowed in a score?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
for I have more.
I have a sin of fear that when I've spun
my last thread, I shall perish on the shore;
swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son
shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore.
And having done that, thou hast done,
I fear no more.

Wilt Thou hear the voice of praise
Which the little children raise,
Thou Who art, from endless days,
Glorious God of all?
While the circling year has sped,
Thou hast heavenly blessings shed,
Like the dew, upon each head;
Still on Thee we call.

If you would work for the Master today,
Win the one next to you;
If you would show some poor wand’rer the way
Oh, win the one next to you.

Hear our watchword loudly ringing,
Win the world for Christ;
Precious souls to Jesus bringing,
Win the world for Christ;
We must all take hold together;
Ev’ry one must do his share;
Seek them one by one, till the work is done;
Labor on (labor on) with pray’r.

If to Christ our only King
Men redeemed we strive to bring,
Just one way this may be done—
We must win them one by one.

On the wings of a snow white 
dove, He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above, On the wings of dove.
When troubles surround us, When evils come
The body grows weak, The spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love, On the wings of a dove.
On the wings of a snow white dove, He sends His 
pure sweet love
A sign from above, On the wings of dove.
When Jesus went down To the river that day
He was baptized In the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed His Son
He sent Him His love, On the wings of dove
On the wings of a snow white dove, He sends His 
pure sweet love
A sign from above, On the wings of dove.
When Noah had drifted, On the flood many days
He searched for land, In various ways
Troubles he had some, But wasn't forgotten
He sent him His love, On the wings of a dove.
On the wings of a snow white dove, He sends His 
pure sweet love
A sign from above, On the wings of dove.

Winter in his heart of gloom
Sings the song of coming bloom:
So over death our souls shall sing
 ’Lays of the eternal spring.

Winter reigns o’er many a region,
Many a seed field fallow lies;
When, O Lord, shall come the springtime,
With its quickening energies?
When shall this long night be ended?
When the morning dawn appear?
When shall drought give place to freshness?
When these deserts bloom with cheer?

Wise men seeking Jesus,
Traveled from afar,
Guided on their journey
By a beauteous star.

With broken heart and contrite sigh,
A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry;
Thy pard’ning grace is rich and free:
O God, merciful to me.

With Christ we share a mystic grave,
With Christ we buried lie;
But ’tis not in the darksome cave
By mournful Calvary.

With firm resolve I held my peace
And spake not either bad or good,
Lest I should utter sinful thoughts
While wicked men before me stood.

With gladness we worship, rejoice as we sing,
Free hearts and free voices, how blessed to bring!
The old thankful story shall seek Thine abode,
Thou King of all glory, most bountiful God!

With gladsome feet we press to Sion’s holy mount,
Where gushes from its deep recess the cooling fount;
Oh! happy, happy hill, the joy of every saint!
With sweet Siloam’s crystal rill, that cheers the faint.

With glorious clouds encompassed round,
Whom angels dimly see,
Will the Unsearchable be found,
Or God appear to me?

With glory clad, with strength arrayed,
The Lord, that o’er all nature reigns,
The world’s foundations strongly laid,
And the vast fabric still sustains.

With grateful heart my thanks I bring,
Before the great Thy praise I sing;
I worship in Thy holy place
And praise Thee for Thy truth and grace;
For truth and grace together shine
In Thy most holy Word divine,
In Thy most holy Word divine.

With happy voices ringing, Thy children, Lord, 
appear;
Their joyous praises bringing in anthems sweet and 
clear.
For skies of golden splendor, for azure rolling 
sea,
For blossoms sweet and tender, O Lord, we worship 
Thee.

With hearts renewed, and cleansed from guilt of 
sin,
Send we our voices pealing to the skies;
Let a pure conscience echo joy within,
And all our powers in emulation rise:
To Father, Son and Holy Spirit’s praise,
Three Whom One Essence joins, one anthem here we 
raise.

With joy and gladness in my soul
I hear the call to prayer;
Let us go up to God’s own house
And bow before Him there,
And bow before Him there.

With joy I heard my friends exclaim,
 “Come, let us in God’s temple meet;
Within thy gates, O Zion blest,
Shall ever stand our willing feet."

With joy we hail the sacred day,
Which God has called His own;
With joy the summons we obey
To worship at His throne.

With joy we meditate the grace
Of our High Priest above;
His heart is made of tenderness,
His bowels melt with love.

With my whole heart I’ll raise my song,
Thy wonders I’ll proclaim;
Thou, sovereign Judge of right and wrong,
Wilt put my foes to shame.

With one consent, let all the earth
To God their cheerful voices raise;
Glad homage pay with awful mirth,
And sing before Him songs of praise.

With restless and ungoverned rage
Why do the heathen storm?
Why in such rash attempts engage,
As they can ne’er perform?

With reverence 
let the saints appear,
And bow before the Lord;
His high commands with reverence hear,
And tremble at His Word.

With solemn faith we offer up
And spread, O God, before Thine eyes
That only ground of all our hope,
That precious, once-made Sacrifice,
Which brings Thy grace on sinners down,
And perfects all our souls in one.

With tearful eyes I look around;
Life seems a dark and stormy sea;
Yet, midst the gloom, I hear a sound,
A heavenly whisper, “Come to Me."

With Tears of Anguish I Lament
Here at thy feet, my God
My passion, pride, and discontent
And vile ingratitude.
Sure there was ne'er a heart so base,
So false as mine has been
So faithless to its promises,
So prone to ev'ry sin.
My reason tells me thy commands
Are holy, just and true;
Tells me whate'er my God demands
Is His most righteous due.
Reason I hear, her counsels weigh.
And all her words approve;
But still I find it hard t'obey,
And harder yet to love.
How long, dear Savior, shall I feel
These strugglings in my breast?
When wilt thou bow my stubborn will,
And give my conscience rest?
Break, sov'reign Grace, O break the charm,
And set the captive free;
Reveal, Almighty God, thine arm,
And haste to rescue me.

With the body that was broken,
to the body who proclaim,
by the blood that is life's token,
for the life found in his name:
so the Word-made-flesh has spoken,
and his presence here we claim.
In the cross of Christ confiding,
by the cross we bear as sign,
through the Spirit's gifts and guiding,
with these gifts of bread and wine:
so the church in faith abiding
keeps the feast Christ made divine.
Fed by breaking and outpouring,
joined in breaking-forth of praise,
given the peace of God's restoring,
sent in peace to live always:
so we show forth our adoring
as God's servants all our days.

With the sweet word of peace
We bid our brethren go;
Peace as a river to increase,
And ceaseless flow.

With Thine own pity, Savior, see
The thronged and darkening way!
We go to win the lost to Thee;
O help us, Lord, we pray!

With weary feet and saddened heart,
From toil and care we flee,
And come, O dearest Lord, apart,
To rest awhile with Thee.

Within my heart, O Lord, fulfill
The purpose of Thy death and pain,
That all may know Thou livest still
In blood-washed hearts to rule and reign.

Within the Church’s sacred fold,
By holy sacrament enrolled,
Another lamb we lay:
An heir before of sin and shame,
Now in the holy triune Name
His guilt is washed away.

Within the churchyard, side by side,
Are many long low graves;
And some have stones set over them,
On some the green grass waves.

Within the Father’s house
The Son hath found His home;
And to His temple suddenly
The Lord of Life hath come.

Within the maddening maze of things,
When tossed by storm and flood,
To one fixed trust my spirit clings;
I know that God is good!

Within Thy temple, Lord,
We on Thy mercies dwell;
Far as Thy Name is known,
There doth Thy praise excel:
Thy praises sound through every land,
And right Thy scepter shall command.

Woe to the men on earth who dwell,
Nor dread the Almighty’s frown,
When God doth all His wrath reveal,
And shower His judgments down!

Word of the Father, O light from on high,
Wonderful book, wonderful book,
Guide to our glorious home in the sky,
Wonderful book of life.

Jesus came into my heart one day,
Taking my burdens and sins away,
Bringing a peace that ever stays;
Wonderful, boundless peace.

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Greater than all my sin;
How shall my tongue describe it,
Where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden,
Setting my spirit free;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.

In love He redeemed me, the Savior divine,
I’m trusting in Him, life eternal is mine;
Unworthy the least of His gifts to receive—
Salvation is mine as on Him I believe.

Wonderful love that rescued me, sunk deep in sin,
Guilty and vile as I could be—no hope within;
When every ray of light had fled, O glorious day!
Raising my soul from out the dead, love found a way.

Tell it to others as onward you go,
Wonderful message of love;
Send it from hearts that with joy overflow,
Wonderful message of love.

Wonderful night! Wonderful night!
Angels and shining immortals,
Thronging thine ebony portals,
Fling out their banners of light,
Wonderful, wonderful night!

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial strains it unceasingly falls
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.

Coming to Jesus, my Savior, I found
Wonderful peace, wonderful peace;
Storms in their fury may rage all around,
I have peace, sweet peace.

Jesus, my King, my wonderful Savior,
All of my life is given to Thee.
I am rejoicing in Thy salvation;
Thy precious blood now maketh me free.

Wonderful story of love;
Tell it to me again;
Wonderful story of love;
Wake the immortal strain!
Angels with rapture announce it,
Shepherds with wonder receive it;
Sinner, O won’t you believe it?

Wonderful story of love;
Tell it to me again;
Wonderful story of love;
Wake the immortal strain!
Angels with rapture announce it,
Shepherds with wonder receive it;
Sinner, O won’t you believe it?

There never was a truer Friend than Jesus,
He hears me when my heart for mercy pleads;
And no one knows my burdens like my Jesus,
For He alone can understand my needs.

There is never a day so dreary,
There is never a night so long,
But the soul that is trusting in Jesus
Will somewhere find a song.

Angels from heaven in the silent night,
Sang to the shepherds with their voices bright,
 "Wake up shepherds, time is fleeting!
Tell your lambs to stop their bleating!
Find the Wondrous Child!"
Trusting and eager, they searched for the Child;
Found him in a manger, Babe and Mother mild;
Happily they bowed before him,
Piping praise they all adored him,
Jesus Wondrous Child.
Come all you people, come to find our King;
come to the stable, hearts as offering;
Can't you hear the shepherds singing,
Can't you hear the joybells ringing
for our Wondrous Child?
Angels from heaven in the silent night,
Sang to the shepherds with their voices bright,
Angels singing, bells a-ringing,
All their joyful sounds are bringing
To our Wondrous Child.

Wondrous it seemeth to me
Jesus so gracious should be,
Mercy revealing, comforting, healing,
Blessing a sinner like me.

Over the mountains so bleak and so cold,
Far from the beautiful city of gold;
Lost ones are straying because you and I
Never have told them a Savior is nigh.

Soul astray in darkness, bowed by 
sin and woe,
One still dearly loves you, tho' you downward go;
Tenderly He calls you in the gath'ring gloom,
Hear Him sweetly pleading "Won't you come back 
home?"

Word supreme, before creation
Born of God eternally,
Who didst will for our salvation
To be born on earth, and die;
Well Thy saints have kept their station,
Watching till Thine hour is nigh.

Work, for the day is coming!
Day in the Word foretold,
when, 'mid the scenes triumphant,
longed for by saints of old,
he who on earth a stranger
traversed its paths of pain,
Jesus, the Prince, the Savior,
comes evermore to reign.
Work, for the day is coming!
Darkness will soon be gone,
then o'er the night of weeping
day without end shall dawn.
What now we sow in sadness,
then we shall reap in joy;
hope will be changed to gladness,
praise be our best employ.
Work, for the Lord is coming!
Children of light are we;
from Jesus' bright appearing
power of darkness flee.
Soon will our strife be ending,
soon all our toils below,
not to the dark we're tending,
but to the day we go.

Work, for the night is coming,
Work through the morning hours;
Work while the dew is sparkling,
Work ’mid springing flowers;
Work when the day grows brighter,
Work in the glowing sun;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man’s work is done.

Out where the reapers are toiling
Out where they earnestly call,
Let us away in the morning,
There is a work for us all;
Lifting the vines that are drooping,
Trying their bloom to renew,
Bathing their leaves in a fountain
Purer and sweeter than dew.

Work is sweet, for God has blest
Honest work with quiet rest,
Rest below and rest above
In the mansions of His love,
When the work of life is done,
When the battle’s fought and won.

Work is sweet, for God has 
blest
honest work with quiet rest;
rest below and rest above,
in the mansions of his love,
when the work of life is done,
when the battle's fought and won.
Work ye, then, while yet 'tis day,
work, ye Christians, while ye may;
work for all that's great and good,
working for your daily food,
working whilst the golden hours,
health and strength and youth are yours.
Working not alone for gold,
not for work that's bought and sold;
not the work that worketh strife,
but the working of a life;
careless both of good or ill,
if ye can but do his will.
Working ere the day is gone,
working till your work is done;
not as traffickers at marts,
but as fitteth honest hearts;
working till your spirits rest
with the spirits of the blest.

Working in the vineyard,
Working all the day,
Never be discouraged,
Only watch and pray;
Do your duty nobly,
Heart and hand unite,

Workman of God! O lose not heart,
But learn what God is like;
And in the darkest battlefield
Thou shalt know where to strike.

Worship, and thanks, and blessing,
And strength ascribe to Jesus!
Jesus alone
Defends his own,
When earth and hell oppress us.
Jesus with joy we witness
Almighty to deliver;
Our seals set to,
That God is true,
And reigns a King for ever.
Omnipotent Redeemer,
Our ransomed souls adore thee:
Our Saviour thou,
We find it now,
And give thee all the glory.
We sing thine arm unshortened,
Brought through our sore temptation;
With heart and voice
In thee rejoice,
The God of our salvation.
Thine arm hath safely brought us
A way no more expected,
Than when thy sheep
Passed through the deep,
By crystal walls protected.
Thy glory was our rearward,
Thine hand our lives did cover,
And we, ev'n we,
Have walked the sea,
And marched triumphant over.
The world, and Satan's malice
Thou, Jesus, hast confounded;
And, by thy grace,
With songs of praise
Our happy souls resounded.
Accepting our deliverance,
We triumph in thy favour,
And for the love
Which now we prove
Shall praise thy name for ever.

Rise O Church and lift your voices 
Christ has conquered death and hell 
Sing as all the earth rejoices 
Resurrection anthems swell 
Come and worship come and worship 
Worship Christ the Risen King

Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;
Gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,
Bring and adore Him—the Lord is His Name.

“Worthy is the Lamb," the hosts of Heaven sing,
As before the throne they make His praises ring;
 “Worthy is the Lamb the book to open wide,
Worthy is the Lamb Who once was crucified."

“Worthy is the Lamb," the hosts of Heaven sing,
As before the throne they make His praises ring;
 “Worthy is the Lamb the book to open wide,
Worthy is the Lamb Who once was crucified."

Would Jesus have the sinner die?
Why hangs He then on yonder tree?
What means that strange expiring cry?
 (Sinners, He prays for you and me)
 “Forgive them, Father, O forgive,
They know not that by Me they live,"
 “They know not that by Me they live!"

Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

Would you be this day made whole,
Freedom gain from sin’s control?
Jesus can redeem your soul—
Jesus, Jesus only.

Would you live for Jesus, and be always pure and 
good?
Would you walk with Him within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your burden, carry all your 
load?
Let Him have His way with thee.

Would you be this day made whole,
Freedom gain from sin’s control?
Jesus can redeem your soul—
Jesus, Jesus only.

Wounded for me, wounded for me,
There on the cross He was wounded for me;
Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,
All because Jesus was wounded for me.

Sing we the praises of Jesus, the wonderful Savior 
of men;
Sing how He died for our ransom, yet liveth in glory 
again;
Tell how His grace is sufficient a world of lost 
sinners to save;
Tell how whoever believeth a perfect salvation shall 
have.

A year of precious blessings
And glorious victories won,
Of earnest work progressing,
Its onward course has run;
To Thee, O God, our Refuge,
Whose goodness crowns our days,
Within Thy earthly temple,
We lift our souls in praise;
Within Thy earthly temple,
We lift our souls in praise.
Thou Master of assemblies
In mighty power descend,
Behold our glad reunion,
Conduct it to the end;
Inspire our hearts with courage
And deeper love for Thee,
That all, Thy Name may honor,
Where’er our field may be,
That all, Thy Name may honor,
Where’er our field may be.
O Church of God’s anointed,
March on the world to win,
Lead forth thy ranks by millions
Against the hosts of sin,
Till at His throne in glory,
Where angels prostrate fall,
One hallelujah 
Shall crown Him Lord of all,
One hallelujah 
Shall crown Him Lord of all.

The year is gone, beyond recall,
With all its hopes and fears,
With all its bright and gladdening smiles,
With all its mourners’ tears.
Thy thankful people praise Thee, Lord,
For countless gifts received;
And pray for grace to keep the faith
Which saints of old believed.
To Thee we come, O gracious Lord,
The newborn year to bless;
Defend our land from pestilence,
Give peace and plenteousness.
Forgive this nation’s many sins,
The growth of vice restrain;
And help us all with sin to strive,
And crowns of life to gain.
From evil deeds that stain the past
We now desire to flee;
And pray that future years may all
Be spent, good Lord, for Thee.
O Father, let Thy watchful eye
Still look on us in love,
That we may praise Thee, year by year,
With angel hosts above.
All glory to the Father be,
All glory to the Son,
All glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,
While endless ages run.

The year is swiftly waning,
The summer days are past;
And life, brief life, is speeding;
The end is nearing fast.
The ever changing seasons
In silence come and go;
But Thou, eternal Father,
No time or change canst know.
O, pour Thy grace upon us,
That we may worthier be,
Each year that passes o’er us,
To dwell in heaven with Thee.
Behold the bending orchards
With bounteous fruit are crowned;
Lord, in our hearts more richly
Let heavenly fruits abound.
O, by each mercy sent us,
And by each grief and pain,
By blessings like the sunshine,
And sorrows like the rain.
Our barren hearts make fruitful
With every goodly grace,
That we Thy Name may hallow,
And see at last Thy face.

Yahweh, Yahweh
Ancient One yet you're here today
Ageless One, Changeless One
Showing love to all generations
Show us your glory, oh Lord
Let your goodness pass before us
Right before our eyes
And we will wor - ship, and we will bow down
And we will call you Lord
And we will kneel before the mak - er of the un - iverse
And we will call you Lord
Yahweh, Yahweh
Faithful One, you have shown us the way
Through the years, through all our lives
You have shown you are faithful to the end
Yah - weh, Yah - weh, etc.

Ye angels who stand round the throne,
And view my Immanuel’s face,
In rapturous songs make Him known;
O tune your soft harps to His praise.
He formed you the spirits you are,
So happy, so noble, so good;
While others sank down in despair,
Confirmed by His power, you stood.
Ye saints who stand nearer than they,
And cast your bright crowns at His feet,
His grace and His glory display,
And all His rich mercy repeat:
He snatched you from hell and the grave,
He ransomed from death and despair;
For you He was mighty to save,
Almighty to bring you safe there.
O when will the period appear
When I shall unite in your song?
I’m weary of lingering here,
And I to your Savior belong;
I’m fettered and chained up in clay,
I struggle and pant to be free;
I long to be soaring away,
My God and my Savior to see.
I want to put on my attire,
Washed white in the blood of the Lamb;
I want to be one with your choir,
And tune my sweet harp to His Name.
I want—O I want to be there,
Where sorrow and sin bid adieu,
Your joy and your friendship to share,
To wonder and worship with you.

Ye are the light of the world,
Driving the darkness away,
Shedding your beams on the lost,
Changing their night into day.
Then let your light ever shine,
Showing the right way to go;
Gladly the lost ones will see—
God’s boundless love they will know.

Ye are the light of the world, Driving the darkness away, Shedding your beams on 
the lost, Changing their night into day.Then let your light ever shine, Showing 
the right way to go; Gladly the lost ones will see— God’s boundless love they 
will know.
Ye are the light of the world, Causing the clouds to depart, Throwing the 
sunshine of peace Down on the poor burdened heart.Then let your light ever 
shine; Loved ones are panting for rest; Sunshine their souls will revive, 
Lifting them up to the blest.
Ye are the light of the world; Thro’ you the true light must shine, Calling the 
lost sons of men Home to the Father divine.Then let your light ever shine, 
Hallow the Name that is love; You will each shine as a star, Fixed in the orbit 
above.

Ye children, come, give ear to me
And learn Jehovah’s fear,
He who would long and happy live,
Let him my counsel hear.
Restrain thy lips from speaking guile,
From wicked speech depart,
From evil turn and do the good,
Seek peace with all thy heart.
Jehovah’s eyes are on the just,
He hearkens to their cry;
Against the wicked sets His face;
Their very name shall die.
He hears the righteous when they cry,
From trouble sets them free;
He saves the broken hearted ones
And those who contrite be.
The Lord may suffer many griefs
Upon the just to fall,
But He will bring them safely through;
Delivering them from all.
By evil are the evil slain,
And they that hate the just;
But all His servants God redeems,
And safe in Him they trust.

Ye choirs of new Jerusalem,
To sweet new strains attune your theme;
The while we keep, from care released,
With sober joy our Paschal feast:
When Christ, unconquer’d Lion, first
The dragon’s chains by rising burst:
And while with living voice He cries,
The dead of other ages rise.
Engorged in former years, their prey
Must death and hell restore today:
And many a captive soul, set free,
With Jesus leaves captivity.
Right gloriously He triumphs now,
Worthy to Whom should all things bow;
And joining heaven and earth again,
Links in one commonweal the twain.
And we, as these His deeds we sing,
His suppliant soldiers, pray our King,
That in His palace, bright and vast,
We may keep watch and ward at last.
Long as unending ages run,
To God the Father, laud be done:
To God the son, our equal praise,
And God the Holy Ghost, we raise.

Ye Christian heralds, go proclaim
Salvation through Emmanuel’s Name;
To distant climes the tidings bear,
And plant the Rose of Sharon there.
Ruler of worlds, display Thy power,
Be this Thy Zion’s favored hour;
Bid the bright morning star arise,
And point the nations to the skies.
Set up Thy throne where Satan reigns,
On Afric shores, on India’s plains;
On wilds and continents unknown,
And be the universe Thine own!
Speak and the world shall hear Thy voice;
Speak and the deserts shall rejoice!
Scatter the shades of mortal night;
Let worthless idols flee the light!
Trusting in Him, dear brethren, rear
The Gospel standard void of fear;
Go seek with joy your destined shore,
To view your native land no more.
He’ll shield you with a wall of fire,
With flaming zeal your hearts inspire,
Bid raging winds their fury cease,
And hush the tempests into peace.
And when our labors are all o’er,
Then we shall meet to part no more;
Meet with the blood bought throng to fall,
And crown our Jesus, Lord of all!

Ye fainting souls, lift up your eyes
To where the morning lights the skies!
The awful shadows flee away
Before the swift advancing day.
The Lord is ris’n; He could not die;
He lives for you eternally;
And by His victory o’er the grave
His people He will surely save!
No longer mourn your seeming loss;
No longer weep before the cross,
Nor search the darkness of the tomb;
While overheard the morn has come!
Now what shall harm your joyful souls
While your Redeemer all controls?
No night shall hide again His face;
No grave shall be His resting place.

Ye faithful souls, who Jesus know,
If risen indeed with him ye are,
Superior to the joys below,
His resurrection's power declare.
Your faith by holy tempers prove,
By actions show your sins forgiven,
And seek the glorious things above,
And follow Christ, your Head, to heaven.
There your exalted Saviour see,
Seated at God's right hand again,
In all his Father's majesty,
In everlasting power to reign.
To him continually aspire,
Contending for your native place;
And emulate the angel choir,
And only live to love and praise.
For who by faith your Lord receive,
Ye nothing seek or want beside;
Dead to the world and sin ye live,
Your creature-love is crucified.
Your real life, with Christ concealed,
Deep in the Father's bosom lies;
And, glorious as your Head revealed,
Ye soon shall meet him in the skies.

Ye gates, lift your heads, the glad summons obey,
Ye doors everlasting, wide open the way.
The King of all glory high honors await,
The King of all glory shall enter in state.
What King of all glory is this that ye sing?
The Lord, strong and mighty, the conquering King.
Ye gates, lift your heads, and His summons obey,
Ye doors everlasting, wide open the way.
The King of all glory high honors await,
The King of all glory shall enter in state.
What King of all glory is this that ye sing?
Jehovah of Hosts, He of glory is King.

Ye holy angels bright,
Who stand before God’s throne
And dwell in glorious light,
Praise ye the Lord each one.
Assist our song, or else the theme
Too high doth seem for mortal tongue.
Ye blessed souls at rest,
That see your Savior’s face,
Whose glory, e’en the least,
Is far above our grace.
God’s praises sound, as in His sight
With sweet delight you do abound.
Ye saints, who toil below,
Adore your heavenly King,
And onward as ye go
Some joyful anthem sing;
Take what He gives and praise Him still,
Through good or ill, Who ever lives!
All nations of the earth,
Extol the world’s great King:
With melody and mirth
His glorious praises sing,
For He still reigns, and will bring low
The proudest foe that Him disdains.
Sing forth Jehovah’s praise,
Ye saints, that on Him call!
Him magnify always
His holy churches all!
In Him rejoice and there proclaim
His holy Name with sounding voice.
My soul, bear thou thy part,
Triumph in God above,
And with a well tuned heart
Sing thou the songs of love.
And all my days let no distress
Nor fears suppress His joyful praise.
Away, distrustful care!
I have Thy promise, Lord:
To banish all despair,
I have Thine oath and Word:
And therefore I shall see Thy face
And there Thy grace shall magnify.
With Thy triumphant flock
Then I shall numbered be;
Built on th’eternal Rock,
His glory shall we see.
The heav’ns so high
With praise shall ring
And all shall sing in harmony.

Ye humble souls, approach your God
With songs of sacred praise,
For He is good, immensely good,
And kind are all His ways.
All nature owns His guardian care,
In Him we live and move;
But nobler benefits declare
The wonders of His love.
He gave His Son, His only Son,
To ransom rebel worms;
’Tis here He makes His goodness known
In its diviner forms.
To this dear refuge, Lord, we come;
’Tis here our hope relies;
A safe defense, a peaceful home,
When storms of trouble rise.
Thine eye beholds, with kind regard,
The souls who trust in Thee;
Their humble hope Thou wilt reward,
With bliss divinely free.

Ye humble souls, that seek the Lord,
Chase all your fears away;
And bow with rapture down to see
The place where Jesus lay.
Thus low the Lord of life was brought;
Such wonders love can do:
Thus cold in death that bosom lay,
Which throbbed and bled for you.
But raise your eyes, and tune your songs,
The Savior lives again:
Not all the bolts and bars of death
The Conqueror could detain.
High o’er the angelic bands He rears
His once dishonored head;
And through unnumbered years He reigns,
Who dwelt among the dead.
With joy like His shall every saint
His vacant tomb survey;
Then rise with His ascending Lord
To realms of endless day.

Ye that know the Lord is gracious,
ye for whom a cornerstone
stands, of God elect and precious,
laid that ye may build thereon,
see that on that sure foundation
ye a living temple raise,
towers that may tell forth salvation,
walls that may re-echo praise.
Living stones, by God appointed
each to his allotted place,
kings and priests, by God anointed,
shall ye not declare his grace?
Ye, a royal generation,
tell the tidings of your birth,
tidings of a new creation
to an old and weary earth.
Tell the praise of him who called you
out of darkness into light,
broke the fetters that enthralled you,
gave you freedom, peace and sight:
tell the tale of sins forgiven,
strength renewed and hope restored,
till the earth, in tune with heaven,
praise and magnify the Lord.

Ye lands, to the Lord make a jubilant noise;
Glory be to God!
Oh, serve Him with joy, in His presence now rejoice;
Sing praise unto God out of Zion!
Not we, but the Lord is our Maker, our God;
Glory be to God!
His people we are, and the sheep led by His rod;
Sing praise unto God out of Zion!
Oh, enter His gates with thanksgiving and praise;
Glory be to God!
To bless Him and thank Him our voices we will raise;
Sing praise unto God out of Zion!
For good is the Lord, and His mercy is sure;
Glory be to God!
To all generations His truth shall endure;
Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

Ye little flock whom Jesus feeds,
Dismiss your anxious cares;
Look to the Shepherd of your souls,
And smile away your fears.
Though wolves and lions prowl around,
His staff is your defense;
’Midst sands and rocks, your Shepherd’s voice,
Calls streams and pastures thence.
Your Father will a kingdom give,
And give it with delight;
His feeblest child His love shall call,
To triumph in His sight.
Ten thousand praises, Lord, we bring,
For sure supports like these;
And o’er the pious dead we sing,
Thy living promises.

Ye messengers of Christ,
His sov’reign voice obey;
Arise and follow where He leads,
And peace attend your way.
The Master Whom ye serve,
Will needful strength bestow;
Depending on His promised aid,
With sacred courage go.
Mountains shall sink to plains,
And hell in vain oppose;
The cause is God’s and must prevail,
In spite of all His foes.
Go, spread a Savior’s Name,
And tell His matchless grace,
To the most guilty and depraved
Of Adam’s num’rous race.

A ruler once came to Jesus by night
To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
The Master made answer in words true and plain,
“Ye must be born again."
“Ye must be born again,
Ye must be born again,
I verily, verily, say unto thee,
Ye must be born again."
Ye children of men, attend to the Word,
So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord;
And let not this message to you be in vain,
“Ye must be born again."
O ye who would enter that glorious rest,
And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest,
The life everlasting if ye would obtain,
“Ye must be born again."
A dear one in Heaven thy heart yearns to see,
At the beautiful gate may be watching for thee,
Then list to the note of this solemn ,
“Ye must be born again."

Ye must be willing to be saved.
If ye would feel the power
Of Jesus and his mighty love.
The Christian's strength and tower.
Ye can not be saved against your will:
Oh.hear the holy word!
"Whoever will." and only he,
Can love and serve the Lord.
Be willing then.that he should come
And save your soul from sin;
Throw open wide its inmost doors.
And let the Savior in.
Ye can not be saved against your will:
Oh.hear the holy word!
"Whoever will." and only he,
Can love and serve the Lord.
Be willing.oh.be willing now.
And enter his employ;
His service is delight on earth.
In heaven eternal joy.
Ye can not be saved against your will:
Oh.hear the holy word!
"Whoever will." and only he,
Can love and serve the Lord.

Ye nations round the earth, rejoice
Before the Lord, your sovereign King,
Serve Him with cheerful heart and voice;
With all your tongues His glory sing.
The Lord is God; ’tis He alone
Doth life and breath and being give;
We are His work, and not our own;
The sheep that on His pastures live.
Enter His gates with songs of joy,
With praises to His courts repair;
And make it your divine employ
To pay your thanks and honors there.
The Lord is good, the Lord is kind;
Great is His grace, His mercy sure;
And the whole race of man shall find
His truth from age to age endure.

Ye neighbors, and friends of Jesus, draw near:
His love condescends by titles so dear
To call and invite you His triumph to prove,
And freely delight you in Jesus’ love.
The Shepherd Who died His sheep to redeem,
On every side are gathered to Him
The weary and burdened, the reprobate race;
And wait to be pardoned through Jesus’ grace.
The blind are restored through Jesus’ Name,
They see their dear Lord, and follow the Lamb;
The halt they are walking, and running their race;
The dumb they are talking of Jesus’ grace.
The deaf hear His voice and comforting Word,
It bids them rejoice in Jesus their Lord,
“Thy sins are forgiven, accepted thou art";
They listen, and heaven springs up in their heart.
The lepers from all their spots are made clean,
The dead by His call are raised from their sin;
In Jesus’ compassion the sick find a cure,
And Gospel salvation is preached to the poor.
To us and to them is published the Word:
Then let us proclaim our life giving Lord,
Who now is reviving His work in our days,
And mightily striving to save us by grace.
O Jesus! ride on till all are subdued,
Thy mercy make known, and sprinkle Thy blood;
Display Thy salvation, and teach the new song
To every nation, and people, and tongue.

Ye pilgrims that are wand'ring home,
Ye foll'wers of the Lamb,
Sweeter to me than honey-comb.
Is Christ's exalted name.
Let us with undissembled love,
Like children in one band,
March to our Father's house above,
And to the promised land.
My little flock, I bid adieu,
Our parting is to-day;
O may we all to Christ prove true,
And try to watch and pray.
There is one thing that wounds my heart,
And grieves my soul full sore;
To think we must in body part,
Perhaps to meet no more.
We need not wait but few more days
Then he will call us home,
Where fear of parting ne'er will come,
In that bright world above.
Where we'll surround the throne of God,
And sing redeeming love;
And there I hope to see your face,
And join to praise the Lord.

Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;
’Tis comely that with joyful voice
God’s saints His Name should praise.
With harp and hymn of gladness sing,
Your gift of sweetest music bring,
To Him a new song raise.
For upright is Jehovah’s Word,
And all the doings of the Lord
In justice have their birth.
In judgment and in deeds of right
The Lord forever takes delight,
His goodness fills the earth.
Jehovah speaks, the heav’ns appear;
He breathes, and lo, each shining sphere
In splendor stands arrayed.
He rolls the water heap on heap,
He stores away the mighty deep
In garners for it made.
Let all the earth Jehovah fear,
Let all that dwell both far and near
In awe before Him stand;
For lo, He spoke and it was done,
And all, with sovereign power begun,
Stood fast at His command.
He makes the nations’ counsels vain,
The plans the peoples would maintain
Are thwarted by His hand.
Jehovah’s counsels stand secure,
His purposes of heart endure,
Forevermore they stand.
O truly is the nation blest
Whose God, before the world confessed,
Jehovah is alone;
And blest the people is whom He
Has made His heritage to be,
And chosen for His own.

Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
And publish abroad His wonderful Name;
The Name all victorious of Jesus extol,
His kingdom is glorious and rules over all.
The waves of the sea have lift up their voice,
Sore troubled that we in Jesus rejoice;
The floods they are roaring, but Jesus is here;
While we are adoring, He always is near.
When devils engage, the billows arise,
And horribly rage, and threaten the skies:
Their fury shall never our steadfastness shock,
The weakest believer is built on a rock.
God ruleth on high, almighty to save,
And still He is nigh, His presence we have;
The great congregation His triumph shall sing,
Ascribing salvation to Jesus, our King.
“Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!"
Let all cry aloud and honor the Son;
The praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
Fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.
Then let us adore and give Him His right,
All glory and power, all wisdom and might;
All honor and blessing with angels above,
And thanks never ceasing and infinite love.

Ye servants of our glorious King,
To Him your thankful praises bring;
And tell the deeds that grace has done,
The triumphs by His martyrs won.
Since they were faithful to the last,
Their holy struggles now are past;
The bitterness of death is o’er,
And theirs is bliss forevermore.
The flame might scorch, the knife lay bare,
And cruel beasts their members tear;
No powers of earth, no powers of hell
The souls that loved their Lord could quell.
Forever broken is the chain
That sought to bind them, but in vain;
O let us strive like them to win
Our freedom from the bonds of sin.
O Savior, may our portion be
With those who gave themselves to Thee,
Through all eternity to sing
All praise to Thee, the martyrs’ King.

Ye servants of the Lord,
Each in his office wait,
Observant of His heavenly Word,
And watchful at His gate.
Let all your lamps be bright,
And trim the golden flame,
Gird up your loins, as in His sight,
For awful is His Name.
Watch: ’tis your Lord’s command,
And while we speak He’s near;
Mark the first signal of His hand,
And ready all appear.
O happy servant he,
In such a posture found!
He shall His Lord with rapture see,
And be with honor crowned.
Christ shall the banquet spread
With His own royal hand,
And raise that faithful servant’s head
Amid the angelic band.

“Ye shall be My witnesses," was Jesus’ last command,
To every kindred tongue and tribe, in every clime and land;
Go, tell them of our Christ and say His kingdom is at hand,
Who will go and witness for Jesus?
Tell it out, tell it out, the blessed Gospel sound,
Tell it out, tell it out, the news the world around,
Till the Name of Jesus has been heard wherever man is found,
Who will go and witness for Jesus?
Jesus has commissioned you and me to go or send,
A messenger in His dear Name, His glorious cross defend;
And He has promised to be with us, even to the end,
God has said be of good courage, neither be afraid,
Though mountains seem to hedge the way, He says be undismayed;
For Jesus is our Captain and will always be our aid,
Hear the suff’ring millions crying for the living Bread,
When Christ was here His words were, “Let the multitudes be fed."
Then haste wherever man is found, for all His blood was shed,

Ye simple men of heart sincere,
Shepherds who watch your flocks by night,
Start not to see an angel near,
Nor tremble at this glorious light.
“A herald from the heavenly King,
I come, your every fear to chase;
Good tidings of great joy I bring,
Great joy to all the fallen race.
“To you is born on this glad day,
A Savior by our host adored;
Our God in Bethlehem survey,
Make haste to worship Christ the Lord.
“By this the Savior of mankind,
Th’incarnate God shall be displayed;
The Babe ye wrapped in swaths shall find,
And humbly in a manger laid."

[Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!]
Ye sons and daughters of the King,
whom heavenly hosts in glory sing,
today the grave bath lost its sting.Alleluia!
On that first morning of the week,
before the day began to break,
the Marys went their Lord to seek.Alleluia!
An Angel bade their sorrow flee,
for thus he spake unto the three:
'Your Lord is gone to Galilee.' Alleluia! 
That night the Apostles met in fear,
amidst them came their Lord most dear,
and said: 'Peace be unto you here!' Alleluia!
When Thomas afterwards had heard
that Jesus had fulfilled hiœ word,
he doubted if it were the Lord.Alleluia!
'Thomas, behold my side,' saith he, 
'my hands, my feet, my body see;
'and doubt not, but believe in me.' Alleluia!
No longer Thomas then denied;
he saw the feet, the hands, the side;
'Thou art my Lord and God,' he cried.Alleluia!
Blessed are they that have not seen,
and yet whose faith bath constant been,
in life eternal they shall reign.Alleluia!
On this most holy day of days,
to God your hearts and voices raise
in laud, and jubilee, and praise.Alleluia!
And we with holy Church unite,
as evermore is just and right,
in glory to the King of Light.Alleluia!

Ye sons of earth prepare the plough,
Break up your fallow ground!
The Sower is gone forth to sow,
And scatter blessings round.
The seed that finds a stony soil
Shoots forth a hasty blade;
But ill repays the sower’s toil,
Soon withered, scorched, and dead.
The thorny ground is sure to balk
All hopes of harvest there;
We find a tall and sickly stalk,
But not the fruitful ear.
The beaten path and highway side
Receive the trust in vain;
The watchful birds the spoil divide,
And pick up all the grain.
But where the Lord of grace and power
Has blessed the happy field,
How plenteous is the golden store
The deep wrought furrows yield!
Father of mercies, we have need
Of Thy preparing grace;
Let the same hand that gives me seed
Provide a fruitful place!

Ye sons of men, a feeble race,
Exposed to every snare,
Come, make the Lord your dwelling place,
And try and trust His care.
No ill shall enter where you dwell;
Or if the plague come nigh,
And sweep the wicked down to hell,
’Twill raise His saints on high.
He’ll give His angels charge to keep
Your feet in all their ways;
To watch your pillow while you sleep,
And guard your happy days.
Their hands shall bear you, lest you fall
And dash against the stones:
Are they not servants at His call,
And sent t’attend His sons?
Adders and lions ye shall tread;
The tempter’s wiles defeat;
He that hath broke the serpent’s head
Puts him beneath your feet.
“Because on Me they set their love,
I’ll save them," saith the Lord;
“I’ll bear their joyful souls above
Destruction and the sword.
“My grace shall answer when they call,
In trouble I’ll be nigh;
My power shall help them when they fall,
And raise them when they die.
“They that on earth My Name have known
I’ll honor them in Heav’n;
There My salvation shall be shown,
And endless live be giv’n."

Ye sons of men, oh, hearken:
Your heart and mind prepare;
To hail th’almighty Savior,
Oh sinners, be your care.
He Who of grace alone
Our Life and Light was given,
The promised Lord from Heaven,
Unto our world is shown.
Prepare the way before Him;
Prepare for Him the best.
Cast out whate’er offendeth
This great, this heav’nly Guest.
Make straight, make plain, the way:
The lowly valleys raising,
The heights of pride abasing,
His path all even lay.
The humble heart and lowly
God lifteth up on high;
Beneath His feet in anguish
The haughty soul shall lie.
The heart, sincere and right,
That heeds God’s invitation
And makes true preparation,
It is the Lord’s delight.
Prepare my heart, Lord Jesus,
Turn not from me aside,
And grant that I receive Thee
This blessed Adventide.
From stall and manger low
Come Thou to dwell within me;
Loud praises will I sing Thee
And forth Thy glory show.

Ye sons of men, with joy record
The various wonders of the Lord;
And let His power and goodness sound
Through all your tribes the earth around.
Let the high heavens your songs invite;
Those spacious fields of brilliant light,
Where sun and moon and planets roll,
And stars that glow from pole to pole.
See earth in verdant robes arrayed,
Its herbs and flowers, its fruit and shade;
View the broad sea’s majestic plains,
And think how wide its Maker reigns.
But O that brighter world above,
Where lives and reigns Incarnate Love!
God’s only Son in flesh arrayed,
For man a bleeding Victim made.
Thither, my soul, with rapture soar:
There in the land of praise adore:
This theme demands an angel’s lay,
Demands an undeclining day.

Ye that obey th’immortal King,
Attend His holy place;
Bow to the glories of His power,
And bless His wondrous grace.
Lift up your hands by morning light,
And send your souls on high;
Raise your admiring thoughts by night
Above the starry sky.
The God of Zion cheers our hearts
With rays of quick’ning grace;
The God that spread the heav’ns abroad,
And rules the swelling seas.

Ye that pass by, behold the Man,
The Man of grief condemned for you;
The Lamb of God for sinners slain
Weeping to Calvary pursue.
His sacred limbs, they stretch, they tear,
With nails they fasten to the wood—
His sacred limbs exposed and bare,
Or only covered with His blood.
See there! His temples crowned with thorns,
His bleeding hands extended wide;
His streaming feet transfixed and torn,
The fountain gushing from His side.
Thou dear, Thou suff’ring Son of God,
How doth Thy heart to sinners move!
Sprinkle on us Thy precious blood,
And melt us with Thy dying love.

Ye thirsty for God, to Jesus give ear,
And take, through His blood, a power to draw near;
His kind invitation ye sinners embrace,
Accepting salvation, salvation by grace.
Sent down from above, Who governs the skies,
In vehement love to sinners He cries,
“Drink into My Spirit, who happy would be,
And all things inherit by coming to Me."
O Savior of all, Thy Word we believe!
And come at Thy call, Thy grace to receive;
The blessing is given wherever Thou art.
The earnest of Heaven is love in the heart.
To us at Thy feet the Comforter give,
Who gasp to admit Thy Spirit, and live;
The weakest believers acknowledge for Thine,
And fill us with rivers of water divine.

Ye virgin souls, arise,
With all the dead awake
Unto salvation wise,
Oil in your vessels take;
Upstarting at the midnight cry,
“Behold the heavenly Bridegroom nigh!"
He comes, He comes, to call
The nations to His bar,
And raise to glory all
Who fit for glory are;
Made ready for your full reward,
Go forth with joy to meet your Lord.
Go, meet Him in the sky,
Your everlasting Friend;
Your Head to glorify,
With all His saints ascend;
Ye pure in heart, obtain the grace
To see, without a veil, His face!
Ye that have here received
The unction from above,
And in His Spirit lived,
Obedient to His love,
Jesus shall claim you for His bride:
Rejoice with all the sanctified!
The everlasting doors
Shall soon the saints receive,
Above yon angel powers
In glorious joy to live;
Far from a world of grief and sin,
With God eternally shut in.
Then let us wait to hear
The trumpet’s welcome sound;
To see our Lord appear,
Watching let us be found;
When Jesus doth the heavens bow,
Be found—as, Lord, Thou find’st us now!

Ye watchers and ye holy ones,
Bright seraphs, cherubim and thrones,
Raise the glad strain, Alleluia!
Cry out, dominions, princedoms, powers,
Virtues, archangels, angels’ choirs:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia!
O higher than the cherubim,
More glorious than the seraphim,
Lead their praises, Alleluia!
Thou bearer of th’eternal Word,
Most gracious, magnify the Lord.
Respond, ye souls in endless rest,
Ye patriarchs and prophets blest,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Ye holy twelve, ye martyrs strong,
All saints triumphant, raise the song.
O friends, in gladness let us sing,
Supernal anthems echoing,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One.

Ye who His temple throng, Jehovah’s praise prolong,
New anthems sing;
Ye saints with joy declare, your Maker’s loving care
And let the children there joy in their King.
O let His Name employ your every note of joy,
His praises speak;
He looks with loving face upon His chosen race,
And will with every grace adorn the meek.
Ye saints your joy proclaim and glory in the Name
Of God above;
And when the daylight dies, ere sleep shall close your eyes,
Let praise to God arise for all His love.

Ye who own the faith of Jesus,
sing the wonders that were done
when the love of God the Father
over sin the victory won,
when he made the Virgin Mary
mother of his only Son.
Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, full of grace.
Blessed were the chosen people
out of whom the Lord did come;
blessed was the land of promise
fashioned for his earthly home;
but more blessed far the mother,
she who bare him in her womb.
Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, full of grace.
Wherefore let all faithful people
tell the honor of her name;
let the Church, in her foreshadowed,
part in her thanksgiving claim;
what Christ's mother sang in gladness
let Christ's people sing the same.
Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, full of grace.
Let us weave our supplications,
she with us and we with her,
for the advancement of the faithful,
for each faithful worshiper,
for the doubting, for the sinful,
for each heedless wanderer.
Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, full of grace.
May the Mother's intercessions
on our homes a blessing win,
that the children all be prospered,
strong and fair and pure within,
following our Lord's own footsteps,
firm in faith and free from sin.
Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, full of grace.
For the sick and the aged,
for our dear ones far away,
for the hearts that mourn in secret,
all who need our prayers today,
for the faithful gone before us,
may the holy Virgin pray.
Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, full of grace.
Praise, O Mary, praise the Father,
praise thy Savior and thy Son,
praise the everlasting Spirit,
who hath made thee ark and throne
o'er all creatures high exalted,
lowly praise the Three in One.
Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, full of grace.

Ye who the Name of Jesus bear,
His sacred steps pursue;
And let that mind which was in Him
Be also found in you.
Though in the form of God He was,
His only Son declared,
Nor to be equally adored
As robbery did regard;
His greatness He for us abased,
For us His glory veiled;
In human likeness dwelt on earth,
His majesty concealed:
Nor only as a man appears,
But stoops a servant low;
Submits to death, nay, bears the cross,
In all its shame and woe.
Hence God this generous love to men
With honors just hath crowned,
And raised the Name of Jesus far
Above all names renowned:
That at this Name, with sacred awe,
Each humble knee should bow
Of hosts immortal in the skies,
And nations spread below:
That all the prostrate powers of hell
Might tremble at His Word,
And every tribe, and every tongue,
Confess that He is Lord.

Yea, as I live, Jehovah saith,
I would not have the sinner’s death,
But that he turn from error’s ways,
Repent, and live through endless days.
To us therefore Christ gave command:
“Go forth and preach in every land;
Bestow on all My pardoning grace
Who will repent and mend their ways.
“All those whose sins ye thus remit
I truly pardon and acquit;
And those whose sins ye do retain
Condemned and guilty shall remain.
“What ye shall bind, that bound shall be;
What ye shall loose, that shall be free;
Unto My church the keys are giv’n
To ope and close the gates of Heav’n."
The words which absolution give
Are His Who died that we might live;
The minister whom Christ has sent
Is but His humble instrument.
When ministers lay on their hands,
Absolved by Christ the sinner stands;
He who by grace the Word believes
The purchase of His blood receives.
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee
For absolution full and free,
In which Thou showest forth Thy grace;
From false indulgence guard our race.
Praise God the Father and the Son
And Holy Spirit, Three in One,
As ’twas, is now, and so shall be
World without end, eternity!

Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.
By God’s Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.
Now I’ve given to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!
Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!

Yes, for me, for me He careth
With a brother’s tender care;
Yes with me, with me He shareth
Every burden, every fear.
Yes, o’er me, o’er me He watcheth,
Ceaseless watcheth, night and day;
Yes, e’en me, e’en me He snatcheth
From the perils of the way.
Yes for me He standeth pleading
At the mercy seat above;
Ever for me interceding,
Constant in untiring love.
Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth;
I in Him, and He in me!
And my empty soul He filleth,
Here and through eternity.

Yes, God is good; in earth and sky,
From ocean depths and spreading wood,
Ten thousand voices seem to cry,
“God made us all, and God is good."
The sun that keeps his trackless way
And downward pours his golden flood,
Night’s sparkling hosts, all seem to say,
In accents clear, that God is good.
The merry birds prolong the strain,
Their song with every spring renewed;
And balmy air, and falling rain,
Each softly whispers, “God is good."
I hear it in the rushing breeze;
The hills that have for ages stood,
The echoing sky and roaring seas,
All swell the , God is good.
Yes, God is good, all nature says,
By God’s own hand with speech endued;
And man, in louder notes of praise,
Should sing for joy that God is good.
For all Thy gifts we bless Thee, Lord,
But chiefly for our heavenly food;
Thy pardoning grace, Thy quickening word,
These prompt our song, that God is good.

He took my feet from the miry clay
Yes, He did, yes He did
And placed them on the Rock to stay

Yes, He did, yes He did
O Jesus washed my sins away
Yes, He did, yes He did
And made me happy all the day

O my Lord did just what He said
Yes, He did, yes He did
He healed the sick and raised the dead
Yes, He did, yes He did

Come, ye sinners, lost and hopeless,
Jesus’ blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you,
When He saved a wretch like me.
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus’ blood can make the vilest sinner clean,
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus’ blood can make the vilest sinner clean.
To the faint He giveth power,
Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,
Turns the night to golden day.
In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the pow’rs of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety,
Gives you grace for ev’ry day.
He will keep thee while the ages
Roll throughout eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee.

Yes, Lord, yes Lord I believe
Yes, Lord, I believe You're alive in me
I'm gonna shout aloud to the Rock
The Rock of My Salvation
Yes, Lord, yes Lord I believe
I believe the tomb is empty
'Cause I know my heart is full
Of the glory and the wonder of Your name
I believe the power that raised You
Is alive in me right now
And the joy within my heart
Can't be contained

Yes, Lord, yes, to Your will and to Your way 
Yes, Lord, yes, I will trust You and obey 
When Your Spirit speaks to me, with my whole heart I'll agree 
And my answer will be yes, Lord, yes! 
Verse: 
Lord I give You all the glory for all You've given me 
You have filled my life until I overflows 
All I have is Yours to use, just anyway You choose 
You are Lord of all, so how can I say no.So I say.
Verse: 
If I never knew the fullness of living in Your will 
You see, I would never know how rich my life could be 
Lord, my willingness to serve, is the least that You deserve 
For all the blessings you have showered over me.And I say.

Yes, the Redeemer rose, the Savior left the dead,
And o’er our hellish foes high raised His conquering head.
In wild dismay the guards around,
Fall to the ground and sink away.
Lo! the angelic bands in full assembly meet,
To wait His high commands and worship at His feet.
Joyful they come, and wing their way
From realms of day to see His tomb.
Then back to Heav’n they fly and the glad tidings bear.
Hark! as they soar on high, what music fills the air!
Their anthems say, “Jesus, Who bled,
Hath left the dead, He rose today."
Ye mortals, catch the sound, redeemed by Him from hell;
And send the echo round the globe on which you dwell:
Transported, cry, “Jesus, Who bled,
Hath left the dead, no more to die."
All hail! triumphant Lord, Who sav’st us with Thy blood;
Wide be Thy Name adored, Thou rising, reigning God!
With Thee we rise, with Thee we reign,
And empires gain beyond the skies.

Oh come to the Savior, believe in His Name,
And ask Him your heart to renew;
He waits to be gracious, O turn not away,
For now there is pardon for you.
Yes, there is pardon for you,
Yes, there is pardon for you;
For Jesus has died to redeem you,
And offers full pardon to you.
The way of transgression that leads unto death,
Oh, why will you longer pursue?
How can you reject the sweet message of love
That offers full pardon for you?
Be warned of your danger; escape to the cross;
Your only salvation is there;
Believe, and that moment the Spirit of grace
Will answer your penitent prayer.

Oh, why should I be lost,
So careless meet my doom?
I hear a loving voice
Inviting me to come.
Yes, whosoever will
May freely come to God;
’Tis mercy calling still,
Come, sinner, to the blood.
The Spirit and the bride,
And angels ’round the throne,
Assure me Jesus died
That I may freely come.
I know that God is love,
He freely gave His Son,
Who intercedes above,
That I may truly come.
I hear the strong appeal
From my Redeemer’s throne,
And in my heart I feel
That even I may come.
Yes, whosoever will,
Thy word, O Lord, I own;
Though near the brink of hell,
All heaven bids me come.

O how sweet the glorious message simple faith may claim
Yesterday, today, forever Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful, heal the sick and lame
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest, glory to His Name.
Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same.
All may change, but Jesus never! Glory to His Name!
Glory to His Name! Glory to His Name!
All may change, but Jesus never! Glory to His Name!
He, who was the Friend of sinners, seeks the lost one now
Sinner come, and at His footstool penitently bow
He Who said “I’ll not condemn thee, go and sin no more,"
Speaks to thee that word of pardon as in days of yore.
Oft on earth He healed the sufferer by His mighty hand
Still our sicknesses and sorrows go at His command
He who gave His healing virtue to a woman’s touch
To the faith that claims His fullness still will give as much.
As of old He walked to Emmaus, with them to abide
So through all life’s way He walketh ever near our side
Soon again we shall behold Him, Hasten Lord the day
But twill still be this same Jesus as He went away.

Yesterday, with exultation,
Joined the world in celebration,
Of her promised Savior’s birth;
Yesterday the angel nation
Poured the strains of jubilation
O’er the Monarch born on earth.
But today o’er death victorious,
By his faith and actions glorious,
By his miracles renowned,
See the Deacon triumph gaining,
’Midst the faithless faith sustaining,
First of holy martyrs found.
Onward, champion, falter never,
Sure of sure reward forever,
Holy Stephen, persevere;
Perjured witnesses confounding,
Satan’s synagogues astounding
By thy doctrine true and clear.
Thine own Witness is in Heaven,
True and faithful, to thee given,
Witness of thy blamelessness;
By thy name a crown implying,
Meet it is thou shouldst be dying
For the crown of righteousness.
For the crown that fadeth never
Bear the torturer’s brief endeavor;
Victory waits to end the strife;
Death shall be thy life’s beginning,
And life’s losing be the winning
Of the true and better life.
Filled with God’s most Holy Spirit,
See the Heav’n thou shalt inherit,
Stephen, gaze into the skies;
There God’s glory steadfast viewing,
Thence thy victor strength renewing,
Pant for thy eternal prize.
See, as Jewish foes invade thee,
See how Jesus stands to aid thee,
Stands at God’s right hand on high:
Tell how opened heaven is shown thee,
Tell how Jesus waits to own thee,
Tell it with thy latest cry.
As the dying martyr kneeleth,
For his murderers he appealeth,
For their madness grieving sore;
Then in Christ he sleepeth sweetly,
And with Christ he reigneth meetly,
Martyr firstfruits, evermore.

“Yet there is room": the Lamb’s bright hall of song,
With its fair glory, beckons thee along;
Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.
Day is declining, and the sun is low;
The shadows lengthen, light makes haste to go;
Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.
The bridal hall is filling for the feast;
Pass in, pass in, and be the Bridegroom’s guest;
Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.
It fills, it fills, that hall of jubilee!
Make haste, make haste; ’tis not too full for thee;
Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.
O enter in; that banquet is for thee;
That cup of everlasting joy is free;
Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.
All heaven is there, all joy! Go in, go in;
The angels beckon thee the prize to win:
Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.
Louder and sweeter sounds the loving call;
Come, lingerer, come; enter that festal hall;
Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.
Ere night that gate may close, and seal thy doom;
Then the last low, long cry, “No room, no room!"
No room, no room! O woeful cry, “No room!"

Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin;
Each victory will help you some other to win;
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue,
Look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.
Ask the Savior to help you,
Comfort, strengthen and keep you;
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.
Shun evil companions, bad language disdain,
God’s Name hold in reverence, nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest, kindhearted and true,
Look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.
To him that o’ercometh, God giveth a crown;
Through faith we shall conquer, though often cast down;
He Who is our Savior our strength will renew;
Look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.

When I make mistakes I need a shoulder to cry on
And a forgiving hand to hold
You never forsake, You’re always there rely on
And carry me back to the fold
Oh, when my will gets weak
And my doubts get strong
And everything that’s right goes wrong (goes wrong)
In You there’s hope
(In You) In You there’s peace
(In You) I find in You everything I need
(If I) If I owned this world (owned this world) and I had to choose (I had to 
choose)
I’d trade it all to keep the friend I’ve found in You (in You)
Sometimes I feel like everyone is against me
It’d be easier to just give in (just give in)
That’s when I kneel and in prayer You convince me
That with You it’s a fight I can win
When I feel like a vessel
So lost at sea
And there’s no solid ground within reach, yeah
I run, but I stumble
And I try and I fail
But because of a cross and three nails
There is hope

You are the only one I need
I bow all of me at Your feet
I worship You alone
You have given me more than
I could have ever have wanted
And I want to give you my heart and my soul
You alone are Father and You alone are good
You alone are Savior and You alone are God

And here You are, shining in a glory that I can see.
When I look beyond myself and I fall into the depths
Of your love that beckons me.
Well it fills my hungerin' soul with all the riches
That are hidden in the wonders that You do.
And in the words that You have spoken
There's a word that echoes still.
And I can hear it in the silence of these hills.
Lord, you are all that the world could not be.
You are great and strong.You are good.
Lord, You are all, and everything that I could ever need.
You are faith, You are hope, You are love.
Yes, You are love, You are peace, You're my most high,
So now I fall down on my knees and cry, You are all.
And here we are, in a light that showers from things unseen.
Drawn from earth, dropped from the sky
They have crept into our lives and called us to believe.
In the One of whom the distant clouds bear witness.
He was wounded, He was raised and glorified.
And His voice thunders in the heavens,
And it pulses through our veins,
And we can find salvation in the One, the Name.

Holy, You are still holy
Even when the darkness surrounds my life
Sov'erign, You are still sov'erign

Lord I don't deserve Your kind affection
When my unbelief has kept me from Your touch
I want my life to be a pure reflection of Your love
So I come into Your chambers and I dance at Your feet, Lord
You are my savior and I'm at Your mercy
All that has been in my life until now
Belongs to You, for You are still holy

You are the Christ, the Son of the living God
Some say John the Baptist, Elijah, or Jeremiah
But you are the Christ, the Son of the living God
This was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven
When Jesus came to Caeserea of Philippi
He asked, "who do people say the Son of man is?"
Some say John the Baptist and others Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the 
prophets
"But what about you?" He asked, "Who do you say I am?"
Peter said.
Blessed are you Simon, son of Jonah
For this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven
I tell you that you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church
Hades will not overcome it
And we know.
I give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
Whatever you bind will be bound up in heaven
I give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
Whatever you loose will be loosed up in heaven
'Cause.
Yes by my Father in heaven

Your voice was heard at my new birth 
We'll praise your name to all creation
We'll praise your name our God most high

We'll praise your name until we die

You are there
You are there

Where can I go from your Spirit
Any place that I choose to go You're already there
And if I go to the heavens
If I rise on the wings of dawn
If I settle by the sea
I know Your hand is always there to guide me 
Where can I go from Your presence
When trouble is in my way You're already there
You will not go from my presence
Before a word of mine is said
If in the depths I lay my head
In the shadow of your wings You're there to hide me (oh hide me) 
Holy Spirit.

You ask me how I know that Jesus saves me,
How I know that all my sins are white as snow;
You ask me how I know that He forgave me;
Now listen, I must tell you how I know.
I was there when it happened, and I ought to know;
His Spirit burning in me, set my heart aglow;
So I praise the Lord today, He has washed my sins away;
I was there when it happened, and I ought to know.
You ask me how I know that He redeemed me;
And how I received the peace no gold can buy;
How from the guilt and pow’r of sin He saved me,
Made me an heir to mansions in the sky.
And now, as thru the world I go rejoicing,
I am telling what a Savior dwells within;
How I plunged into the cleansing, crimson fountain,
And Jesus washed my soul from ev’ry sin.

You can come as you are
You can come as you are (You can come as you are, have nothing to fear)

Just as you are (as you are)
You can lay your burdens here

Child, you have nothing to fear
Every night I see you cry
In perfect solitude
I keep whispering on the wind
That I am here for you
What will it take to get through to you?
Should I open up the sky?
Would you believe in miracles
Or would you say I lied?
What if I could ease your pain
By giving up my life
Would you let me hold you then
And leave the past behind?
You can come
Just as you are
You can lay your burdens here

There’s a God who’s standing at heaven’s door,
He’s looking this universe o’er;
And He sees each mortal with a searching eye,
You can’t do wrong and get by.
You can’t do wrong and get by,
No matter how much you may try;
Nothing hidden can be, everything He doth see,
You can’t do wrong and get by.
Out into the darkness you alone may go,
And seeds for the wicked one sow;
There’s an eye that’s watching from the throne on high,
You can’t do wrong and get by.
Yes, He knows yours secrets, everything you do,
He knows that your life is untrue;
You can ne’er deceive Him, there’s no use to try,
You can’t do wrong and get by.

There are many people who will say they're Christians
And they live like Christians on the Sabbath day
But come Monday morning 'til the coming Sunday
They will fight their neighbour all along the way
Oh you don't love God if you don't love your neighbour
If you gossip about him, if you never have mercy
If he gets into trouble and you don't try to help him
Then you don't love your neighbour and you don't love God
In the Holy Bible in the book of Matthew
Read the eighteenth chapter in the twenty-first verse
Jesus plainly tells us that we must have mercy
There's a special warning in the thirty-fifth verse
There's a God almighty and you've got to love Him
If you want salvation and a home on high
If you say you love Him while you hate your neighbour
Then you don't have religion, you just told a lie

Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I never done
It's been one hill after another
I've climbed them all one by one 
But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time 
My woman got tired of heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy 
But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time 

You gave us hope when You sent Your Son
True hope, perfect hope, pure hope
Into the darkness, Jesus has come
True hope, perfect hope, pure hope
Let Your light shine through us
to the nations
Let Your light shine through us
to the world, for 
You gave us hope when You sent Your Son
True hope, perfect hope, pure hope
Joy
Peace
Love

You have redeemed my soul from the pit of emptiness
You have redeemed my soul from death
I was a hungry child, a dried up river
I was a burned out forest, and no one could do anything for me
But You put food in my body, water in my dry bed
And to my blackened branches, You brought the springtime green
Of a new life
And nothing is impossible for You

You have wandered far on the desert lone,
And you face an awful fate,
For a storm is near and the night comes on—
Take the home-path ere too late.
Take the home-path, take the home-path,
Night is coming, do not wait;
Take the home-path, take the home-path,
Take the home-path ere too late.
You have been allured from the peaceful way
By your soul’s relentless foe;
Let the Savior true take your hand today,
For He knows the way to go.
While the chance is yours turn your back to sin,
Seeking pardon, humbly bow;
You’ve a soul to save and a crown to win,
And the time to start is now.

Well I can't imagine a good life without Jesus (without Jesus)
'Cause He gives life a purpose and make it real (yes, He makes it real)
And there's no way to describe the love that's between us (that's between us)
And for those who haven't found Him, here's how I feel (how I feel) 
And I know.
You haven't lived, haven't lived, haven't lived until you've had Jesus in your 
life (you may have run all around)
You may have run all around, you might have partied the town (it's still not 
there), but the joy is still not there
No, you cannot give, cannot give, cannot give like Jesus, who died to make you 
free (you ought to turn to the One)
So if you're lookin' for fun, you ought to turn to the One (you ought to turn to 
Him) for the joy that He can share 
There are way too many people who've heard about Him (heard about Him)
And don't know what they're missing and have lived without (they have lived 
without)
'Cause He's the only source of our contentment (our contentment)
And He can show what living is all about (all about) 
He can share with you the meaning of creation (of creation)
He can walk with you and show you how to live (He can show you just the way to 
live)
He can share with you His good news of Salvation (of Salvation)
He has given all He possibly can give (He can give) 
Don't you know.
You haven't lived, haven't lived, haven't lived until you've had Jesus in your 
life (you may have run all around)
You may have run all around, you might have partied the town (it's still not 
there), but the joy is still not there
No, you cannot give, cannot give, cannot give like Jesus, who died to make you 
free (you ought to turn to the One)
So if you're lookin' for fun, you ought to turn to the One (you ought to turn to 
Him) for the peace that He can
And the love that He can and the joy that He can share (you haven't lived, 
haven't lived until you've had Jesus in your life, yeah) 

You, living Christ, our eyes behold, 
amid your church appearing, 
all girt about your breast with gold
and bright apparel wearing; 
your countenance is burning light, 
a sun resplendent in its might: 
Lord Christ, we see your glory.
Your glorious feet have sought and found 
your own of every nation;
with everlasting voice you sound 
the call of our salvation; 
your eyes of flame still search and scan
the whole outspreading realm of man: 
Lord Christ, we see your glory.
O risen Christ, today alive, 
amid your Church abiding, 
who now your blood and body give, 
new life and strength providing, 
we join in heavenly company 
to sing your praise triumphantly: 
Lord Christ, we see your glory!

You may have the joy-bells ringing in your heart,
And a peace that from you never will depart;
Walk the straight and narrow way,
Live for Jesus ev’ry day,
He will keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.
Joy-bells ringing in your heart,
Joy-bells ringing in your heart;
Take the Savior here below
With you ev’rywhere you go;
He will keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.
Love of Jesus in its fullness you may know;
And this love to those around you sweetly show;
Words of kindness always say;
Deeds of mercy do each day,
Then He’ll keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.
You will meet with trials as you journey home;
Grace sufficient He will give to overcome;
Though unseen by mortal eye,
He is with you ever nigh,
And He’ll keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.
Let your life speak well of Jesus ev’ry day;
Own His right to ev’ry service you can pay;
Sinners you can help to win
If your life is pure and clean,
And you keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.

You may sing of the beauties of mountain and dale
Of the silvery streamlet and flow'rs of the vale
But the place most delightful this earth can afford,
Is the place of devotion--the house of the Lord.
You may boast of the sweetness of day's early dawn,
Of the sky's soft'ning graces when day is just gone;
But there's no other season or time can compare
With the house of devotion--the season of prayer.
You may value the friendships of youth and of age,
And select for my comrades the noble and sage;
But the friends that most cheer me on life's rugged road,
Are the friends of my Master--the children of God.
You may talk of your prospects of fame or of wealth,
And the hopes that oft flatter the fav'rites of health
But the hope of bright glory--of heavenly bliss!
Take away ev'ry other, and give me but this.
Ever hail, blessed temple, abode of my God,
I will turn to thee often to hear from thy word
I will walk to the altar with those that I love,
And delight in the prospect revealed from above.

Is your life full of trial, do you seek sweet peace?
You must be redeemed by the blood.
From the chains that have bound you would you find release?
You must be redeemed by the blood.
You must be redeemed, you must be redeemed,
You must be redeemed by the blood;
O trust and believe, salvation receive,
You must be redeemed by the blood.
Would you press on to glory with a Savior near?
You must be redeemed by the blood.
Would your soul rise in vict’ry over doubt and fear?
You must be redeemed by the blood.
Do you seek for His pardon lest your soul shall die?
You must be redeemed by the blood.
For His grace all sufficient doth your spirit cry?
You must be redeemed by the blood.

When you're living in this world of sin
You take everything, everything that you want
Never looking back to see just who you hurt
You know Satan's got a hold, got a hold on your heart
Look inside yourself and see just who you are
Let the Savior show you how, show you how to live
If you give your heart to Jesus you can see
That you really got a lot, got a lot to give 
You need love, real love, His love, God's wonderful love
You need love, real love, His love, God's wonderful love 
Let your Savior have a hold of your life
And He's never gonna let, gonna let you go
Praise him for his Spirit that he's given you
Through His word His love for you, for you He'll show 
Let Him take you higher than you'll ever know
With His love your heart will , it will never break
Peace that passes understanding in your soul
You will only want to give instead of take 
You need love, real love (real love), His love (His love), God's wonderful love
You need love, real love (real love), His love (His love), God's wonderful love

I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,
He is a Savior tender and true;
Jesus, my King—how I adore Him!
And He should be as precious to you.
I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,
Will you receive His greeting today?
Waiting He stands, tenderly pleading:
“I am the Life, the Truth, and the Way."
I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,
He is a faithful Shepherd and Guide;
Sorrow He shares, burdens He lightens,
Ev’ry good thing by Him is supplied.
I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,
Will you not let Him enter your heart?
Peace He will give you without measure,
Blessing untold, that will not depart.

Jesus Christ has come to set the captive free,
He died to take away death’s sting;
His blood as a ransom He gave for thee,
Then praise to Him you ought to sing.
You ought to sing to the Lamb
Who has washed us in His blood;
He’s our Lord and our King;
To His name you ought to sing.
Jesus came our sorrows and our griefs to bear,
What love divine, oh, praise His name;
He says, “Cast on Me all thy load of care,"
Then praise to Him you ought to sing.
Sinner, come to Jesus and be saved today,
His blood can cleanse the crimson stain;
He’s ready to wash all your sins away;
Then praise to Him you ought to sing.
If you will be faithful through this pilgrim land,
And live to glorify His name,
You’ll find a sweet welcome at His right hand;
Then praise to Him you ought to sing.

I found it hard to believe someone like you cared for me
You put this love in my heart
I tried but could not refuse, you gave me no time to lose
You put this love in my heart
I want to know where the bad feelings go (feelings go)
When I'm depressed and I get down so low
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright (it's alright)
I want to tell you right now, I'm not afraid to say how
You put this love in my heart.
There are sometimes when I doubt, but you always find me out 
You put this love in my heart
Cause when I see all that you've done for me (done for me)
It's hard to doubt, I just have to believe
Cause you followed up, proven all your love
Well I know the loneliness I had before (oh I had before),
Is gone now, I'll never feel it anymore,
Cause your love has released me from all that's in my past,
And I know I can believe you,
When you say I'll never be forsaken, Your love is gonna last (gotta believe your 
love, it will last)
There's so much more I could say, if I could just find a way
You put this love in my heart
Is this real or a dream, I feel so good I could scream
You put this love in my heart.
I want to know where the bad feelings go (feelings go)
When I'm depressed and I get down so low
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright (it's alright)
You put this love in my heart
You put this love in my heart, yeah, you put this love in my heart (fade)

You said, "Ask and you will receive whatever you need."
You said, "Pray and I'll hear from heaven,
And I'll heal your land."
You said Your glory will fill the earth
Like water the sea.
You said, "Lift up your eyes;
The harvest is here, the kingdom is near.
You said, "Ask and I'll give the nations to you."
O Lord, that's the cry of my heart.
Distant shores and the islands will see
Your light as it rises on us.
O Lord, I ask for the nations.
O Lord, I ask for the nations.

Je - - - sus, you are my shelter
In you I find hope 
In you I find peace 
Though I stumble, your love never falters
In you I find grace 
In you I find strength
You are my rock of refuge and you shelter me
You shelter me
In the darkest of nights, through the stormiest seas
The light of your love is a beacon of safety to me
You shelter me
Jesus, you are a strong tower
All my enemies flee
When I call on your name 
You are my rock of refuge and you shelter me

Why should I fear man when you made the heavens
Why should I be afraid when you put the stars in place
Why should I loose heart when I know how great you are
Why should I give up when your plans are full of love
In this world we will have trouble
But you have overcome the world
You shine brighter than the brightest star
Your love purer than the purest heart
You shine filling us with courage and strength to follow you

You that have spent the silent night
In sleep and quiet rest,
And joy to see the cheerful light
That riseth in the east,
Now clear your voice, now cheer your heart,
Come, help me now to sing;
Each willing wight, come bear a part,
To praise the heavenly King.
And you whom care in prison keeps
Or sickness doth suppress,
Or secret sorrow breaks your sleeps
Or dolours to distress:
Yet bear a part in humble wise,
Yea, think it good accord,
And full and fitting sacrifice
Each soul to praise the Lord.
Unto His joys for to attain
God grant us all His grace,
And send us after worldly pain
In Heav’n to have a place;
Where we may still enjoy that light
Which never shall decay:
Lord, for Thy mercy lend us might
To see that joyful day.

It's my turn, it's not your turn
It's my turn, get outta my way
It's my turn, go on complain
I'm coming through anyway
Don't ask me why I'm like this
But lately I'm wonderin' if
It'll come to pass
That the last shall be first and
The first shall be last.
The the voice says.
Here's the way it oughtta be
You then me then you then me
Well, I pray one day we'll all agree
And take it you then me then you then me
Life could go you then me then you then me
It's easy, you wait then go
It's easy, so make your move
It's easy, don't clown around
Coulda gone six times by now
But no sir you gotta be a pain
Or is this your way of sayin
We should all cool down
And be more like the man who was
Born back in Bethlehem town?
I betcha he'd say.
If we could only put You first
Maybe this ugly trend could one day be reversed
Same as other times
It's your turn, it's not my turn
It's your turn-well let's just say
We'll trade off-first you then me
Then after that we'll all agree
Same as other times
Let's try it, it could be good
And what if, one day it should
Really come to pass
That the last shall be first and the first shall be last
Betcha we'd say:

You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming
In a few more days.
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
Which is sounding thro’ the air.
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet
In a few more days.
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising
In a few more days.
Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior
In a few more days.
Then we’ll shout, our suff’rings over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’rings over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’rings over
In a few more days.

If you say you don't believe it (don't believe it)
There is one thing you should know
There's a day that you will need it (you will need it)
When the final trump will blow 
You'll find you'll have no choice
The truth will take your voice and say His name 
Jesus (Jesus) ...Christ is the Messiah
Jesus (Jesus) ...Son of God on high
Jesus (Jesus) ...Every tongue will sing (sing it)
Jesus (Jesus) ...Christ the King of kings 
If you say, "Maybe tomorrow
I don't have a need today"
There's a day that's filled with sorrow
For the child who fell away (away, away, away, away) 
You'll feel it in your heart
Your lips can only start to say His name 
When the saved of the earth shall gather
There upon the other shore
We will sing (we will sing) the name of Jesus
Like we never have before 
With joyous voices raised
Forever we will praise His Holy Name 
Everyone will bow (everyone will bow)
Every knee to the ground (to the ground)
Every voice will be the same (every voice will be the same)
Everyone will say His name 
Everyone
Every knee
Every voice
Everyone will say His name

Even oceans and their waves
Bow at your feet

And you love me as I am
You have called me chosen
For your kingdom
Unashamed to call me your own

When I cannot speak
Your blood says everything
In the presence of perfect love
I am too weak
Your blood says everything
Your blood says everything
Hear the word
Spoken from the tree
Heaven broken open
Your blood says everything
Your blood says everything

Thine arm, O Lord, in days of old,
was strong to heal and save;
It triumphed over disease and death,
over darkness and the grave.
To Thee they went, the blind, the dumb,
the palsied and the lame,
The leper with his tainted life,
the sick with fevered frame.
And lo! Thy touch brought life and health,
gave speech, and strength and sight;
And youth renewed and fear relieved
owned Thee, the Lord of light;
And now, O Lord, be near to bless,
Almighty as of yore,
In crowded street, by restless couch,
as by Gennesaret's shore.
Be Thou our great Deliverer still,
Thou Lord of life and death;
Restore and quicken, soothe and bless,
with Thine almighty breath.
To hands that work and eyes that see,
give wisdom's heavenly lore,
That whole and sick, and weak and strong,
may praise Thee evermore.

Your harps, ye trembling saints,
Down from the willows take;
Loud to the praise of love divine
Bid every string awake.
Though in a foreign land
We are not far from home,
And nearer to our house above
We every moment come.
His grace will to the end
Stronger and brighter shine;
Nor present things nor things to come
Shall quench the spark divine.
When we in darkness walk,
Nor feel the heavenly flame,
Then is the time to trust our God,
And rest upon His Name.
Soon shall our doubts and fears
Subside at His control;
His lovingkindness shall break through
The midnight of the soul.
Blest is the man, O Lord!
That stays himself on Thee;
Who wait for Thy salvation, Lord!
Shall thy salvation see.

In very nature God made nothing of yourself
Your love is amazing
Stepping into time you took the form of man
Your love is amazing (2 times)
How great is the love of God
Your body broken on the cross 
How great was the price you paid
Your love is so amazing
How great was the gift of love
My freedom bought with sinless blood
How great was my debt you paid
Your love is so amazing
Your love is so amazing to me
King of glory come a servant of us all
Your love is amazing
Lived a perfect life died a sinners' death
Your love is amazing (2 times)

Your love, oh Lord reaches to the heavens
And Your faithfulness stretches to the sky
And Your righteousness is like the mighty mountain yeh
And Your justice flows like the ocean’s tide
And I will lift my voice to worship You my King
And I will find my strength in the shadow of Your wings
And I will lift my voice to worship You my King (I will lift my voice to worship 
You my King)
And I will find my strength in the shadow of Your wings (And I will find my 
strength in the shadow of Your wings)
Your love, oh Lord reaches to the heavens
Your faithfulness stretches to the sky

You are the fountain of my life
And in your light I find my reason
('Cause) Your love reaches to the stars
Even the great deep
(And) Your love reaches to this heart
And it makes me sing
Your love reaches me
It's what I need
It's what I need
Your love reaches me
It's what I need
It's what I need
Oh Lord, how priceless
Is your unending love
Both high and low
Find refuge in your shadow

If you cannot, on the ocean, sail among the swiftest fleet,
Rocking on the highest billows, laughing at the storms you meet,
You can stand among the sailors, anchored yet within the bay,
You can lend a hand to help them, as they launch their boats away.
If you are too weak to journey up the mountain steep and high,
You can stand within the valley, while the multitudes go by;
You can chant in happy measure, as they slowly pass along;
Though they may forget the singer, they will not forget the song.
If you have not gold and silver ever ready to command;
If you cannot toward the needy reach an ever open hand;
You can visit the afflicted, o’er the erring you can weep;
You can be a true disciple, sitting at the Savior’s feet.
If you cannot, in the conflict prove, yourself a soldier true,
If, where fire and smoke are thickest, there’s no work for you to do;
When the battlefield is silent, you can go with careful tread,
You can bear away the wounded, you can cover up the dead.
If you cannot, in the harvest, gather up the richest sheaves,
Many a grain both ripe and golden oft the careless reaper leaves;
Go and glean among the briars growing rank against the wall,
For it may be that their shadow hides the heaviest wheat of all.
Do not, then, stand idly waiting, for some greater work to do;
Fortune is a lazy goddess, she will never come to you.
Go and toil in any vineyard, do not fear to do or dare,
If you want a field of labor, you can find it anywhere.

You are the sovereign "I Am"
Your name is holy
You are the pure spotless lamb
Your name is holy
You are the Almighty One
Your name is holy
You are the Christ, God's own Son
Your name is holy
In Your name, there is mercy for sin
There is safety within
In Your holy name
In Your name, there is strength to remain
To stand in spite of pain
In Your holy name

There's a swing on the back porch where I sit in the morning
when the sun is slowly rising with a Bible on my knee 
and at the last swallow of coffee 
I'll just sit there in your presence for awhile 
and let your spirit come and move all over me
Thank you Lord for everything you've given me.
You've provided every need both big and small
and more than all of the blessing that you pour out everyday,
Your presence is my favorite gift of all
Sometimes late at night when the kids are asleep, 
I'll go out into the yard and just listen to the night
and I can fee your holy spirit as a whipporwill leads nature in a praise
song
and every critter in the forest seems to cryout.
More than all of the blessings that you pour out everyday,
your presence is my favorite gift of all

When the darkness fills my senses,
When my blindness keeps me from Your touch,
Jesus come.
When my burden keeps me doubting,
When my memories take the place of You,
Jesus come.
And I'll follow You there
To the place where we meet,
And I'll lay down my pride
As You search me again.
Your unfailing love, 
Your unfailing love,
Your unfailing love over me again.

You're so wonderful so wonderful to me
I give my heart to you, I bare my very soul
I give my love to you there's nothing I withhold
You're so wonderful to me
I give my hopes to you and all my earthly schemes
I live each day for you as foolish as it seems
You're so wonderful to me
You're so wonderful so wonderful to me (2x)
You gave your life for me when I was far from you
To live my life for you is the least that I can do
I love you my Lord Jesus
You're so wonderful so wonderful to me

You've kept watch over me since I was a child
You've stayed close when my heart has gone running wild
You've welcomed me back again and again
You've offered your kindness, forgiven my sin
You're the source of all the good gifts I know
No one else can equal the love you show
Though my praise for you often comes so slow
How I long for my life with you to grow
In your actions you show the proof of your care
In your presence comes comfort, you're ev'rywhere
In your mercy I find hope that will last
In your second life I am saved from my past.

Yours is the greatness
Yours is the power
Yours is the glory alone.
The majesty and splendor
The wealth and the honor
The strength and the wisdom, O Lord
You are exalted as head over all
Praise to Your glorious name
Everything in heaven and earth is Yours
Forever Your kingdom will reign,
You reign.You reign ! You reign !!

You've got to go, go tell what the Lord has done for you (go and tell it)
You've got to go, go tell what the Lord has done for you (go and tell it)

You've got to go, go tell what the Lord has done for you (go, done for you)
In Matthew, Mark, and Luke we find the story of the time when all the water near 
the land of Gerasenes
The disciples were with Jesus when they heard some awful moaning and the holler 
came from back behind the trees
The man had lived among the tombs but chains could not subdue him, but night and 
day he cut himself and cried
Right away the demons knew the majesty among them for the Son of God was easily 
recognized
The demons that were in him had become so panic stricken driving him out of his 
right and normal mind
But the previous location must have been so very awful 'cause they begged the 
Lord to put them in the swine
The plan was not effective for the pigs began a-runnin' and their destination 
was catastrophe
Once the stampede had got started there was just know way to stop it and the 
pigs began to fly into the sea
The people of the region came to see the brand new Legion, out of chains and 
acting like an average Joe
Sitting there beside the preacher and with one outstanding feature - he was 
actually even wearing clothes
But the people became frightened and began to plead with Jesus, "We were better 
off before you even came"
But Legion begged to differ and he wanted to go with him -the one who changed 
him from lunatic to sain

Zion mourns in fear and anguish,
Zion, city of our God.
“Ah," she says, “how sore I languish,
Bowed beneath the chast’ning rod!
For my God forsook me quite
And forgot my sorry plight
Mid these troubles now distressing,
Countless woes my soul oppressing.
“Once," she mourns, “He promised plainly
That His help should e’er be near;
Yet I now must seek Him vainly
In my days of woe and fear.
Will His anger never cease?
Will He not renew His peace?
Will He not show forth compassion
And again forgive transgression?"
“Let not Satan make thee craven;
He can threaten but not harm.
On My hands thy name is graven,
And thy shield is My strong arm.
How, then, could it ever be
I should not remember thee,
Fail to build thy walls, My city,
And look down on thee with pity?
“Ever shall Mine eyes behold thee;
On My bosom thou art laid.
Ever shall My love enfold thee;
Never shalt thou lack Mine aid.
Neither Satan, war, nor stress
Then shall mar thy happiness:
With this blessed consolation
Be thou firm in tribulation."

Zion, to Thy Savior singing,
To thy Prince and Shepherd bringing,
Sweetest hymns of love and praise,
Thou wilt never reach the measure
Of His worth, by all the treasure
Of thy most ecstatic lays.
Of all wonders that can thrill thee,
And, with adoration fill thee,
What than this can greater be,
That Himself to thee He giveth?
He that eateth ever liveth,
For the Bread of Life is He.
Fill thy lips to overflowing
With sweet praise, His mercy showing
Who this heav’nly table spread:
On this day so glad and holy,
To each longing spirit lowly
Giveth He the living Bread.
Here the King hath spread His table,
Whereon eyes of faith are able
Christ our Passover to trace:
Shadows of the law are going,
Light and life and truth inflowing,
Night to day is giving place.
O Good Shepherd, Bread life giving,
Us, Thy grace and life receiving,
Feed and shelter evermore;
Thou on earth our weakness guiding,
We in Heav’n with Thee abiding,
With all saints will Thee adore.

Zion's daughters! Sons of Jerusalem!
All ye hosts of heavenly chivalry!
Lift your voices, singing right merrily
alleluia!
Christ our Savior weds on this festival
holy Church, the pattern of righteousness,
whom from depths of uttermost misery
he hath rescued.
Now the Bride receiveth his benison,
tasteth now the joys of the Paraclete;
kings and queens with jubilant melody
call her blessed.
Mother meet for sinful humanity,
life's sure haven, rest for the sorrowful,
strong protectress, born a mystery,
ever wondrous.
Not more fair the moon in her loveliness!
Not more bright the sun in his majesty!
Like an army splendid and terrible,
ranged for battle.
So the Church shines forth on her pilgrimage,
signed with Jordan's waters of penitence,
drawn to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
from the world's end.
"So, foretold by figures and prophecies,
clothed in nuptial vesture of charity,
joined with Christ, o'er heaven's glad citizens
now she reigneth.
"Welcome! feast of light and felicity,
Bride to Bridegroom joining in unity;
in her mystic marriage is typified
our salvation."
Christ, whose joys we joyfully celebrate,
grant us all a place with thy chosen ones,
true delights, ineffable happiness,
rest eternal.

Zion’s King shall reign victorious,
All the earth shall own His sway;
He will make His kingdom glorious,
He will reign through endless day.
Mighty King, Thine arm revealing,
Now Thy glorious cause maintain,
Bring the nations help and healing,
Make them subject to Thy reign.
Nations now from God estranged,
Then shall see a glorious light,
Night to day shall then be changed,
Heaven shall triumph in the sight.
Then shall Israel, long dispersed,
Mourning seek the Lord their God,
Look on Him Whom once they pierced,
Own and kiss the chastening rod.

In the land of Galilee,
Look! what is it that we see?
Surely, something more than common is at hand;
Multitudes of people pass,
’Tis a mighty, moving mass,
Moved by pow’r that’s more than mortal to command.
Forward, forward are they marching,
As the years still come and go;
As they’re marching hear them sing,
“We are following our King,
He’s our Leader and no other will we know." 
Eighteen hundred years and more,
Land to land, from shore to shore,
With the King of glory always in the lead;
Through the fire and through the blood,
Persecution’s awful flood,
Thins their ranks, but still they onward do proceed.
Through the darkness, through the light,
Through twelve hundred years of night,
But the morning of the day doth now appear;
See the mighty blood-washed throng,
Marching on with shout and song,
The full day of final vict’ry draweth near.
Through the dark and cloudy day
They’re still marching on their way,
See their numbers are increasing more and more;
The three days and half are past,
Light sublime has come at last—
’Tis revealing that the cloudy day is o’er.
Now they’ve reached the evening light,
Clothed in robes of snowy white,
Still they’re marching on to certain victory;
Satan’s hosts they now defy,
“God has conquered!" hear them cry,
As they reach the borders of eternity.

Lord what can I do for You
I know I'm helpless on my own
Before You came I was alone, so alone
Now draw me close to You
I know Your Spirit set me free
From the sin inside of me, inside of me
You've given me life Lord
Now show me how to live this new life for you any way I can.
A brand new life Lord
Now all I want to do is lie it gentlyin Your hands
Hey won't You come down to me
You know I need Your healing power
Shine down Your love on me this hour, on me this hour
Lord, You've given me everything
Every blessing that I need
I will follow where You lead, where You lead
You've given me life Lord
Now show me how to live this new life for you any way I can.
A brand new life Lord
all I want to do is lie it gentlyin Your hands
Thank You Lord I'm Yours

Thank You for the day that You've just brought me through
All the perfect ways You've met my needs
Though I am unworthy to receive from You,
You've blessed me Lord, how You've blessed me Lord
May my dreams be holy
Tomorrow may I know you in a closer way
How sweet it is to be living in Your presence
Through the day, o o o o o o o o o o o o o o


Jesus, gracious One, calleth now to thee,
 “Come, O sinner, come!"
Calls so tenderly, calls so lovingly,
 “Now, O sinner, come!"
Words of peace and blessing,
Christ’s own love confessing;

A gladsome hymn of praise we sing,
And thankfully we gather
To bless the love of God above,
Our everlasting Father.
In Him rejoice with heart and voice
Whose glory fadeth never,
Whose providence is our defense,
Who lives and loves forever.
From shades of night He calls the light,
And from the sod the flower;
From every cloud His blessings break
In sunshine or in shower.
Full in His sight His children stand,
By His strong arm defended,
And He Whose wisdom guides the world,
Our footsteps hath attended.
For nothing falls unknown to Him,
Or care or joy or sorrow,
And He Whose mercy ruled the past
Will be our stay tomorrow.
Then praise the Lord with one accord,
To His great Name give glory,
And of His never changing love

Do you hear them coming, brother,
Thronging up the steeps of light,
Clad in glorious shining garments,
Blood washed, garments pure and white?
’Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
’Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.
Do you hear the stirring anthems,
Filling all the earth and sky,
’Tis a grand, victorious army,
Lift its banner up on high!
Never fear the clouds of sorrow,
Never fear the storms of sin.
We shall triumph on the morrow,
Even now our joys begin.
Wave the banner, shout His praises,
For our victory is nigh!
We shall join our conqu’ring Savior,
We shall reign with Him on high!

A glorious day is dawning,
And o’er the waking earth
The heralds of the morning
Are springing into birth.
In dark and hidden places
There shines the blessed light;
The beam of truth displaces
The darkness of the night.
The advocates of error
Foresee the glorious morn,
And hear in shrinking terror,
The watchword of reform:
It rings from hill and valley,
It breaks oppression’s chain.
A thousand freemen rally,
And swell the mighty strain.
The watchword has been spoken,
The light has broken forth,
Far shines the blessed token
Upon the startled earth,
To hearts and homes benighted,
The blessed Truth is given,
And peace and love, united,
Point upward unto Heav’n.

Gabriel, from the Heaven descending,
On the faithful Word attending,
Is in holy converse blending
With the virgin full of grace:
That good word and sweet he plighteth
In the bosom where it lighteth,
And for Eva Ave writeth,
Changing Eva’s name and race.
At the promise that he sendeth
God the Incarnate Word descendeth;
Yet no carnal touch offendeth
Her, the undefiled one.
She, without a father, beareth,
She no bridal union shareth,
And a painless birth declareth
That she bare the Royal Son.
Tale that wondering search entices!
But believe—and that suffices;
It is not for man’s devices
Here to pry with gaze unmeet:
High the sign, its place assuming
In the bush, the unconsuming:
Mortal, veil thine eyes presuming,
Loose thy shoes from off thy feet.
As the rod, by wondrous power,
Moistened not by dew or shower,
Bare the almond and the flower,
Thus He came, the virgin’s fruit:
Hail the Fruit, O world, with gladness!
Fruit of joy and not of sadness:
Adam had not lapsed to madness
Had he tasted of its shoot.
Jesus, kind above all other,
Gentle Child of gentle mother,
In the stable born our Brother,
Whom the angelic hosts adore:
He, once cradled in a manger,
Heal our sin and calm our danger;
For our life, to this world stranger,
Is in peril evermore.

Gabriel to Mary came,
She saw him in her chamber;
Mary's heart stood still with fear,
But gently did he greet her:
'Thou queen of maidens, hail!' he said,
'Thou shalt become a Mother-maid;
Thy Son shall be the Lord of earth and heaven:
He comes to save mankind
That men, their sins forgiven,
The gate of heaven may find.'
'How can I a mother be
That am a maid unwedded?
How can I a mother be
That am a maid betrothed?'
He answered to her questioning:
'The Holy Ghost shall do this thing.
Be not afraid, nor let thy heart be careful:
God guards thy purity;
His power shall make thee joyful,
And blessed shalt thou be.'
Unto whom our Lady then
Returned her answer meekly:
'Here I am, the handmaiden
Of God the Lord almighty;
O messenger of God most high,
Revealer of this mystery,
With all my heart I long to see fulfilment
Of what I hear thee tell:
Behold his handmaid ready
To do his holy will.'
Ah, thou Mother of my Lord,
What peace through thee was given!
Thy dear Child, our Christ adored,
Makes peace in earth and heaven.
Beseech thy Son for us, that he
Would look upon us graciously,
And all our shame and misery relieving,
Would give us grace to come
To comfort out of grieving
And, out of exile, home.

Gabriel's message does away
Satan's curse and Satan's sway,
out of darkness brings our Day:
so, behold,
all the gates of heaven unfold.
He that comes despised shall reign;
he that cannot die, be slain;
death by death its death shall gain: 
Weakness shall the strong confound;
by the hands, in grave clothes wound,
Adam's chains shall be unbound.
By the sword that was his own,
by that sword, and that alone,
shall Goliath be o'erthrown: 
Art by art shall be assailed;
to the cross shall Life be nailed;
from the grave shall hope be hailed: 

Lift up the Gates of Praise,
That we may enter in,
And o’er Salvation’s walls proclaim
That Christ redeems from sin.
The stars may praise the Hand
That decks the sky above,
But man alone can tell the power
Of Christ’s redeeming love.
God’s works reveal His might,
His majesty and grace;
But not the tender Father’s love
That saves a dying race.
Then let the voice of praise
To heav’nly courts ascend,
Till with the songs the angels sing
Our hallelujahs blend.
To Him that hath redeemed
Our souls from sin’s dark maze;
The Hope and Savior of mankind,
Be everlasting praise.

Galilee, bright Galilee,
Hallowed thoughts we turn to thee!
Woven through thy history,
Gleams the charming mystery
Of the life of One Who came,
Bearing grief, reproach and shame,
Savior of the world to be;
“God with us" by Galilee.
Once along that rugged shore
He, Who all our sorrows bore,
Journeyed oft with weary feet,
Through the storm or burning heat;
Healing all who came in faith,
Calling back to life from death;
King of kings from heaven was He,
Though so poor by Galilee!
Wild the night on Galilee;
Loudly roared the angry sea,
When upon the tossing wave
Jesus walked, His own to save:
Calmed the tumult by His will,
Only saying, “Peace, be still!"
Ruler of the storm was He,
On the raging Galilee!
Still in loving tenderness
Doth the Master wait to bless;
Still His touch upon the soul
Bringeth balm and maketh whole;
Still He comforts mourning hearts,
Life, and joy, and peace imparts;
Still the Friend of all is He,
As of old by Galilee!

There's a sacred and hallowed retreat, Where my soul finds a fellowship 
sweet.Where the Lord of my life I may meet.In the garden of my heart.
In the cool of the day He walks with me.In the rose-bordered way, He talks 
with me.In love's holy union and sacred communion, In the garden of my 
heart.
There is naught can disturb or molest.There my spirit finds comfort and 
rest.And my soul is no longer distressed, In the garden of my heart.
()
Shut away from earth's strife and its din, And protected from soul 
staining 
sin, For my Savior is dwelling within, In the garden of my heart.
()
There the dove of sweet peace always sings, And my faith ever trustingly 
clings.And the chime of sweet happiness rings, In the garden of my heart.

At the feet of the Blessed Master
We would lay our garnered sheaves;
When we come, and all empty handed,
Surely sore the Master grieves!
Garnered sheaves from the fields so white to harvest!
Garnered sheaves richly yields life’s golden harvest!
At the feet of the Blessed Master
We would lay our garnered sheaves.
While the fields then are white with harvest,
And the laborers are few,
Let us strive well to fill the garner,
And be reapers staunch and true.
O the joy of successful labor!
O the joy of work well done!
O the joy of the Master’s praises
To the soul whose crown is won!

What music celestial, what melody clear
Is this which is greeting with rapture my ear?
The gates are ajar in the mansions on high
And angels are chanting their songs in the sky.
Is Heaven so near me, the hope of my soul,
That over my spirit its music may roll?
Oh, bliss without measure, immortal and sweet!
I would that such cadence my voice could repeat! 

Open unto me
The gates of righteousness
That I might enter in
And I will praise You (I will praise You)
Open unto me
The gates of righteousness
That I might enter in
(And) I will praise You, praise You;
I will praise You, Lord
With all my heart.
I will praise You, Lord
With all my mind.
I will praise You, Lord
With all my soul.
With my strength will I praise You.
With my life will I praise You, Lord.

Gates of the beautiful, golden and bright,
Guarding that city of splendor and light;
Oft I behold thee, in distance and dream,
Flash in the sunlight of heavenly gleam.
Gates ajar for me, beautiful gates ajar for me;
City of gold with joys untold,
Beautiful gates ajar for me.
Gates of the beautiful, lofty and grand,
Swung by the touch of some bright angel hand;
Down form the portals there floats a sweet song,
Waked by the lips of the purified throng.
Gates of the beautiful, gates of pure gold,
How can I picture your glories untold?
Eagerly yearning my spirit doth wait
Till I shall come to the beautiful gate.

Gather around the Christmas tree!
Gather around the Christmas tree!
Evergreen have its branches been,
It is king of all the woodland scene;
For Christ our King is born today!
His reign shall never pass away.
Hosanna, hosanna,
Hosanna in the highest!
Gather around the Christmas tree!
Gather around the Christmas tree!
Once the pride of the mountainside,
Now cut down to grace our Christmastide;
For Christ from Heav’n to earth came down,
To gain, through death, a nobler crown.
Gather around the Christmas tree!
Gather around the Christmas tree!
Every bough bears a burden now—
They are gifts of love for us, we trow;
For Christ is born, His love to show,
And give good gifts to men below.
Farewell to thee, O Christmas tree!
Farewell to thee, O Christmas tree!
Twelve months o’er, we shall meet once more,
Merry welcome singing, as of yore,
For Christ now reigns, our Savior dear,
And gives us Christmas every year!

Gathered here in that great Presence,
Every earthly light grows dim:
Angels fall in dread and reverence,
Men redeemed take up the hymn:
Holy, Holy,
Holy is that Sacred Name!
Awed to silence by His power,
Prostrate millions ’wait His Word,
They, the creatures of an hour,
He, the everlasting Lord!
Holy, Holy,
Holy is that Sacred Name!
Goodness finds its good within Him!
Truth finds truth upon His tongue!
He is Beauty of all Beauty,
Let His praise be ever sung!
Holy, Holy,
Holy is that Sacred Name!
All must do what You require,
For Your Law remains the same:
Give our hearts a great desire
For the hallowing of Your Name!
Holy, Holy,
Holy is That Sacred Name!
GATHERED HERE IN THAT GREAT PRESENCE 

O list to the music that floats on the air,
The valleys are smiling, the reapers are there;
The summer rewards us with plenty again;
Then thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.
Gather the grain, gather the grain;
Thanks for the sunshine, the dew, and the rain;
Sunshine is yielding its harvest again,
Then thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.
O why should we tarry from labor today?
The reapers are calling, and we must away;
The sky is unclouded and soft is the wind;
The bright sheaves are waving and ready to bind.
We ask of the Master, our strength to renew,
Tho’ great is the harvest, the toilers are few;
We pray that to others His grace He may give,
To work and be faithful as long as they live.
The harvest is passing, to greet us no more,
The summer is ending, and soon will be o’er;
Our moments neglected, return not again—
Now thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.

Gather them in! for yet there is room
At the feast that the King has spread;
O gather them in! let His house be filled,
And the hungry and poor be fed.
Out in the highway, out in the byway,
Out in the dark paths of sin,
Go forth, go forth, with a loving heart,
And gather the wanderers in!
Gather them in! for yet there is room;
But our hearts—how they throb with pain;
To think of the many who slight the call
That may never be heard again.
Gather them in! for yet there is room;
’Tis a message from God above;
O gather them into the fold of grace,
And the arms of the Savior’s love.

Gather us in, Thou Love that fillest all;
Gather our rival faiths within Thy fold;
Rend each man’s temple veil, and bid it fall,
That we may know that Thou hast been of old.
Gather us in—we worship only Thee;
In varied names we stretch a common hand;
In diverse forms a common soul we see;
In many ships we seek one spirit land.
Thine is the mystic life great India craves;
Thine is the Parsee’s sin-destroying beam;
Thine is the Buddhist’s rest from tossing waves;
Thine is the empire of vast China’s dream.
Thine is the Roman’s strength without his pride;
Thine is the Greek’s glad world without its graves;
Thine is Judea’s law with love beside,
The truth that censures and the grace that saves.
Some seek a Father in the heav’ns above;
Some ask a human image to adore;
Some crave a spirit vast as life and love;
Within Thy mansions we have all and more.

We are gathered in your name
Calling on you Lord
Come anoint us with your flame
Come oh blessed Son
Let us dwell in your presence
Be the throne room of our hearts
Be the anchor of our longing
'Til our hearts find rest in you
As we bow before your throne
Lifting holy hands
We give praise to you alone
Come oh spirit come
And be the anchor of my longin
'Til my heart finds rest in you

Up to the bountiful Giver of life,
Gathering home! gathering home!
Up to the dwelling where cometh no strife,
The dear ones are gathering home.
Gathering home! Gathering home!
Never to sorrow more, never to roam.
Gathering home! Gathering home!
God’s children are gathering home!
Up to the city where falleth no night,
Gathering home! gathering home!
Up where the Savior’s own face is the light,
The dear ones are gathering home.
Up to the beautiful mansions above,
Gathering home! gathering home!
Safe in the arms of His infinite love,
The dear ones are gathering home.

Steer our bark away to the homeland,
Spread the sails of hope o’er the sea;
Think of all the friends that await us,
When anchored safely there we shall be.
Gathering out of tears into sunshine,
Gathering out of labor into rest;
Hear the ransomed throng shouting forth their joy in song,
Gathering to the mansions of the blest.
Steer our bark away to the homeland,
On without a fear let us go;
When the port of peace we are nearing,
The blessed harbor lights we shall know.
Bright and fair the hills of the homeland,
Clad in all the bloom of the spring;
There to Him Who loved and redeemed us,
Our joyful, joyful praise we will sing.
Soft the winds that blow from the homeland,
Sweet the morn that breaks on the shore;
Soon we’ll meet again our beloved ones,
Where sorrow’s plaintive moan comes no more.

I love you Father
I love you Lord
I will surrender to my Savior
And fall into your gentle arms of love
And I will be where I belong
And you will hold me in your gentle loving arms
And I will stay where I belong
And you will hold me in your gentle loving arms

The Gentle Healer came into our town today
He touched blind eyes and the darkness left to stay
But more than the blindness, He took their sins away
The Gentle Healer came into our town today
The Gentle Healer came into our town today
He spoke one word that was all He had to say
And the one who had died just rose up straight away
The Gentle Healer came into our town today
Oh, He seems like just an ordinary man
With dirty feet and rough but gentle hands
But the words He says are hard to understand
And, yet, He seems like just an ordinary man
The Gentle Healer, He left our town today
I just looked around and found He'd gone away
Some folks from town had followed Him, they say
That the Gentle Healer is the Truth, the Life, the Way
Yes the Gentle Healer is the Truth, the Life, the Way

Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
Look upon a little child;
Pity my simplicity,
Suffer me to come to Thee.
Lamb of God, I look to Thee;
Thou shalt my Example be;
Thou art gentle, meek, and mild;
Thou wast once a little child.
Lord, I would be as Thou art;
Give me Thine obedient heart;
Thou art pitiful and kind,
Let me have Thy loving mind.
Let me, above all, fulfill
God my heav’nly Father’s will;
Never His good Spirit grieve;
Only to His glory live.
Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,
In Thy gracious hands I am;
Make me, Savior, what Thou art,
Live Thyself within my heart.

Gentle Mary laid her Child lowly in a manger;
There He lay, the undefiled, to the world a Stranger:
Such a Babe in such a place, can He be the Savior?
Ask the saved of all the race who have found His favor.
Angels sang about His birth; wise men sought and found Him;
Heaven’s star shone brightly forth, glory all around Him:
Shepherds saw the wondrous sight, heard the angels singing;
All the plains were lit that night, all the hills were ringing.
Gentle Mary laid her Child lowly in a manger;
He is still the undefiled, but no more a stranger:
Son of God, of humble birth, beautiful the story;
Praise His Name in all the earth, hail the King of glory!

Gentle Shepherd, gently lead us
Guide us through this earthly maze
When in devious paths we wander
Lead us in thy peaceful ways
When the dark clouds round us gather
Shutting out the light of day
Dearest Saviour, guide our footsteps
Lead us gently in the way.
Gentle Shepherd, lead us onward
Thro' a world of toil and strife
Cheer us with thy glorious presence
On the battle-field of life
Should some vision o'er our pathway
Turn our erring feet astray
Blessed Guardian, be thou near us
Lead us gently in thy way
Gentle Shepherd, lead us ever
In the way that we should go
Turn, O turn our wand'ring footsteps
From the paths that lead to woe.
And when earthly light is fading
Into light of heav'nly ray
Gentle Shepherd, lead us over
To the land of endless day.

Gentle Shepherd, Thou hast stilled
Now Thy little lamb’s brief weeping;
Ah, how peaceful, pale and mild,
In its narrow bed ’tis sleeping,
And no sigh of anguish sore
Heaves that little bosom more.
In this world of care and pain,
Lord, Thou wouldst no longer leave it;
To the sunny, heavenly plain
Thou dost now with joy receive it;
Clothed in robes of spotless white,
Now it dwells with Thee in light.
Ah, Lord Jesus, grant that we
Where it lives may soon be living,
And the lovely pastures see
That its heavenly food are giving;
Then the gain of death we prove,
Though Thou take what most we love.

Gently Lord, O gently lead us,
Pilgrims in this vale of tears,
Through the trials yet decreed us,
Till our last great change appears.
When temptation’s darts assail us,
When in devious paths we stray,
Let Thy goodness never fail us,
Lead us in Thy perfect way.
In the hour of pain and anguish,
In the hour when death draws near,
Suffer not our hearts to languish,
Suffer not our souls to fear;
And, when mortal life is ended,
Bid us in Thine arms to rest,
Till, by angel bands attended,
We awake among the blest.

Get right with God, why will you die?
Oh, weary one, for mercy cry;
No longer walk the downward road;
Oh, come away, get right with God.
Get right with God; get right with God;
Oh, come away, get right with God;
No longer walk the downward road;
Oh, come away, get right with God.
Get right with God—for you Christ died,
On Calvary’s cross was crucified;
His side was pierced, blood from it flowed;
Oh, come away, get right with God.
Get right with God, He loves you so;
No mother’s love could stoop so low;
On Christ He laid sin’s heavy load,
Oh, come away, get right with God.
Get right with God, your loved ones said
When lying on their dying bed;
But ah! you’ve wandered far abroad,
Oh, come away, get right with God.
Get right with God, confess your sin,
And let the dear Redeemer in;
He hath for you the winepress trod,
Oh, come away, get right with God.

I was busy minding my own business
Simply trying to stay on top of my game
Never thinking about consequences
Always finding me somebody to blame
But then it came together
When I read this letter
A message from somebody named Paul
He wrote of One who bought me
All the things he taught me
I really thought I'd heard it all
Get to the point: I will if you ask me
Get to the point how have you changed?
I was on sinking ground
Until He turned me around
And I know I'll never be the same
Get to the point: I'm trying to tell you
Get to the point what have you done?
It is not what I've done
But what He's doin' for me
And I know we've only just begun
We've only just begun
Now I'm busy mindin' my Father's business
Tryin' to do what He told me to
And I still have that wonderful letter
Knowin' every time I read it it's new
Today I never worry
My vision's never blurry
I've found Someone to handle the stress (Jesus)
I know you really need Him
So would you like to meet Him
I'm prayin' that the answer is yes
All your efforts will be in vain (No matter what you do)
Trying to save yourself will drive you insane (He sees you through and through)
Crossing that final change with confidence (I'm crossing that line)
Is what you can do through His providence

My Jesus, I would ne’er forget,
That hour I spent with Thee;
When there I saw Thy bloody sweat
In dark Gethsemane.
I’ll ne’er forget, I’ll ne’er forget,
I’ll ne’er forgetful be,
When there I saw Thy bloody sweat
In dark Gethsemane.
’Twas in that olive grove I felt
That Thou hadst died for me;
Alas, how great I saw my guilt
While in Gethsemane.
I thought of how Thy heart did throb,
While “all" Thine own did flee,
And left Thee with the cruel mob,
In sad Gethsemane.
’Twas there I felt my grief and shame
In oft forsaking Thee,
How precious was Thy very Name
In dear Gethsemane.
Should e’er our love to Thee grow cold,
And we forgetful be,
We’ll call to mind Thy love untold
While in Gethsemane.

Israel for seven years under the oppressors
It was because they followed other gods
Refusing to obey the Word of the Lord
But under that oak was Gideon
Mighty man of courage
“The Lord is with you, go in this thy might
Go in this thy might and save Israel!"
But the battle is not for the weak
So let the fearful and shy go home
Let’s blow the trumpets and draw our swords
And draw our swords, the Lord will fight!
When the Holy Spirit came on Gideon
He blew the trumpet
Thirty two thousand gathered after him
Too few for him, too many for the Lord
Three hundred mighty men of courage
Ready for the war
It is to live or die, we cannot lose!
No we cannot lose, the Lord is our strength!

Jesus died on a cross—oh, what awful cost!—
That He might from sin’s blight save us, sinners lost;
Harken, soul, hear Him call, open wide the door,
Taste and see love so free, yours forevermore;
Still He waits patiently, pleading one more time:
Now believe, now receive saving grace sublime.
In this world we will have burdens hard to bear:
Jesus came cares to claim, and our sorrows share;
Weary soul, come to Christ, give Him all your woes—
In Him find peace of mind, rest, relief, repose;
When the waves, tossing wild, seem to speak an end,
There, until “Peace, be still," faithful stands a Friend.
Sinful soul, idle not, time is passing by,
Be not blind, sin will bind tighter and for aye;
Ere thy heart harder grows, won’t you heed the call?
Won’t you choose? Don’t refuse mercy free for all;
Savior sent, still He stands, sacrifice from Heav’n,
Gift so great—do not wait, come and be forgiv’n.
Lord, I come, come to Thee, bringing all my sin,
Thou alone can atone, wash me white within;
Sin’s desires I have fed I do now forsake,
Satan’s hold, though of old, I would ever break;
This I cry, hopeful, and, as I cross the line,
Set my will; Thou fulfill, save and make me Thine.

Do not give up and let go,
Tell the One who saves from all sin.

Give a call to Jesus today,
Ask Him now for help on your way;
He will surely answer you,
And give you help to make it through,
So give a call to Jesus today.
Are you discouraged and sad?
Are there mistakes you must mend?
Would you be happy and glad?
Take the time to talk to a Friend.
Is your day lonely and drear?
Does it seem gloomy and dim?
Jesus is waiting to hear,
Come and bring your troubles to Him.
Has Jesus helped you today?
Do you in victory reign?
Whether at work or at play,
Give a call and thank Him again.
Give a call to Jesus today,
Give Him thanks for help on your way;
Jesus’ smile is shining there,
And there is sunlight everywhere,
Yes, give a call to Jesus today.

Give ear to my prayer Lord, look on me with fairness
You have tried my heart and tested me
I now call upon You, You alone do answer
Hear my prayer Lord, come to me
Wondrously show Your lovingkindness
Keep me as the apple of Your eye
Hide me in the shadow of Your wings
Lord hear my cry
As for me, oh Lord I shall behold Your face in righteousness
I shall be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake
I shall be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake
Wondrously show Your lovingkindness
Keep me as the apple of Your eye
Hide me in the shadow of Your wings
Lord hear my cry, Lord hear my cry
Give ear to my prayer Lord, look on me with fairness
You have tried my heart and tested me
I now call upon You, You alone do answer
Hear my prayer Lord, come to me
Hear my prayer Lord, come to me

Give ear unto God's Holy Word
And hear His perfect law;
Remember what His hand hath done
And tell His works in awe;
Recount unto thy children's hearts
The things which thou wast told—
The truth which thou hast heard and known
From generations old.
So shall thy children hope in God
And not forget forget His name,
But follow in the ways of Him
Who ever is the same.
Recount the works of evil men
Who turned their hearts from God;
Recall the judgment of the Lord,
Behold His chast'ning rod;
Reproach the men of fainting heart
Who fled before the fight;
Acclaim within thy house the men
Who fought for truth and right.
Remember God's almighty hand
To those in deepest need;
His Providential care for those
Who trusted Him indeed.
From rocks there issued healing streams,
The heavens yielded bread—
Make known to all God's wondrous care
Wheree'er His hand hath led.

Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!
What is it in that manger lies?
Who is the Child so young and fair?
The blessed Christ Child lieth there.
My heart for very joy doth leap,
My lips no more can silence keep;
I, too, must sing, with joyful tongue,
That sweetest, dearest cradle song.
Glory to God in highest Heav’n,
Who unto man His Son has giv’n,
While angels sing, our hearts to cheer,
To all the earth a glad new year!

Ev'ry little bird that sings,
Flitting on shining wings,
True and sweet its carol rings,
Gives sweet praise to Jesus.
We will give our Savior praise,
Love and serve Him all our days;
Give Him praise, yes give Him praise,
Give our praise to Jesus.
In the meadows where they grow,
By the streams that gently flow,
God's great love bright blossoms show,
Give sweet praise to Jesus.
We will give our Savior praise,
Love and serve Him all our days;
Give Him praise, yes give Him praise,
Give our praise to Jesus.
Ev'ry insect that we see,
Ev'ry butterfly and bee,
Poised aloft on wing so free,
Gives sweet praise to Jesus.
We will give our Savior praise,
Love and serve Him all our days;
Give Him praise, yes give Him praise,
Give our praise to Jesus.
We are more than bird or bee,
Or the lovely flow'rs we see;
For his goodness now will we,
Give sweet praise to Jesus.
We will give our Savior praise,
Love and serve Him all our days;
Give Him praise, yes give Him praise,
Give our praise to Jesus.

It was down at the feet of Jesus,
O the happy, happy day!
That my soul found peace in believing,
And my sins were washed away.
Let me tell the old, old story
Of His grace so full and free;
For I feel like giving Him the glory
For His wondrous love to me.
It was down at the feet of Jesus,
Where I found such perfect rest,
Where the light first dawned on my spirit,
And my soul was truly blest.
It was down at the feet of Jesus,
Where I brought my guilt and sin,
That he cancelled all my transgressions
And salvation entered in.

People in darkness have seen a great light (lift up your hands)
Behold the Savior's glourious might (rise out from the dead)
We are more than conquerors, a chosen people, His to command
Clothed in righteousnes, cleansed from sin by His wondrous hand
Life up your voice and sing, to Jesus Christ your King
Let the earth and sky show forth His praise
Who sets the captives free, who knows your soul's deep need
Sing to Him, He is the Lord
People in cages of sorrow and pain (He can set free)
This peace He offers who can explain (His gift to me)
My yoke is easy, my burden light, come and find rest (come and find rest)
Let no heart be troubled, fear no evil, seek Jesus instead
Give Him your cloudy day, He'll take your blues away
Don't you carry that weight anymore
No greater joy can be, but Jesus sets you free
Come to Him, He is the Lord
Though we grow weary (He will renew)
You can mount up with wings as an eagle
Nest near His altar (shelter from storm)
Oh my strength, my God, my King
Come to Him, He is the Lord
Come to Him, He is the Lord

Heart, Heart, Heart, ooooooooo
You gotta give Him your heart!
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
All you've got to do is just, just give Jesus your heart
You gotta give Him your heart!
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
I say now all you've got to do is just, just give Jesus your heart
Well, there are many out there who haven't met the Lord
And there are many out there who haven't read His word
And there are many out there who don't know where to start
Just give Jesus your heart.
So give Him your heart!
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
All you've got to do is just, just give Jesus your heart
We must tell them in time so they can know His love
Yes, we must tell them in time of the power from above
We must tell them in time before there is no time
Just give Jesus your heart
The world is evil and is out for itself
The world is caring for nobody else
The world is bogus and it won't understand
The love and heart of the Man
The world needs Jesus or there's no need to live
The world without Him has nothing to give
The world is living in continous night
Let Him give you the light
You gotta give Him your heart!
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
All you've got to do is just give Him your heart
You know that all you've got to do is just, just give Jesus your heart
Just give Jesus your heart!
Just give Jesus your heart!

Give light, O Lord, that we may learn
The way that leads to Thee,
That where our hearts true joy discern,
Our life may be.
Give light, O Lord, that we may know
Thy one unchanging truth,
And follow, all our days below,
Our Guide in youth.
Give light, O Lord, that we may see
Where wisdom bids beware,
And turn our doubting minds to Thee,
In faithful prayer.
Give light, O Lord, that we may look
Beneath, around, above,
And learn from nature’s living book
Thy power and love.
Give light, O Lord, that we may read
All signs that Thou art near,
And, while we live, in word and deed
Thy Name revere.
Give light, O Lord, that we may trace
In trial, pain, and loss
In poorest lot, and lowest place,
A Savior’s cross.
Give light, O Lord, that we may see
A home beyond the sky,
Where all who live in Christ with Thee
Shall never die.

Give me a new, a perfect heart,
From doubt, and fear, and sorrow free;
The mind which was in Christ impart,
And let my spirit cleave to Thee.
O take this heart of stone away!
Thy sway it doth not, cannot own;
In me no longer let it stay;
O take away this heart of stone!
Cause me to walk in Christ my Way;
And I Thy statutes shall fulfill,
In every point Thy law obey,
And perfectly perform Thy will.
Within me Thy good Spirit place,
Spirit of health, and love, and power;
Plant in me Thy victorious grace,
And sin shall never enter more.
O that I now, from sin released,
Thy Word may to the utmost prove!
Enter into the promised rest,
The Canaan of Thy perfect love.
Now let me gain perfection’s height;
Now let me into nothing fall,
Be less than nothing in Thy sight,
And feel that Christ is all in all.

Give me a passion for souls, dear Lord,
A passion to save the lost;
O that Thy love were by all adored,
And welcomed at any cost.
Jesus, I long, I long to be winning
Men who are lost, and constantly sinning;
O may this hour be one of beginning
The story of pardon to tell.
Though there are dangers untold and stern
Confronting me in the way,
Willingly still would I go, nor turn,
But trust Thee for grace each day.
How shall this passion for souls be mine?
Lord, make Thou the answer clear;
Help me to throw out the old life line
To those who are struggling near.

Take the world, but give me Jesus,
All its joys are but a name;
But His love abideth ever,
Through eternal years the same.
Oh, the height and depth of mercy!
Oh, the length and breadth of love!
Oh, the fullness of redemption,
Pledge of endless life above! 
Take the world, but give me Jesus,
Sweetest comfort of my soul;
With my Savior watching o’er me,
I can sing though billows roll.
Take the world, but give me Jesus,
Let me view His constant smile;
Then throughout my pilgrim journey
Light will cheer me all the while.
Take the world, but give me Jesus;
In His cross my trust shall be,
Till, with clearer, brighter vision,
Face to face my Lord I see.

Lord when I am alone
And when I am alone
And when I am alone
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus
In the morning when I rise
In the morning when I rise
In the morning when I rise
Give me Jesus
And when I come to die
And when I come to die
And when I come to die
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world (repeat)
Give me Jesus

I am here a pilgrim stranger,
Give me Jesus alone;
He will guard my soul from danger,
Give me Jesus alone.
Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Till I reach my home in glory
Give me Jesus alone.
When the pow’rs of sin beset me,
Give me Jesus alone;
When my friends on earth forget me,
Give me Jesus alone.
Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Every hour and every moment,
Give me Jesus alone.
Though the world its praise should offer,
Give me Jesus alone;
With my Lord I’ll meekly suffer,
Give me Jesus alone.
Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Let the world deride or flatter,
Give me Jesus alone.
When my heart for joy is singing,
Give me Jesus alone;
Or when pain my heart is wringing,
Give me Jesus alone.
Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
In the sunshine or the shadow,
Give me Jesus alone.
Passing through life’s verdant meadow,
Give me Jesus alone;
Or through death’s dark gloomy shadow,
Give me Jesus alone.
Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Whether life or death await me,
Give me Jesus alone.

Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising,
Give me joy in my heart, I pray;
Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising,
Keep me praising till the break of day.

Keep me serving till the break of day:
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,

Lord, give me light
That I might find my way
Lord, give me light
Guide my footsteps from day to day
If I should falter or lose my way
Lord be my comfort from day to day
And in my time of tribulation
Give me light, give me light, give me light
Oh, yes Lord
Lord, give me light (give me light)
Lord, give me light (give me light)

Give me, O Lord, a heart of grace,
A voice of joy, a shining face,
That I may show, where’er I turn,
Thy love within my soul doth burn.
Though life be sweet and joy be dear,
Be in my mind a quiet fear,
A patient strength in pain and care,
An enmity to dark despair.
A tenderness for all that stray,
With strength to help them on the way,
A cheerfulness, a heav’nly mirth
Brightening my steps along the earth.

Give me, O Lord, right views of Thee,
Thy glorious nature, love, and might;
And draw my spirit’s eyes to see
The things concealed from mortal sight;
And in the soul which Thou hast wrought,
O breathe the understanding thought.
Give me, O Lord, right views of Thee,
And of myself and purpose here;
My life, my end, and destiny,
My secret dreams of hope and fear;
O Thou Who standst behind it all,
To Thee for light I look and call.
Give me, O Lord, right views of truth;
And give me, too, the honest mind,
Which of its freedom gives the proof
In sweet forbearance broad and kind;
Which will not barter, slight, or sell
The truth it sees, but guard it well.
Give me, O Lord, right views of truth;
Thy all discerning Spirit give,
To bring light in earliest youth
Thy living words by which men live;
Of all Thy gifts, I pray, impart
A wise and understanding heart.

Give me oil in my lamp
Keep me burning
Give me oil in my lamp I pray,
Give me oil in my lamp.
Keep me burning, burning, burning
Keep me burning till the break of the day
Sing Hosanna, sing Hosanna,
Sing Hosanna to the King of Kings,
Sing Hosanna, Sing Hosanna,
Sing Hosanna to the King.
.Give me love in my heart, keep me serving
.Give me faith in my heart, keep me trusting

It was an old fashioned Savior of men
Who left His beautiful home in the sky (left His home in glory)
Came to redeem us from bondage of sin
Yes came so freely to suffer and die (what a matchless story)
It was an old fashioned love in His heart
For us that brought to us such pain and loss (when He there was dying)
Joy and salvation He came to impart (to sinners)
There on that old fashioned cross (the old cross)
Lord give me more of the old fashioned way (give me more of the old fashioned 
way)
That I may live and rejoice every day (live rejoicing all of the day)
A love that ever will shine, bring joy to this heart of mine
That I might send forth a cheerful bright ray (a bright ray)
Lord give me more of the old fashioned way (give me more of the old fashioned 
way)
That I may live and rejoice every day (live rejoicing all of the day)
A love that ever will shine, bring joy to this heart of mine
Lord give me more of the old fashioned way (the old way)
It was an old fashioned prayer Jesus prayed
Out in the Garden of Gethsemane (how we ought to love him)
All of our sorrows upon Him were laid
Oh what a wonderful Savior is He (there is none above Him)
It was an old fashioned love so divine
When He said, "Not my will but thine be done" (so willing to suffer)
I am so glad that His pardon is mine (I love Him)
Jesus the crucified One (the blest one)

Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming,
To cheer the wand’rer lone and tempest tossed;
No storm can hide that radiance peaceful beaming,
Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost.
Give me the Bible, holy message shining;
Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way;
Precept and promise, law and love combining,
Till night shall vanish in eternal day.
Give me the Bible, when my heart is broken,
When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear;
Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken,
Hold up faith’s lamp to show my Savior near.
Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten,
Teach me the danger of these realms below;
That lamp of safety o’er the gloom shall brighten,
That light alone the path of peace can show.
Give me the Bible, lamp of life immortal,
Hold up that splendor by the open grave;
Show me the light from Heaven’s shining portal,
Show me the glory gilding Jordan’s wave.

Give me the faith which can remove
And sink the mountain to a plain;
Give me the childlike praying love,
Which longs to build Thy house again;
Thy love, let it my heart overpower,
And all my simple soul devour.
I want an even strong desire,
I want a calmly fervent zeal,
To save poor souls out of the fire,
To snatch them from the verge of hell,
And turn them to a pardoning God,
And quench the brands in Jesus’ blood.
I would the precious time redeem,
And longer live for this alone,
To spend and to be spent for them
Who have not yet my Savior known;
Fully on these my mission prove,
And only breathe, to breathe Thy love.
My talents, gifts, and graces, Lord,
Into Thy blessed hands receive;
And let me live to preach Thy Word,
And let me to Thy glory live;
My every sacred moment spend
In publishing the sinner’s Friend.
Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart
With boundless charity divine,
So shall I all strength exert,
And love them with a zeal like Thine,
And lead them to Thy open side,
The sheep for whom the Shepherd died.

Give me the wings of faith to rise
Within the veil, and see
The saints above, how great their joys,
How bright their glories be.
Once they were mourning here below,
And wet their couch with tears:
They wrestled hard, as we do now,
With sins, and doubts, and fears.
I ask them whence their victory came:
They, with united breath,
Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,
Their triumph to His death.
They marked the footsteps that He trod,
His zeal inspired their breast;
And following their incarnate God,
Possess the promised rest.
Our glorious Leader claims our praise
For His own pattern giv’n;
While the long cloud of witnesses
Show the same path to Heav’n.

“Give Me thy heart," says the Father above—
No gift so precious to Him as our love;
Softly He whispers wherever thou art,
“Gratefully trust Me and give Me thy heart."
“Give Me thy heart, give me thy heart"—
Hear the soft whisper, wherever thou art;
From this dark world He would draw thee apart,
Speaking so tenderly, “Give Me thy heart."
“Give Me thy heart," says the Savior of men,
Calling in mercy again and again;
“Trust in Me only, I’ll never depart—
Have I not died for thee? Give Me thy heart."
“Give Me thy heart," says the Spirit divine;
“All that thou hast to My keeping resign;
Grace more abounding is Mine to impart—
Make full surrender and give Me thy heart."

Give me Thy Spirit, O My God
Then I can well all trails meet,
Deny myself and all my pride,
And wash thy weakest servant's feet.
Give me Thy Spirit, O my God,
Then shall I in thy footsteps trace,
And show to all who read thy word
That I'm indeed renewed by grace.
Give my Thy Spirit, O my God,
Then through my few remaining days
I'll yield obedience to thy word,
And as I go, I'll sing thy praise.

I want you to know, really know
How to live for you Lord
The truth in your book is enough (it's enough, it's enough)
But what do we find
When our heart is confined
To a rule that our mind's made up? 
Can I see, truly see
In this dark-filled world
Your love that shines light everyday?
When our hearts become blind
Because we close our eyes to your way 
Give me you (no other comforts)
No other comforts can fill me like you do
I'm tired of emotion (I'm tired) from shallow devotion
All I'm asking now is give me you (all I want is you) 
Sometimes, many times
It's a lonely road
To raise a Godly family on my own
But I'm praying in time
That my husband will find
The love that you, Lord, have shown 
For the storms, they come with no warning
(And you are) Hiding your face from me
In the midst of my fall
Your great love shines through it all 
All I really need (all I really need) is you (give me you)

She labored so hard in this world below
She didn't have things that most mothers know
Raising her children on a widow's small pay
Washing and ironing since dad passed away.
I want to go to Heaven when this life is o'er
I want to be with Jesus on eternity's shore
But If I've a crown coming when rewards go around
Please, blessed Jesus give mother my crown.
I didn't realize it when I was a lad
Just how great a burden my mother had
Adoption was offered but momma said no
She raised us and taught us the right way to go.

Give of your best to the Master;
Give of the strength of your youth.
Throw your soul’s fresh, glowing ardor
Into the battle for truth.
Jesus has set the example,
Dauntless was He, young and brave.
Give Him your loyal devotion;
Give Him the best that you have.
Give of your best to the Master;
Give of the strength of your youth.
Clad in salvation’s full armor,
Join in the battle for truth.
Give of your best to the Master;
Give Him first place in your heart.
Give Him first place in your service;
Consecrate every part.
Give, and to you will be given;
God His beloved Son gave.
Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
Give Him the best that you have.
Give of your best to the Master;
Naught else is worthy His love.
He gave Himself for your ransom,
Gave up His glory above.
Laid down His life without murmur,
You from sin’s ruin to save.
Give Him your heart’s adoration;
Give Him the best that you have.

Give peace in these our days, O Lord,
Great dangers are now at hand;
Thine enemies with one accord
Christ’s Name in every land
Seek to deface, root out and rase,
Thy true right worship indeed.
Be Thou the Stay, O Lord, we Thee pray.
Thou helpest alone in all need.
Give us that peace that we do lack,
Through misbelief, and in ill life.
Thy Word to offer Thou dost not slack,
Which we unkindly gainstrive.
With fire and sword, this healthful Word
Some persecute and oppress.
Some with the mouth confess the truth
Without sincere godliness.
Give peace and us Thy sprite down send
With grief and repentance true;
Do piece our hearts our lives to amend,
And by faith Christ renew;
That fear and dread, war and bloodshed,
Through Thy sweet mercy and grace,
May from us slide, Thy truth abide,
And shine in every place.

Give rest, O Christ, to thy servant with thy saints:
where sorrow and pain are no more;
neither sighing but life everlasting.
Thou only art immortal, the creator and maker of man:
and we are mortal formed from the dust of the earth,
and unto earth shall we return:
for so thou didst ordain,
when thou created me saying:
"Dust thou art und unto dust shalt thou return."
All we go down to the dust;
and weeping o'er the grave we make our song:
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

His mercy ever is the same.
Let Aaron’s house now praise Jehovah;
The Lord is good, O praise His Name:

In a large place the Lord hath set me;
In my distress He heard my cry.
I will not fear, the Lord is with me;
What can man do, when God is nigh?
The Lord is chief among my helpers;
And I shall see my foes o’erthrown:
Far better than in man or princes,
My trust I place in God alone.
I shall not die, but live, declaring
The works of God, Who tried me sore,
And chastened me; but in His mercy
Not unto death has giv’n me o’er.
The gates of righteousness set open,
The gate of God! I’ll enter in
To praise Thee, Lord, Who prayer hast answered,
And savedst me from all my sin.
The stone—O Lord, it is Thy doing—
The stone the builders did despise,
Is made the headstone of the corner,
And it is marv’lous in our eyes.

The Lord has made; we’ll joy and sing.
Send now prosperity, we pray Thee;
And, O our God, salvation bring!

Are you giving to the world a smile (sunny smile)
Helping lessen someone's dreary mile (dreary mile)
Do you greet the world with song as through life you pass along
Cheering those you may meet along life's way
Give the world a smile each day (give the world a bright smile every day)
Helping someone on life's way (helping someone on life's dreary way)
From the paths of sin (paths of sin) oh bring the wonderer's in (bring them in)
To the master's fold to stay (to His fold, His forever to stay)
Help to cheer the lone and sad (help cheer the sad, the lonely and sad)
Help to make some pilgrim glad (help make pilgrim, make somebody glad)
Let your life so be that (life so be that) all the world might see
The joy of serving Jesus with a smile (a bright sunny smile)
Give the world a happy song today (song today)
That will help some pilgrim on His way (on His way)
You can tell him of the Lord and His heavenly reward
If you'll only follow Jesus day by day

Are you tired of chasing pretty rainbows?
Are you tired of spinning round and round?
Wrap up all those shattered dreams of your life
And at the feet of Jesus, lay them down.
Give them all, give them all, give them all to Jesus
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts, and broken toys.
Give them all, give them all, give them all to Jesus
And He will turn your sorrows into joy.
He never said you only see sunshine,
He never said there would be no rain.
He only promised a heart full of singing
About the very thing that once brought pain.
Give them all, give them all, give them all to Jesus
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts, and broken toys.
Give them all, give them all, give them all to Jesus
And He will turn your sorrows into joy.

Give to our God immortal praise;
Mercy and truth are all His ways:
Wonders of grace to God belong,
Give to the Lord of lords renown,
The King of kings with glory crown:
His mercies ever shall endure,
When lords and kings are known no more.
He built the earth, He spread the sky,
And fixed the starry lights on high:
Wonders of grace to God belong,
He fills the sun with morning light;
He bids the moon direct the night:
His mercies ever shall endure,
When suns and moons shall shine no more.
The Jews He freed from Pharaoh’s hand,
And brought them to the promised land
Wonders of grace to God belong,
He saw the Gentiles dead in sin,
And felt His pity work within
His mercies ever shall endure,
When death and sin shall reign no more.
He sent His Son with power to save
From guilt, and darkness, and the grave
Wonders of grace to God belong,
Through this vain world He guides our feet,
And leads us to His heav’nly seat
His mercies ever shall endure,
When this vain world shall be no more.

Give to the winds thy fears,
Hope and be undismayed.
God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears,
God shall lift up thy head.
Through waves and clouds and storms,
He gently clears thy way;
Wait thou His time; so shall this night
Soon end in joyous day.
Still heavy is thy heart?
Still sinks thy spirit down?
Cast off the world, let fear depart
Bid every care begone.
What though Thou rulest not;
Yet heaven, and earth, and hell
Proclaim, God sitteth on the throne,
And ruleth all things well.
And whatsoe’er Thou will’st,
Thou dost, O King of kings;
What Thine unerring wisdom chose,
Thy power to being brings.
Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command;
So shalt thou, wondering, own that way,
How wise, how strong this hand.
Far, far above thy thought,
His counsel shall appear,
When fully He the work hath wrought,
That caused thy needless fear.
Thou seest our weakness, Lord;
Our hearts are known to Thee;
O lift Thou up the sinking hand,
Confirm the feeble knee!
Let us in life, in death,
Thy steadfast truth declare,
And publish with our latest breath
Thy love and guardian care.

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees
O Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes from evil things
O Lord we cast down our idols
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks your face O God of Jacob
O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks your face O God of Jacob
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another

This is my desire
To honour You
Lord, with all my heart
I worship You
All I have within me
I give You praise
All that I adore
Is in You
Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul
I live for You alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

Giver of the perfect gift,
only hope of human race,
hear the prayer our hearts uplift
trembling at thy throne of grace.
Though the accusing voice within
speaks of many a wrong to thee,
thou canst cleanse from every sin,
thou canst set the conscience free.
Who can save us, Lord, but thou?
Let thy mercy show thy power;
lo, we plead thy promise now,
now, in this accepted hour.
Oh! may these our lenten days,
blessed by thee, with thee be passed,
that with purer, nobler praise
we may keep thy feast at last.
God the Holy Trinity,
grant the mercy we implore;
God the One, all praise to thee
through the ages evermore.

(Giving me joy) More than I've ever dreamed
(Oh what joy) Oh what joy you know that I've been redeemed
I want to thank You for giving Your Son
And I know in Jesus the victory is won 
When life is up it's so easy to wear a smile
Then troubles come will you wear a frown?
Temptations round you, what will you do?
Jesus is able to see you through 
The suffering Savior He's made a way
We can have joy in Him everyday
If we will only trust and believe
He'll give joy more than we've ever dreamed 
Giving me joy
(Oh what joy) Oh what joy you know that I've been redeemed
I want to thank You for giving Your Son
And I know in Jesus the victory is won 
Bridge
(He is able) He is able, (He is King of Kings) He is the King
(He is omnipotent) I know that my God can do anything (He can do anything) 
Bridge
He is able, He is King of Kings
He is omnipotent, He can do anything 
He is able 

I'm gonna stop kicking my self around
Swimming in a pool of pity
I'm gonna pick myself up off the ground
And get back to the nitty gritty
It's just one step, two step
And then I'm back on my way (on my way)
Sittin' around has just been getting me down
And that's why I just have to say
That I'm giving up, giving up
I'll never give up again (giving up, giving up now)
I'm giving up, giving up
And hanging on 'til the end (giving up, giving up)
I'm gonna keep working with what I've got
Wait until the clouds start breaking
Instead of sitting and wishing for a better lot
Than the one already in the making
It's just one step, two step
And strength enough for today (for today)
Working it out instead of fretting about
It's gonna help to keep me on my way
Lord,
When it gets to hard to take it and I don't think I can make it any longer
That's when I decide that I'm gonna take another stride and ask the Lord to give 
me strength to hold on
Whoa.
Giving on up (giving up, giving on up)
I'll never give up again (giving up, giving up now)
I said I'm giving up (giving up, giving on up)
(giving up, giving up)
Well, I'm giving up, I'm giving up (giving up, giving on up)
I'm giving up (giving up, giving up now)
Well, I know that it sounds so simple (giving up, giving on up)
But it's up to me (giving up, giving up)
(giving up, giving on up)
(I'm giving up, giving up now)
Well, I know when it's through (giving up, giving on up)
Your going to see me through it again (giving up, giving up)
I'm gonna pick myself up (giving up, giving on up)
(I'm giving up, giving up now)
Giving up, giving up (giving up, giving on up) (fade)

Glad Christmas bells, your music tells
The sweet and pleasant story;
How came to earth, in lowly birth,
The Lord of life and glory.
No palace hall its ceiling tall
His kingly head spread over,
There only stood a stable rude
The heavenly Babe to cover.
No raiment gay, as there He lay,
Adorned the infant Stranger;
Poor, humble Child of mother mild,
She laid Him in a manger.
But from afar, a splendid star
The wise men westward turning;
The livelong night saw pure and bright,
Above His birth place burning

Glad music fills the Christmas sky
a hymn of praise, a song of love;
the angels worship high above
and Mary sings her lullaby.
Of tender love for God she sings,
the chosen mother of the Son;
she knows that wonders have begun,
and trusts for all the future brings.
The angel of the skies
who come to tell us of God's grace
have yet to know his human face,
to watch him die, to see him rise.
Let praise be true and love sincere,
rejoice to greet the Savior's birth;
let peace and honor fill the earth
and mercy reign for God is here!
Then lift your hearts and voices high,
sing once again the Christmas song:
for love and praise to Christ belong
in shouts of joy, and lullaby.

There will be a happy meeting in heaven I know
When we see the many loved ones we've known here below
Gather on the blessed hilltops with hearts all aglow
That will be a glad reunion day
Glad day (that will be a happy day yes), a wonderful day
Glad day (that will be a happy day yes), a glorious day
There with all the holy angels and loved ones to stay
That will be a glad reunion day
When we live a million years in that wonderful place
Basking in the love of Jesus beholding His face
It will seem but just a moment of praising His grace
That will be a glad reunion day

Glad tidings! glad tidings! O wonderful love!
A message has come from our Father above;
’Tis Jesus who brought it to young and to old,
A message of mercy more precious than gold.
Glad tidings, glad tidings!
O wonderful, wonderful, wonderful love!
Glad tidings, glad tidings!
We hail the glad tidings of wonderful love.
He saith to the weary, O come unto Me;
The poor and the lowly His glory may see;
He blesseth the meek with His soul-cheering voice;
He comforts the mourners and bids them rejoice.
How happy are they who believe in the Lord,
And love the sweet counsel they find in His Word!
Be ready to hear, and be swift to obey,
And follow His steps in the bright shining way.

The Lord is our Shepherd, precious Friend and Guide,
We'll trust Him ever, trust Him ever, walking by His side;
Be this our endeavor faithfully to show,
Where Jesus leads our willing feet beside Him still shall go.
We'll go, we'll go, we'll gladly, gladly go,
Though skies are dark and chilly winds may blow,
The lost to find, or bravely meet the foe,
Wherever Jesus calls us we'll gladly, gladly go.
Through sunshine or tempest, over land or sea,
Whate弾r befalls us, where He calls us, quickly we would be;
The toils that await us though we cannot know,
At His command with heart and hand beside Him we will go.
The Lord is our Keeper, watching ever near,
In Him confiding, firm abiding, wherefore should we fear?
We'll cling to the promise left us here below,
And wheresoe弾r He leadeth us beside Him we will go.

The golden morning is fast approaching;
Jesus soon will come
To take His faithful and happy children
To their promised home.
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
Piercing through this night of gloom!
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
That will burst the tomb.
The Gospel summons will soon be carried
To the nations round;
The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry
And the trumpet sound.
Attended by all the shining angels,
Down the flaming sky
The Judge will come, and will take His people
Where they will not die.
There those loved ones who have long been parted
Will all meet that day;
The tears of those who are brokenhearted
Will be wiped away.

The Bible says Jesus loved children
In Galilee, long ago;
And tho' He today is in heaven,
He loves us the same, we know.
Gleaners, gleaners,
Ready, and willing, and true,
We follow the army of reapers,
And something we find to do.
These two little hands may be feeble,
These little feet often fall,
Yet these little hearts can be loyal,
And that is the best of all.
Gleaners, gleaners,
Ready, and willing, and true,
We follow the army of reapers,
And something we find to do.
We may not be able to carry
The burden he gives to you,
Yet all that we can do for Jesus,
We'll faithfully, bravely do.
Gleaners, gleaners,
Ready, and willing, and true,
We follow the army of reapers,
And something we find to do.

Gliding o’er life’s fitful waters,
Heavy surges sometimes roll;
And we sigh for yonder haven,
For the homeland of the soul.
Blessed homeland, ever fair!
Sin can never enter there;
But the soul, to life awaking,
Everlasting bloom shall wear.
Oft we catch a faint reflection,
Of its bright and vernal hills;
And, though distant, how we hail it!
How each heart with rapture thrills!
To our Father, and our Savior,
To the Spirit, Three in One,
We shall sing glad songs of triumph
When our harvest work is done.
’Tis the weary pilgrim’s homeland,
Where each throbbing care shall cease,
And our longings and our yearnings,
Like a wave, be hushed to peace.

Father, we love You
We worship and adore You
Glorify Thy Name in all the earth
Glorify Thy Name
Glorify Thy Name
Glorify Thy Name in all the earth
Jesus, we love You
We worship and adore You
Glorify Thy Name in all the earth
Spirit, we love You
We worship and adore You
Glorify Thy Name in all the earth

Glorious, beauteous, golden-bright,
Shedding softest, purest light,
Shone the stars that Christmas night,
When the Jewish shepherds kept
Watch beside their flocks that slept.
But the stars’ sweet golden gleam
Faded quickly as a dream
’Mid the wondrous glory-stream
That illumined all the earth,
When Christ’s angels sang His birth.
Soft and pure and holy glory,
Kings and seers and prophets hoary,
Shed throughout the sacred story:
While the priests, like shepherds true,
Watched beside God’s chosen few.
But that light no more availéd,
And its splendor staighway paléd
In His light Whom angels hailéd;
Even as the stars of old,
’Mid the brightness lost their gold.
Now no more on Christmas night,
Is the sky with angels bright,
But for ever shines the Light;
Even He Whose birth they told
To the shepherds by the fold.
Since that Light then darkens never,
Let us all, with glad endeavor,
Sing the song that echoes ever:
Glory in the highest Heaven!
Peace on earth to us forgiven.

Once I was bound by sin’s galling fetters;
Chained like a slave, I struggled in vain.
But I received a glorious freedom,
When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.
Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom!
No more in chains of sin I repine!
Jesus the glorious Emancipator—
Now and forever He shall be mine.
Freedom from all the carnal affections;
Freedom from envy, hatred and strife;
Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions;
Freedom from all that saddened my life!
Freedom from pride and all sinful follies;
Freedom from love and glitter of gold;
Freedom from evil temper and anger;
Glorious freedom, rapture untold!
Freedom from fear with all of its torments;
Freedom from care with all of its pain;
Freedom in Christ, my blessed Redeemer—
He Who has rent my fetters in twain.

Glorious God, accept a heart
That pants to sing Thy praise!
Thou without beginning art,
And without end of days:
Thou, a Spirit invisible,
Dost to none Thy fullness show;
None Thy majesty can tell,
Or all Thy Godhead know.
All Thine attributes we own,
Thy wisdom, power, and might;
Happy in Thyself alone,
In goodness infinite,
Thou Thy goodness hast displayed,
On Thine every work impressed;
Lov’st whate’er Thy hands have made,
But man Thou lov’st the best.
Willing Thou that all should know
Thy saving truth, and live,
Dost to each, or bliss or woe,
With strictest justice give:
Thou with perfect righteousness
Renderest every man his due;
Faithful in Thy promises,
And in Thy threatenings, too.
Thou art merciful to all
Who truly turn to Thee;
Hear me then for pardon call,
And show Thy grace to me;
Me, through mercy reconciled,
Me, for Jesus’ sake forgiv’n,
Me receive, Thy favored child
To sing Thy praise in Heav’n.

Glorious is Thy name, Most Holy, God and Father of us all
We Thy servants bow before Thee, Strive to answer ev'ry call
Thou with life's great good hast blest us, Cared for us from earliest years
Unto Thee our thanks we render; Thy deep love o'ercomes all fears
For our world of need and anguish we would lift to Thee our prayer
Faithful stewards of Thy bounty, May we with our brothers share
In the name of Christ our Savior, Who redeems and sets us free
Gifts we bring of heart and treasure, That our lives may worthier be
In the midst of time we journey, From Thy hand comes each new day
We would use it in Thy service, Humbly wisely while we may
So to Thee, Lord and Creator, Praise and Honor we accord
Thine the earth and Thine the heavens, Tho' all the Eternal Word.

Glorious is Thy Name, O Lord!
Heav’n and earth with one accord
Tell Thy greatness, part revealed,
But the larger part concealed.
How shall we poor singers dare
Seek Thy face in praise and prayer?
Fearful is Thy Name, O Lord!
Dread Thy voice and sharp Thy sword;
Thunders roll around Thy path;
None can stand before Thy wrath!
How shall trembling sinners dare
Lift their voice in praise and prayer?
Yet with all Thy wondrous might
Far beyond our mortal sight,
Perfect wisdom, boundless powers,
Thou, O glorious God! art ours.
So, though filled with awe, we dare
Name Thy Name in praise and prayer.
Since, to save a world undone,
Thou didst give Thine only Son,
All Thy greatness, Lord Most High,
Brings Thee to our hearts more nigh.
Thus in faith and hope we dare
Claim Thy love in praise and prayer.

Glorious Majesty, before Thee
We bow to worship and adore Thee;
With grateful hearts to Thee we sing,
Earth and heaven tell the story
Of Thine eternal might and glory,
And all Thy works their incense bring.
Lo, hosts of cherubim and countless seraphim
Sing hosanna, holy is God
Almighty God, all merciful and all wise God!
God of light, exalted, holy!
Thy tender care protects the lowly,
Nor leaves Thy children to their fate.
Gracious art Thou, God our Father,
Thy chosen people Thou dost gather,
Within Thine arms compassionate,
Thou gavest us Thy Son, through whom Thy grace is won,
And Thy Spirit dwelleth within to cleanse from sin
Whom Thine own Son hath died to win.
Bless and keep, O Lord, Thy creatures,
Reveal to us Thy gracious features,
O turn to us Thy face with peace
Here our songs we humbly tender,
Til glorified our tongues shall render
To Thee our praise without surcease,
Where hosts of cherubim and countless seraphim
Sing holy is God, almighty God,
All merciful and all wise God!

I came defiled and guilty
To Jesus the mighty to save;
He took my sins and sorrows,
And beauty for ashes gave.
Peace, peace, glorious peace,
Like tranquil waters flow;
Streaming down over my heart,
Made white as the driven snow.
I came to Jesus repenting,
Confessing my every sin,
My heart’s door swung wide open,
And glorious peace flowed in.
And since that joyful moment
Of glorious peace to me,
My soul has ceased its pining,
My heart has been light and free.
Roll on, ye changing seasons,
Or turbulent seas of sin;
I’ve found a blessed shelter,
And glorious peace within.

Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God!
He, Whose Word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode.
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation’s walls surrounded,
Thou may’st smile at all thy foes.
See! the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love;
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove:
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst t’assuage?
Grace, which like the Lord, the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.
Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear!
For a glory and a cov’ring
Showing that the Lord is near.
Thus deriving from our banner
Light by night and shade by day;
Safe they feed upon the manna
Which He gives them when they pray.
Blest inhabitants of Zion,
Washed in the Redeemer’s blood!
Jesus, Whom their souls rely on,
Makes them kings and priests to God.
’Tis His love His people raises,
Over self to reign as kings,
And as priests, His solemn praises
Each for a thank offering brings.
Savior, if of Zion’s city,
I through grace a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in Thy Name.
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion’s children know.

Glorious Yuletide, glad bells proclaim it,
Children extol its joys in jubilant throng.
Come, all ye people, join in our gladness,
Loud ring our praises in sacred song.
Onward to Bethlehem, follow the shepherds,
Gather around the lowly manger and stall.
Join with the angels, welcome the Savior
Born in the flesh to be Lord of all.
Onward to Bethlehem, follow the wise men,
Come from afar with their gifts and homage to bring.
Sweeter than incense, prized more than jewels,
Hearts true and loyal unto the King!

Glorious things are spoken of thee,
Thou city of God, thou home of the free;
Fair as the morning, clear as the sun,
Great army with banners, conquering one.
Zion of God, thou home of the free,
Washed in the blood, I’m dwelling in thee;
Glorious home, oh, gather us there,
Church of the Firstborn, thou art so fair.
Glorious things I cannot declare
Are found in thy courts so wondrously fair;
Those who remain within thee shall rest,
O Zion of God, thou home of the blest.
Glorious things shine forth in thy light,
Thou city so fair, no sorrow can blight;
Blessings so rich, unnumbered, untold,
More precious are they than diamonds and gold.
Glorious things divinely complete
Within thee are found—thy love is replete;
Down through the ages, spotless and pure,
Thy God hath preserved thee, thou art secure.

When I’m there with You in heaven
What a wondrous joy will be
Gathered with the angel 
Standing by the glassy sea
Such a thought is hard to fathom
In the presence of my King
And with countless ones forgiven
Gathered round the throne to sing
Glory and honor, worthy is the Lamb (worthy is the Lamb)
Glory and honor, worthy is the Lamb (worthy is the Lamb)
Mortal words cannot express it
All the ways You reign supreme
Even death can’t hold the vastness
Nor approach this awesome theme
You are God and to Your glory
We will worship and abide
In Your presence there forever
We’ll be happy to reside
Ooh.(worthy is the Lamb)
Worthy is the Lamb (worthy is the Lamb), worthy is the Lamb

Glory be to God on high, Alleluia!
Let the whole creation cry, Alleluia!
Peace and blessing He has given, Alleluia!
Earth 
Creatures of the field and flood, Alleluia!
Earth and sea cry “God is good," Alleluia!
Toiling pilgrims raise the song, Alleluia!
Saints in light the strain prolong, Alleluia!
Stars that have no voice to sing Alleluia!
Give their glory to our King, Alleluia!
Silent powers and angels’ song, Alleluia!
All unto our God belong, Alleluia!

Glory be to God on high,
And peace on earth descend;
Now God comes down, He bows the sky,
And shows Himself our Friend!
God the invisible appears,
God the Blest, the Great I AM,
He sojourns in this vale of tears,
And Jesus is His Name.
Him by the angels all adored,
Their Maker and their King;
Lo, tidings of their humbled Lord
They now to mortals bring;
Emptied of His majesty,
Of His dazzling glories shorn,
Our being’s Source begins to be,
And God Himself is born!
See the eternal Son of God
A mortal Son of Man,
Now dwelling in an earthly clod
Whom Heaven cannot contain!
Stand amazed, ye heavens, look at this!
See the Lord of earth and skies
Low humbled to the dust He is,
And in a manger lies!
So do the sons of men rejoice
The Prince of Peace proclaim,
With Heaven’s host lift up our voice,
And shout Immanuel’s Name;
Our knees and hearts to Him we bow;
Of our flesh, and of our bone,
See—Jesus is our Brother now,
And God is all our own!

Glory be to God on high,
God Whose glory fills the skies;
Peace on earth to man forgiv’n,
Man, the well beloved of Heav’n.
Sovereign Father, heavenly King,
Thee we now presume to sing;
Glad, Thine attributes confess,
Glorious all, and numberless.
Hail, by all Thy works adored!
Hail, the everlasting Lord!
Thee with thankful hearts we prove
God of power, and God of love.
Christ our Lord and God we own,
Christ, the Father’s only Son,
Lamb of God for sinners slain,
Savior of offending man.
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,
Hear, the world’s atonement, Thou!
Jesus, in Thy Name we pray,
Take, O take our sins away!
Powerful Advocate with God,
Justify us by Thy blood;
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,
Hear, the world’s atonement, Thou!
Hear, for Thou, O Christ, alone
Art with God the Father One,
One the Holy Ghost with Thee,
One supreme, eternal Three.

Glory be to God the Father,
Glory be to God the Son,
Glory be to God the Spirit—
Great Jehovah, Three in One!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
While eternal ages run!
Glory be to Him who loved us,
Washed us from each spot and stain!
Glory be to Him who bought us,
Made us kings with Him to reign!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
To the Lamb that once was slain!
Glory to the King of angels,
Glory to the Church's King,
Glory to the King of nations!
Heaven and earth, your praises bring;
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
To the King of Glory bring!
"Glory, blessing, praise eternal!"
Thus the choir of angels sings;
"Honor, riches, power, dominion!"
Thus its praise creation brings.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Glory to the King of kings.

Glory be to Him Who loved us,
Washed us from each sinful stain;
Glory be to Him Who made us
Priests and kings with Him to reign;
Glory, worship, laud and blessing
To the Lamb Who once was slain.
“Glory, worship, laud and blessing,"
Thus the choir triumphant sings;
“Honor, riches, pow’r, dominion,"
Thus its praise creation brings;
Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Lord of Lords, and King of kings.
Glory to the King of angels,
Glory to the Church’s King,
Glory to the King of nations,
Heav’n and earth His praises sing:
Glory ever and for ever
To the King of Glory bring.
Glory be to Thee, O Father,
Glory be to Thee, O Son,
Glory be to Thee, O Spirit,
Glory be to God alone,
As it was, is now, and shall be
While the endless ages run.

Glory be to Jesus,
Who, in bitter pains,
Poured for me the lifeblood
From His sacred veins!
Grace and life eternal
In that blood I find;
Blest be His compassion,
Infinitely kind.
Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream
Which from endless torments
Doth the world redeem.
Abel’s blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.
Oft as it is sprinkled
On our guilty hearts,
Satan in confusion
Terror struck departs.
Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel hosts, rejoicing,
Make their glad reply.
Lift we then our voices,
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious blood!

Glory ever be to Jesus,
God’s own well beloved Son;
By His grace He hath redeemed us,
“It is finished," all is done.
Saved by grace through faith in Jesus,
Saved by His own precious blood,
May we in His love abiding,
Follow on to know the Lord.
Oh the weary days of wand’ring,
Longing, hoping for the light;
These at last all lie behind us,
Jesus is our strength and might.
In His safe and holy keeping,
’Neath the shadow of His wing,
Gladly in His love confiding,
May our souls His praises sing.

A glory gilds the sacred page,
Majestic like the sun;
It gives a light to every age;
It gives, but borrows none.
The Spirit breathes upon the Word
And brings the truth to sight;
Precepts and promises afford
A sanctifying light.
The hand that gave it still supplies
The gracious light and heat;
His truths upon the nations rise;
They rise, but never set.
Let everlasting thanks be Thine
For such a bright display.
As makes a world of darkness shine
With beams of heavenly day.
My soul rejoices to pursue
The steps of Him I love,
Till glory breaks upon my view
In brighter worlds above.

Around the throne of God in heav'n
Thousands of children stand,
Children whose sins are all forgiv'n,
A holy, happy band:
Singing, "Glory, glory, glory!"
Singing, "Glory, glory, glory!"
In flowing robes of spotless white
See ev'ry one arrayed,
Dwelling in everlasting light
And joys that never fade:
What brought them to that world above,
That heav'n so bright and fair,
Where all is peace, and joy, and love?
How came those children there?
Because the Saviour shed His blood
To wash away their sin;
Bathed in that pure and precious flood,
Behold them white and clean!
On earth they sought the Saviour's grace,
On earth they loved His Name;
So now they see His blessed face,
And stand before the Lamb: 

Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name 
Make known among the nations what he has done 
Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name 
Make known among the nations what he has done 
Sing to him sing praise to him 
Tell of all his wonderful acts 
Glory in his holy name 
Glory in his holy name 
Glory in his name 
Glory in his name 
Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name 
Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice 
Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name 
Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice 
Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name 
Make known among the nations what he has done 
Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name 
Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice 
Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name 
Glory in his holy name 

Glory in highest heaven
to our exalted Saviour,
who left behind
for all mankind
these tokens of his favour:
his bleeding love and mercy,
his all-redeeming passion;
who here displays,
and gives the grace
which brings us our salvation.
Louder than gathered waters,
or bursting peals of thunder,
we lift our voice
and speak our joys,
and shout our loving wonder.
Shout, all our elder brethren,
while we record the story
of him that came
and suffered shame,
to carry us to glory.
Angels in fixed amazement
around our altars hover,
with eager gaze
adore the grace
of our eternal Lover,
himself and all his fulness
who gives to the believer;
and by this bread
whoe'er are fed
shall live with God for ever.

I'm in the way, the bright and shining way
I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way)
Telling the world that Jesus saves today
Yes, I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way)
I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way)
I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way)
Heaven is nearer and the way groweth clearer
For I'm in the gloryland way! (gloryland way)
Onward I go rejoicing in His love
I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way)
Soon I shall see Him in that home above
Oh, I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way)

Glory, love, and praise, and honor
for our food 
now bestowed
render we the Donor.
Bounteous God, we now confess thee:
God who thus
blessest us,
meet it is to bless thee.
Thankful for our every blessing,
let us sing
Christ the Spring,
never, never ceasing.
Source of all our gifts and graces,
Christ we own;
Christ alone
calls for all our praises.
He dispels our sin and sadness,
life imparts,
cheers our hearts,
fills with food and gladness.
Who himself for all has given,
us he feeds,
us he leads
to a feast in heaven.

The glory of the spring how sweet!
The new-born life how glad!
What joy the happy earth to greet
In new, bright raiment clad!
Divine Redeemer, Thee I bless;
I greet Thy going forth;
I love Thee in the loveliness
Of Thy renewed earth.
But O these wonders of Thy grace,
These nobler works of Thine,
These marvels sweeter far to trace,
These new births more divine:
This new-born glow of faith so strong,
This bloom of love so fair,
This new-born ecstasy of song,
And fragrancy of prayer!
Creator Spirit, work in me
These wonders sweet of Thine;
Divine Redeemer, graciously
Renew this heart of mine.
Still let new life and strength upspring,
Still let new joy be given;
And grant the glad new song to ring
Through the new earth and Heaven.

The glory of these forty days
We celebrate with songs of praise;
For Christ, by Whom all things were made,
Himself has fasted and has prayed.
Alone and fasting Moses saw
The loving God Who gave the law;
And to Elijah, fasting, came
The steeds and chariots of flame.
So Daniel trained his mystic sight,
Delivered from the lions’ might;
And John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became
The herald of Messiah’s Name.
Then grant us, Lord, like them to be
Full oft in fast and prayer with Thee;
Our spirits strengthen with Thy grace,
And give us joy to see Thy face.
O Father, Son, and Spirit blest,
To thee be every prayer addressed,
Who art in threefold Name adored,
From age to age, the only Lord.

Glory to God in the highest!
Glory to God! Glory to God!
Glory to God in the highest!
Shall be our song today;
Another year’s rich mercies prove
His ceaseless care and boundless love;
So let our loudest voices raise
Our glad and grateful song of praise.
Glory to God in the highest!
Glory to God in the highest!
Glory, glory, glory, glory,
Glory be to God on high!
Glory, glory, glory, glory,
Glory be to God on high!
Glory to God in the highest!
Glory to God! Glory to God!
Glory to God in the highest!
Shall be our song today;
O, may we, an unbroken band,
Around the throne of Jesus stand,
And there with angels and the throng
Of His redeemed ones, join the song.

Glory to God on high,
Let praises fill the sky!
Praise ye His Name.
Angels His Name adore,
Who all our sorrows bore,
And saints cry evermore,
“Worthy the Lamb!"
All they around the throne
Cheerfully join in one,
Praising His Name.
We who have felt His blood,
Sealing our peace with God,
Spread His dear Name abroad—
“Worthy the Lamb!"
To Him our hearts we raise—
None else shall have our praise;
Praise ye His Name.
Him our exalted Lord,
By us below adored,
We praise with one accord—
“Worthy the Lamb!"
If we should hold our peace,
Stones would cry out apace;
Praise ye His Name!
Love does our souls inspire,
With heav’nly, pure desire,
And sets us all on fire—
“Worthy the Lamb!"
Join all the human race,
Our Lord and God to bless;
Praise ye His Name!
In Him we will rejoice,
Making a cheerful noise,
And say with heart and voice,
“Worthy the Lamb!"
Though we must change our place,
Our souls shall never cease
Praising His Name;
To Him we’ll tribute bring,
Laud Him, our gracious King,
And without ceasing sing,
“Worthy the Lamb!"

“For God so loved!" Oh, wondrous theme!
Oh! wondrous key to wondrous scheme!
A Savior sent to sinful men—
Glory to God the Father!
Glory to God the Father!
Glory to God the Father!
Glory, glory, glory to God the Father!
In love God gave, in love Christ came,
That man might know the Father’s Name,
And in the Son salvation claim—
Glory to God the Father!
As man He tarried here below,
The pow’r and love of God to show;
To help and heal all human woe—
Glory to God the Father!
Upon the cross His life He gave,
His people from their sins to save;
For them descended to the grave—
Glory to God the Father!
By God exalted from the dead,
He reigns on high, the living Head
Of every soul for whom He bled—
Glory to God the Father!

GLORY to God, whose sovereign grace
Hath animated senseless stones;
Called us to stand before his face,
And raised us into Abraham's sons! 
The people that in darkness lay,
In sin and error's deadly shade,
Have seen a glorious gospel day,
In Jesu's lovely face displayed.
Thou only, Lord, the work hast done,
And bared thine arm in all our sight;
Hast made the reprobates thine own,
And claimed the outcasts as thy right.
Thy single arm, almighty Lord,
To us the great salvation brought,
Thy Word, thy all-creating Word,
That spake at first the world from nought.
For this the saints lift up their voice,
And ceaseless praise to thee is given;
For this the hosts above rejoice,
We raise the happiness of heaven.
For this, no longer sons of night,
To thee our thankful hearts we give;
To thee, who call'dst us into light,
To thee we die, to thee we live.
Suffice that for the season past
Hell's horrid language filled our tongues,
We all thy words behind us cast,
And lewdly sang the drunkard's songs.
But, O the power of grace divine!
In hymns we now our voices raise,
Loudly in strange hosannas join,
And blasphemies are turned to praise!

Glory to God! The morn appointed breaks,
And earth awakes from all the woeful past;
For, with the morn, the Lord of life awakes,
And sin and death into the grave are cast.
Glory to God! The cross, with all its shame,
Now sheds its glory o’er a ransomed world;
For He Who bore the burden of our blame,
With pierced hands the foe to hell hath hurled.
Glory to God! Sing, ransomed souls again,
And let your songs our glorious Victor laud,
Who by His might hath snapped the tyrant’s chain,
And set us free to rise with Him to God.
Darkness and night, farewell! The morn is here;
Welcome! the light that ushers in the day;
Visions of joy before our sight appear,
And, like the clouds, our sorrows melt away.
Great Son of God, immortal and renowned!
Brighter than morn the glory on Thy brow;
Crowns must be won, and Thou are nobly crowned,
For death is dead, and sin is vanquished now.

We are never, never weary of the grand old song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We can sing it loud as ever, with our faith more strong;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
O, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing,
For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing;
We are going by and by to the palace of a King!
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are rising on its pinions to the hills above:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are going to a palace that is built of gold;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His splendor we shall soon behold
Glory to God, hallelujah!
There we’ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad, new song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
There we’ll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood washed throng;
Glory to God, hallelujah!

Down at the cross where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His Name!
Glory to His Name, glory to His Name:
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His Name!
I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where He took me in;
Glory to His Name!
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
Glory to His Name!
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet,
Cast thy poor soul at the Savior’s feet;
Plunge in today, and be made complete;
Glory to His Name!

Jesus has loved me—wonderful Savior!
Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why;
Came He to rescue sinners all worthless,
My heart He conquered—for Him I would die.
Glory to Jesus—wonderful Savior!
Glory to Jesus, the One I adore;
Glory to Jesus—wonderful Savior!
Glory to Jesus and praise evermore.
Jesus has saved me—wonderful Savior!
Jesus has saved me, I cannot tell how;
All that I know is, He was my Ransom,
Dying on Calv’ry with thorns on His brow.
Jesus will lead me—wonderful Savior!
Jesus will lead me, I cannot tell where;
But I will follow, thro’ joy or sorrow,
Sunshine or tempest, sweet peace or despair.
Jesus will crown me—wonderful Savior!
Jesus will crown me, I cannot tell when;
White throne of splendor hail I with gladness,
Crowned ’mid the plaudits of angels and men.

Glory to thee, my God, this night,
for all the blessings of the light:
keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
beneath thine own almighty wings.
Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,
the ill that I this day have done;
that with the world, myself, and thee,
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.
Teach me to live, that I may dread
the grave as little as my bed;
teach me to die, that so I may
rise glorious at the awful day.
O may my soul on thee repose,
and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close;
sleep that shall me more vigorous make
to serve my God when I awake.
When in the night I sleepless lie,
my soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
no powers of darkness me molest.
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
praise him, all creatures here below;
praise him above, ye heavenly host:
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

Glory be to thee who safe hast kept,
and hast refreshed me whilst I slept;
grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake,
I may of endless light partake.
Lord, I may vows to thee renew;
scatter my sins as morning dew;
guard my first springs of thought and will,
and with thyself my spirit fill.
Direct, control, suggest, this day,
all I design, or do, or say;
that all my powers, with all their might,
in thy sole glory may unite.
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
praise him, all creatures here below;
praise him above, ye heavenly host;
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Glory to Thee, O Lord,
Who, from this world of sin,
By cruel Herod’s ruthless sword
Those precious ones didst win.
Baptized in their own blood,
Earth’s untried perils o’er,
They passed unconsciously the flood,
And safely gained the shore.
Glory to Thee for all
The ransomed infant band,
Who, since that hour have heard Thy call,
And reached the quiet land.
O that our hearts within,
Like theirs, were pure and bright,
O that as free from stain of sin
We shrank not from Thy sight.
Lord, help us every hour
Thy cleansing grace to claim;
In life to glorify Thy power,
In death to praise Thy Name.

Glory to Thee, O Lord,
Who by Thy mighty power
Didst manifest Thy glory forth
In Cana’s marriage hour.
Thou spakest: it was done:
Obedient to Thy word,
The water reddening into wine
Proclaimed the present Lord.
Blest were the eyes which saw
That wondrous mystery,
The great beginning of Thy works
That kindled faith in Thee.
And blessed they who know
Thine unseen presence true,
When in the kingdom of Thy grace
Thou makest all things new.
For by Thy loving hand
Thy people still are fed;
Thine is the cup of blessing, Lord,
And Thou the heavenly bread.
O may that grace be ours,
Ever in Thee to live,
And drink of those refreshing streams,
Which Thou alone canst give.
So, led from strength to strength,
Grant us, O Lord, to see
The marriage supper of the Lamb,
Thy great Epiphany.

I’m sailin’ up to heaven (heaven) on a ship called Glorybound
I want to see my King, so I’ve packed my things, for a voyage to the sky
When my ship comes in, a crown of life I’ll win, and I’ll bid this world goodbye
Walking with my Lord, I’m gonna step on board and lay my armor down
I’m sailin’ up to heaven (bass: heaven) on a ship called Glorybound
I’m gonna leave this world behind me (leave behind) 
Go sailin’ through the air (go sailin’ through the air) 
Gonna smile and wave goodbye (wave goodbye) 
To all the sorrow and care (to sorrow and care) 
And when I wake up to hear the trumpet sound
And then my feet start to leave the ground
I’m sailin’ up to heaven (heaven) on a ship called Glorybound
When the twilight falls, and my Captain calls
And He welcomes me on board
I will shout and sing, “By His blood redeemed," taken up to my reward 
Gonna cry no more, when I step ashore, where no sorrow can be found
I’m sailin’ up to heaven (heaven) on a ship called Glorybound 

There is an army that is marching on to victory
The captain is the man from Galilee
They've all been saved and their souls set free 
By the blood of the man on Calvary
So won't you join in this army and be saved today
Get on your knees and pray
Help lead the wrong to right
And join in the fight
And get in the Gloryland march
Glory hallelujah we are marching on as we sing this song
And it won't be long
The man from Galilee will set us everyone free 
So get in the Gloryland march
Blessed is the army that will follow God
Fighting for the Kingdom as we onward trod
Waiting for the moment when we'll leave the sod
To live and be forever in the presence of God
He will give us power over man of sin
We'll shout and enter in
You'll here the victory ring when we found the Saviour King
So get in the Gloryland march

I'm in the way, the bright and shining way
Yes, I'm in the gloryland way!
Telling the world that Jesus saves today
Yes, I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way) 
I'm in the gloryland way (I'm in the gloryland way)
I'm in the gloryland way (gloryland way)
Oh, Heaven is nearer and the way groweth clearer
For I'm in the gloryland way! (gloryland way) 
List to the call, the gospel call today
Get in the gloryland way
Wanderers, come home, O hasten to obey
For, I'm in the gloryland way! 
Onward I go rejoicing in His love
I'm in the gloryland way!
Soon I shall see Him in that home above
Oh, I'm in the gloryland way! 

I've sinned come on my knees- for I'm not worthy of your love
You are my purpose- You are the reason that I live
How could you die for me- such grace could only come from God
I want to be like You- Help me to love and to for- - - - - give 
Oh Lord, You search and you know me- you see me inside out
God let me not be distracted- Lord help me focus on You
God, you alone can forgive me- erase my fear and my doubt
Keep sin from ruling my life, Lord- make me holy and pure
Father You pick me up- I feel like a child in Your arms
Father You pick me up- I feel like a child in Your arms
I don't deserve this love but, I hear your voice Lord Jesus
I don't deserve this love but I hear Your voice Lord Jesus
Go and sin no more
He said "I will not condemn you, I'll forgive and I'll forget it all"
Go and sin no more
My child let me remind you it is I who'll lead and guide you as you go
Interlude:
Wipe, wipe away
Take, take away
Break, break away
Fill my life, make it right
Father help me, Father help me

Christians, wake, no longer sleep;
Shall we rest while others weep?
Shall we sit with folded hands
When the Lord Himself commands?
Go and work! this hour begin;
Go and seek the lost to win;
From the dark abodes of sin,
To the feast, oh, bring them in!
Do we love the Savior’s Name?
Can our faith His promise claim?
Have we pledged to Him our all?
Shall we not obey His call?
Do we trust Him as we ought?
Do we live as He has taught?
Are we His, and His alone?
Let our faith by works be shown.
There’s a cross that we must bear
If the crown we hope to wear:
Onward, then, with vigor new;
Time is short, the days are few.

Go bury thy sorrow, the world hath its share;
Go bury it deeply, go hide it with care.
Go think of it calmly, when curtained by night;
Go tell it to Jesus, and all will be right.
Go tell it to Jesus, He knoweth thy grief;
Go tell it to Jesus, He’ll send thee relief;
Go gather the sunshine He sheds on the way:
He’ll lighten thy burden—Go, weary one, pray.
Hearts growing aweary with heavier woe
Now droop ’mid the darkness—Go, comfort them, go!
Go bury thy sorrow, let others be blessed;
Go give them the sunshine, tell Jesus the rest.

When Israel was in Egypt´s Land:
Let my people go.
Oppress´d so hard they could not stand,
Let my people go.
Go down Moses
´way down in Egypt´s land
Tell ol´ Pharaoh,
Let my peoples go.
Thus saith the Lord, bold Moses said:
Let my people go.
If not I´ll smite your firstborn dead,
Let my people go.
O let us all from bondage flee;
Let my people go.
And let us all in Christ be free!
Let my people go.

Go forth with joy and gladness,
Go forth with love and song;
All honor, praise and glory
To Christ our Lord belong.
He has redeemed us by His blood.
Redeemed us from our sin;
Gather all the lost ones to His fold,
O haste, and bring them in.
Go forth with joy and gladness,
And spread the news afar;
Behold, He sends before us
A bright and lovely star.
Go forth with joy and gladness,
Proclaim the welcome sound,
Till all shall hear the story
To earth’s remotest bound.

Go forth at Christ’s command,
Go forth to ev’ry land,
Through loyalty to Christ
Through loyalty to Christ;
Let strong your efforts be
To gain the victory,
Through loyalty, yes, loyalty,
Through loyalty to Christ.
Onward, onward, army of the Lord!
There’s naught to fear while trusting in His Word;
Go forth to fight the wrong,
And shout the victor’s song,
Through loyalty, yes, loyalty,
Through loyalty to Christ.
Be brave to help them win
Who strive to conquer sin,
Through loyalty to Christ,
Through loyalty to Christ;
Point out the path of light,
Be strong to do the right,
Through loyalty, yes, loyalty,
Through loyalty to Christ.
See! Satan’s banners wave,
O haste the lost to save
Through loyalty to Christ,
Through loyalty to Christ;
Beat back the hosts of sin,
Press on the fight to win,
Through loyalty, yes, loyalty,
Through loyalty to Christ.
O children of the free!
Let this your watchword be:
“Through loyalty to Christ,
Through loyalty to Christ";
Let hills and valleys ring,
While men and angels sing,
Through loyalty, yes, loyalty,
Through loyalty to Christ.

Go forth to life, O child of earth!
Still mindful of thy heav’nly birth;
Thou art not here for ease, or sin,
But manhood’s noble crown to win.
Tho’ passion’s fires are in thy soul,
Thy spirit can their flames control;
Tho’ tempters strong beset thy way,
Thy spirit is more strong than they.
Go on from innocence of youth
To manly purity and truth;
God’s angels still are near to save,
And God Himself doth help the brave.
Then forth to life, O child of earth!
Be worthy of thy heav’nly birth!
For noble service thou art here;
Thy brothers help, thy God revere!

Go forward, Christian soldier,
Beneath His banner true:
The Lord Himself, thy Leader,
Shall all thy foes subdue.
His love foretells thy trials;
He knows thine hourly need;
He can with bread of Heaven
Thy fainting spirit feed.
Go forward, Christian soldier,
Fear not the secret foe;
Far more o’er thee are watching
Than human eyes can know:
Trust only Christ, thy Captain;
Cease not to watch and pray;
Heed not the treacherous voices
That lure thy soul astray.
Go forward, Christian soldier,
Nor dream of peaceful rest,
Till Satan’s host is vanquished
And Heav’n is all possessed;
Till Christ Himself shall call thee
To lay thine armor by,
And wear in endless glory
The crown of victory.
Go forward, Christian soldier,
Fear not the gath’ring night:
The Lord has been thy Shelter;
The Lord will be thy Light.
When morn His face revealeth,
Thy dangers are all past:
O pray that faith and virtue
May keep thee to the last!

Go, heralds of salvation, forth;
Go in your heavenly Master’s Name;
From east to west, from south to north,
The glorious Gospel wide proclaim.
Go forth to sow the living seed;
Seek not earth’s praise, nor dread its blame;
Nor labors fear, nor trials heed;
Go forth to conquer in His Name.
Lo, I am with you, saith the Lord,
My grace your spirit shall sustain;
Strong is My arm, and sure My Word;
My servants shall not toil in vain.
Go forth in hope; my burden take,
Till God’s great reaping day shall come;
Then they who sowed in tears shall wake,
And hail the joyful harvest home.

While drinking alone in a tap room one day
my eyes they hardly could see
I heard a voice ringing so loud and clear
and here's what that voice said to me 
Go home, go home and kneel by your bedside and pray
Go home, go home, God will answer your prayers today 
I staggered across the room to the door
I almost fell on the floor
I knew there was laughter but I could not hear
for the words that still rang in my ears 
Go home, go home and kneel by your bedside and pray
Go home, go home, God will answer your prayers today 
God sobered my mind and He saved my soul
and he raised my thoughts from all filth
then back to the tavern I preached His word
the words that still ring in my ears 
Go home, go home and kneel by your bedside and pray
Go home, go home, God will answer your prayers today 
The crowd started leaving with heads bowed so low
the bartender picked up the keys
as he locked the door he murmured these words
the same words God spoke to me 
Go home, go home and kneel by your bedside and pray
Go home, go home, God will answer your prayers today 

[D]Now let your[G]servant go in[A]peace, 
[Bm]Your word has been[G]fulfilled, 
[D]Now let your[G]servant go in[A]peace, 
[D]In the glory of Israel.
[D]My eyes have seen[G]salvation, 
[A]Which you surely have pre[D]pared, 
In the sight of every[G]people of[A]earth, 
A light to the[D]nations.
[D]This child is[G]destined, 
[A]For the downfall and[D]rise, 
Of many children of[G]Israel, 
This[A]child is contradiction's[D]sign.
[D]And you yourself shall be[G]pierced 
Through the heart[A]as with a[D]sword, 
That the thoughts and hearts of[G]many on[A]earth 
Shall surely be ex[D]posed.

Go on, Ye Pilgrims, While Below
In the sure paths of peace,
Determined nothing else to know
But Jesus and His grace.
Observe your Leader, follow Him,
He in this world has been
Often reviled, but like a Lamb,
Did ne'er revile again.
O take the pattern he has giv'n
And love your enemies;
And learn the only way to heav'n
In self-denial lies.
4, Remember, you must watch and pray,
While` journ'ying on the road;
Lest you should fall out by the way
And wound the cause of God.
Contend for nothing but the truth
That feeds th' immortal mind
For fruitless leaves, no more dispute
But leave them to the wind.
Go on rejoicing night and day,
Your crown is yet before;
Defy the trails of your way.
The storms will soon be o'er.

God's spirit is in my heart
He has called me and set me apart
This is what I have to do
What I have to do
Ch:He sent me to give good news to the poor
Tell prisoners that they are prisoners no more
Tell blind people that they can see,
And set the downtrodden free
And go tell everyone 
The news that the kingdom of God has come
Just as the Father sent me
So I'm sending out to be
My witnesses throughout the world
The whole of the world
Don't worry what You have to say
Donn't worry because on that day
God's spirit will speak in your heart
Will speak in your heart

When your heart with life’s burdens is weary,
And the pathway around you is drear,
There is one who is always beside you,
Your cry of distress He will hear.
Go tell your story to Jesus,
He is your Savior and Guide;
He came from above, in infinite love,
To save you on Calv’ry He died;
Trusting this gracious Redeemer,
You may your courage renew;
Go tell your story to Jesus,
Find out how much He loves you.
“Come to Me" is the kind invitation
Of Jesus, your Savior and Lord;
Lean on Him, there is rest in His bosom,
Find comfort in His holy Word.
When the trials of life are all ended,
When you reach the glad home of the blest,
You will dwell in the glory with Jesus,
Forever with Him you will rest.

Go to dark Gethsemane, ye that feel the tempter’s power;
Your Redeemer’s conflict see, watch with Him one bitter hour,
Turn not from His griefs away; learn of Jesus Christ to pray.
See Him at the judgment hall, beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;
O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs His soul sustained!
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; learn of Christ to bear the cross.
Calvary’s mournful mountain climb; there, adoring at His feet,
Mark that miracle of time, God’s own sacrifice complete.
“It is finished!" hear Him cry; learn of Jesus Christ to die.
Early hasten to the tomb where they laid His breathless clay;
All is solitude and gloom.Who has taken Him away?
Christ is risen! He meets our eyes; Savior, teach us so to rise.

Go to the deeps of God’s promise;
Ask freely of Him, and receive;
All good may be had for the asking,
If, seeking, you truly believe.
Go to the deeps of God’s promise;
There’s wideness of meaning untold
In the promises given His people,
And the treasures they ever unfold.
Go to the deeps of God’s promise;
And know of His wonderful might;
Whatever would be a true blessing,
For Jesus’ sake, comes as thy right.
Go to the deeps of God’s promise;
The blessing is never denied;
He loves, and remembers His children,
And every good thing is supplied.
Go to the deeps of God’s promise;
And claim whatsoever ye will;
The blessing of God will not fail thee,
His Word He will surely fulfill.

“Go work in My vineyard," there’s plenty to do;
The harvest is great and the lab’rers are few;
There’s weeding and fencing, and clearing of roots,
And plowing, and sowing, and gath’ring of fruits.
There are foxes to take, there are wolves to destroy,
All ages and ranks I can fully employ;
I’ve sheep to be tended, and lambs to be fed;
The lost must be gathered, the weary ones led.
Go work, go work, go work in My vineyard; there’s plenty to do;
Go work, go work, the harvest is great, and the lab’rers are few.
“Go work in My vineyard"; I claim thee as Mine;
With blood did I buy thee and all that is thine—
Thy time and thy talents, thy loftiest powers,
Thy warmest affections, thy sunniest hours.
I willingly yielded My kingdom for thee,
The song of archangels— to hang on the tree,
In pain and temptation, in anguish and shame,
I paid thy full ransom; My purchase I claim
“Go work in My vineyard"; oh, work while ’tis day!
The bright hours of sunshine are hastening away,
And night’s gloomy shadows are gathering fast;
The time for our labor will ever be past.
Begin in the morning and toil all the day;
Thy strength I’ll supply, and thy wages I’ll pay;
And blessed, thrice blessed, the diligent few,
Who finish the labor I’ve giv’n them to do.

Go work in the vineyard, ’tis Jesus commands,
Then why are we idle and folding our hands?
He speaks to the children and we must obey,
Go work in the vineyard, go labor today.
Sow in the morning the seed of the Word,
Sow in the morning and trust in the Lord,
He of our labor a record will keep;
Life everlasting and joy we shall reap.
Go forth in the vineyard, how earnest the call,
There’s work for the children, there’s plenty for all:
Too precious the moments to squander away,
Go work in the vineyard, go labor today.
Go work in the vineyard, how glad we should be
That Jesus is saying to you and to me,
The harvest is coming, arise! and away,
Go work in the vineyard, go labor today.
Go forth at His bidding our places to fill,
Go forth at His bidding and work with a will;
Grieve not the dear Savior by longer delay,
Go work in the vineyard, go labor today.

Far, far away, in heathen darkness dwelling,
[or …in death and darkness dwelling,]
Millions of souls forever may be lost;
Who, who will go, salvation’s story telling,
Looking to Jesus, heeding not the cost?
“All power is given unto Me,
All power is given unto Me,
Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel,
And lo, I am with you always."
See o’er the world wide open doors inviting,
Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!
Christians, awake! your forces all uniting,
Send forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin.
“Why will you die?" the voice of God is calling.
“Why will you die?" re-echo in His Name;
Jesus has died to save from death appalling,
Life and salvation, therefore go proclaim.
God speed the day, when those of every nation
“Glory to God!" triumphantly shall sing.
Ransomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salvation,
Shout “Hallelujah, for the Lord is King."

Go, ye messengers of God!
Like the beams of morning fly,
Take the wonder working rod,
Wave the banner cross on high;
Where the lofty minaret
Gleams along the morning skies,
Wave it till the crescent set,
And the Star of Jacob rise!
Go to many a tropic isle
In the bosom of the deep,
Where the skies forever smile
And the oppressed forever weep:
O’er their gloomy night of care
Pour the living light of heaven;
Chase away their dark despair,
Bid them hope to be forgiven!
Where the golden gates of day
Open on the palmy East,
Wide the bleeding cross display,
Spread the Gospel’s richest feast:
Bear the tidings round the ball,
Visit every soil and sea:
Preach the cross of Christ to all,
Jesus’ love is full and free!

Down from the glories of Heaven,
Down to the world of woe;
When there was no eye to pity,
Jesus said, “I will go."
Go, go, go, go,
Leave what He asks you to leave;
Pray for your part in the harvest,
Give what He asks you to give.
Out in the dark they are dying,
For them His life He gave;
Go, tell the lost of salvation,
Give them a chance to live.
“Uttermost part" is His order,
Dare any answer no?
What will you do when you meet Him,
If you refuse to go?

Lord I’m standing here
At this very moment
Asking my Jesus Christ
To take away all this torment
All remembrance of old bad times
I’ll never have again
O, Lord Jesus Christ, don’t forsake me!
I want to see such a great change
Come into me
If one day the sadness returns
It will find no place in my heart
No place anymore!
Go all sadness go! Go away from me!
Go and tell the devil
That now I have Jesus
Within my heart!

Go, labor on: spend, and be spent,
Thy joy to do the Father’s will:
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?
Go, labor on! ’tis not for naught
Thine earthly loss is heavenly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
The Master praises: what are men?
Go, labor on! enough, while here,
If He shall praise thee, if He deign
The willing heart to mark and cheer:
No toil for Him shall be in vain.
Go, labor on while it is day:
The world’s dark night is hastening on;
Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away;
It is not thus that souls are won.
Men die in darkness at thy side,
Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
Take up the torch and wave it wide,
The torch that lights time’s thickest gloom.
Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray,
Be wise the erring soul to win;
Go forth into the world’s highway,
Compel the wanderer to come in.
Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice!
For toil comes rest, for exile home;
Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom’s voice,
The midnight peal, “Behold, I come!"

“Go preach My Gospel," saith the Lord,
“Bid the whole earth My grace receive;
He shall be saved that trusts My word,
He shall be damned that won’t believe.
“I’ll make your great commission known,
And ye shall prove My Gospel true,
By all the works that I have done,
By all the wonders ye shall do.
“Go heal the sick, go raise the dead,
Go cast out devils in My Name;
Nor let My prophets be afraid,
Though Greeks reproach, and Jews blaspheme.
“Teach all the nations My commands,
I’m with you till the world shall end;
All power is trusted to My hands,
I can destroy, and I defend."
He spake, and light shone round His head;
On a bright cloud to Heav’n He rode;
They to the farthest nations spread
The grace of their ascended God.

Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born.
While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.
The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo! above the earth,
Rang out the angels 
That hailed the Savior’s birth.
Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.

I know that God ain't no stained glass window
And I believe there is a Holy Ghost
I know that God ain't no stained glass window
Cause He never keeps His window closed
There's so much I don't see
There's so much I don't see
I don't see how hair can turn silver-grey
I don't see why my prayers can't get answered right away
I don't see why some folks keep a load in their mind
With a sharp axe to grind.
And I don't understand why the truth takes a twist
I don't understand why there is loneliness
I don't know why they claim some men have no soul
But there's one thing I do know
G A D
No He never keeps His window closed

God and God alone created all these things we call our own 
From the mighty to the small the Glory in them all is God's and God's alone 
God and God alone is fit to take the universe's throne 
Let everything that lives reserve it's truest praise for God and God alone 
God and God alone reveals the truth of all we call unknown 
and the best and worst of man wont change the Master's plan it's God's and God's 
alone 
God and God alone will be the joy of our eternal home 
He will be our one desire Our hearts will never tire of God's and God's alone

I cried to God for mercy,
When I was lost in sin;
He heard my earnest pleadings,
And freely took me in.
God answered prayer for me,
He answered prayer for me;
If thou wilt pray, believing,
I know He’ll answer thee.
Praise God, I now am happy,
My soul is light and free,
The God that heard old Daniel
Has answered prayer for me.
Whene’er I meet with trouble,
To Him in prayer I go,
For He is always willing
To answer me, I know.
Oh, sinner, come to Jesus,
Call on His name today;
If thou wilt come, believing,
He’ll wash thy sins away.

God answers prayer, O do not doubt Him;
God answers prayer, believe His Word:
God answers prayer, now venture on Him,
His Word the test of time has stood.
God answers prayer, O soul, believe Him;
God answers prayer, I’ve proved Him true!
God answers prayer, now venture on Him;
He answered me, He’ll answer you.
God answers prayer, fear not to trust Him;
God answers prayer, He longs to save:
God answers prayer, look up believing,
For this His only Son He gave.
God answers prayer, O child so weary;
God answers prayer, pure you shall be:
God answers prayer, His blood availeth;
From self and sin He’ll make you free.
God answers prayer, I dare believe it;
God answers prayer, O praise His Name:
God answers prayer, and here this moment,
His love sets all my heart aflame.
God answers prayer in times of trial;
God answers prayer when all seems dark;
God answers prayer, He’ll safely guide you,
He loves and “knows the way you take."

God, be merciful to me,
On Thy grace I rest my plea;
Plenteous in compassion Thou,
Blot out my transgressions now;
Wash me, make me pure within,
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin.
My transgressions I confess,
Grief and guilt my soul oppress;
I have sinned against Thy grace
And provoked Thee to Thy face;
I confess Thy judgment just,
Speechless, I Thy mercy trust.
I am evil, born in sin;
Thou desirest truth within.
Thou alone my Savior art,
Teach Thy wisdom to my heart;
Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,
Wash me whiter than the snow.
Broken, humbled to the dust
By Thy wrath and judgment just,
Let my contrite heart rejoice
And in gladness hear Thy voice;
From my sins O hide Thy face,
Blot them out in boundless grace.
Gracious God, my heart renew,
Make my spirit right and true;
Cast me not away from Thee,
Let Thy Spirit dwell in me;
Thy salvation’s joy impart,
Steadfast make my willing heart.
Sinners then shall learn from me
And return, O God, to Thee;
Savior, all my guilt remove,
And my tongue shall sing Thy love;
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
And my mouth shall praise accord.

God be with you till we meet again;
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we meet again.
Till we meet, till we meet,
Till we meet at Jesus’ feet;
Till we meet, till we meet,
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again;
Neath His wings protecting hide you;
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again;
With the oil of joy anoint you;
Sacred ministries appoint you;
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again;
When life’s perils thick confound you;
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again;
Of His promises remind you;
For life’s upper garner bind you;
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again;
Sicknesses and sorrows taking,
Never leaving or forsaking;
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again;
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
Strike death’s threatening wave before you;
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again;
Ended when for you earth’s story,
Israel’s chariot sweep to glory;
God be with you till we meet again.

God bless America, land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Thru the night with a light from above
From the mountains (from the mountains) to the prairies (to the prairies)
To the oceans (to the oceans) white with foam (white with foam)
God bless America, my home sweet home
God bless America, my home sweet home 
God bless, God bless America (America)

America 
God bless America, land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Thru the night with a light from above
From the mountains (from the mountains) to the prairies (to the prairies)
To the oceans (to the oceans) white with foam (white with foam)
God bless America (God bless America), my home sweet home (my home sweet home)
God bless America (God bless America), my home sweet home 

God bless our native land!
Firm may she ever stand
Through storm and night!
When the wild tempests rave,
Ruler of wind and wave,
Father Eternal, save
Us by Thy might!
Lo! our hearts’ prayers arise
Into the upper skies,
Regions of light!
He Who hath heard each sigh,
Watches each weeping eye:
He is forever nigh,
Venger of Right.

Our Sunday school, our Sunday school
Is like a garden fair,
Where buds of promise grow and thrive
Beneath our Savior’s care.
And while within these happy walls
We gather now to pray,
Be this the burden of our prayer:
God bless our school today.
To Jesus let us give our hearts,
In childhood’s early spring,
And then, with true believing faith,
We all His love may sing.
To Jesus let us give our lives,
And serve Him with delight,
Before the summer days are gone,
And autumn takes its flight.
God bless our school from year to year,
And crown it with His love,
Till, one by one, He calls us home,
To dwell with Him above.

God, bless Your church with strength!
Wherever we may be,
Upbuild Your servants as we work
In common ministry.
Urge us from fledgling faith
To venture and to soar
Through open skies, to sing the praise
Of Christ whom we adore.
God, bless Your church with life!
May all our branches thrive,
Unblemished, wholesome, bearing fruit,
Abundantly alive.
From You, one holy vine,
In freedom may we grow;
Sustain us in our mission, Lord,
Your love and peace to show.
God, bless Your church with hope!
Despite chaotic days,
May we in chaos shine to light
A pathway through life’s maze.
May justice be our aim,
And kindness ours to share,
In humbleness O may we walk,
Assured our God is there!

If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life,
And I had to start again with just my children and my wife,
I'd thank my heavenly father to be living here today,
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that away.
And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free,
And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me,
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today,
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee,
Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea.
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A.,
There's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say:
God Bless the U.S.A.

God calling yet; shall I not hear?
Earth’s pleasures shall I still hold dear?
Shall life’s swift passing years all fly,
And still my soul in slumber lie?
God calling yet; shall I not rise?
Can I His loving voice despise,
And basely His kind care repay?
He calls me still—can I delay?
God calling yet, and shall He knock,
And I my heart the closer lock?
He still is waiting to receive,
And shall I dare His Spirit grieve?
Ah, yield Him all; in Him confide;
Where but with Him doth peace abide?
Break loose, let earthly bonds be riven,
And let the spirit rise to heaven.
God calling yet; and shall I give
No heed, but still in bondage live?
I wait, but He does not forsake;
He calls me still—my heart, awake!
God calling yet; I cannot stay;
My heart I yield without delay;
Vain world, farewell! from thee I part;
The voice of God hath reached my heart.

God can do anything, anything, anything
God can do anything but fail.
He's the Alpha and Omega
the beginning and the end,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
God can do anything, anything, anything
God can do anything but fail.
He can save, He can keep, He can cleanse, and He will,
God can do anything but fail.

God can do anything, anything, anything

Therefore I tell you
Do not be anxious about your life (2x)
What you shall eat
Or what you shall drink
Nor about your body
What you shall put on
Is not life more than food
And the body more than clothing? (2x)
Look at the birds of the air
They neither toil nor reap
Nor gather into barns
Nor gather into barns
Yet your heavenly Father feeds them
Are you not of more value than these?
And which of you by being anxious
Can add one cubit to his span of life?

God eternal, Lord of all,
Lowly at Thy feet we fall;
All the earth doth worship Thee;
We amidst the throng would be.
All the holy angels cry,
“Hail, thrice holy, God most high!"
Lord of all the heavenly powers,
Be the same loud anthem ours.
Glorified apostles raise
Night and day continual praise;
Hast Thou not a mission, too,
For Thy children here to do?
With Thy prophets’ goodly line
We in mystic bond combine;
For Thou hast to babes revealed
Things that to the wise were sealed.
Martyrs, in a noble host,
Of Thy cross are heard to boast;
Since so bright the crown they wear,
Early we Thy cross would bear.
All Thy Church in Heav’n and earth
Jesus, hail Thy spotless birth,
Own the God Who all has made,
And the Spirit’s soothing aid.
Offspring of a virgin’s womb,
Slain, and Victor o’er the tomb,
Seated on the judgment throne,
Number us among Thine own.

God eternal, mighty King,
Unto Thee our praise we bring;
All the earth doth worship Thee;
We amid the throng would be.
Holy, holy, holy! cry
Angels, round Thy throne on high
Lord of all the heav’nly pow’rs,
Be the same loud anthem ours.
Glorified apostles raise
Night and day, continual praise;
Hast not Thou a mission, too,
For Thy children here to do?
With the prophets’ goodly line
We in mystic bond combine;
For Thou hast to babes revealed
Things that to the wise were sealed.
Martyrs, in a noble host,
Of the cross are heard to boast;
Oh, that we our cross may bear,
And a crown of glory wear.
God eternal, mighty King,
Unto Thee our praise we bring;
To the Father, and the Son,
And the Spirit, Three in One.

God forgave my sin in Jesus’ name,
I’ve been born again in Jesus’ name;
And in Jesus’ name I come to you
To share His love as He told me to.
He said: ‘Freely, freely, you have received,
Freely, freely give;
Go in My name, and because you believe
Others will know that I live.’
All power is given in Jesus’ name,
In earth and heaven in Jesus’ name;
And in Jesus’ name I come to you
To share His power as He told me to.
He said: ‘Freely, freely, you have received,
Freely, freely give;
Go in My name, and because you believe
Others will know that I live.’

God from on high hath heard;
Let sighs and sorrows cease;
Lo! from the opening Heav'n descends
To man the promised Peace.
Hark! through the silent night
Angelic voices swell;
Their joyful songs proclaim that "God
Is born on earth to dwell."
See how the shepherd band
Speed on with eager feet;
Come to the hallowed cave with them
The Holy Babe to greet.
But, oh, what sight appears
Within that lowly door!
A manger, stall, and swaddling clothes,
A Child and mother poor!
Art Thou the Christ? the Son?
The Father's image bright?
And see we Him Whose arm upholds
Earth and the starry height?
Yea, faith can pierce the cloud
Which veils Thy glory now;
We hail Thee, God, before Whose throne
The angels prostrate bow.
A silent Teacher, Lord,
Thou bidd'st us not refuse
To bear what flesh would have us shun,
To shun what flesh would choose.
Our sinful pride to cure
With that pure love of Thine,
O be Thou born within our hearts,
Most Holy Child divine.

God gave His Son for me, O wondrous love!
From sin to set me free, O wondrous love!
A guilty rebel I, bound and condemned to die,
He did not pass me by, O wondrous love!
A guilty rebel I, bound and condemned to die,
He did not pass me by, O wondrous love!
There, there at God’s right hand, O wondrous love!
I see my Savior stand, O wondrous love!
He makes my nature pure, in Him I am secure;
Whatever I endure; O wondrous love!
He makes my nature pure, in Him I am secure;
Whatever I endure; O wondrous love!
He’ll give me needful grace, O wondrous love!
Soon I shall see His face, O wondrous love!
Join those who’ve gone before, sorrow and pain all o’er,
Heav’n, Heaven, forevermore! O wondrous love!
Join those who’ve gone before, sorrow and pain all o’er,
Heav’n, Heaven, forevermore! O wondrous love!

Selfish ambition
The truth it is denied
Oh the bitter envy
It's a spiritual demise 
Battles burn within you
Passions pounding your heart
All for your own pleasure
That's how you play the part 
God gives grace to the humble (God gives grace, God gives grace, God gives 
grace, God gives grace)
Everything your hearts desire (God gives grace, God gives grace, God gives 
grace, God gives grace)
Even when we fall and stumble (God gives grace, God gives grace, God gives 
grace, God gives grace)
God gives grace to the humble (God gives grace, God gives grace, God gives 
grace, God gives grace)
God gives grace to the humble
God gives grace to the humble
God gives grace to the humble
God gives grace to the humble 
Devilish motivation
Your love is crucified
Strife and segregation
Quarrels and endless fights 
Godly opposition
Surely justified
Holy acquisition
Victim of evil pride 
God gives grace to the humble
Thinkin' you can be a friend of the world?
God gives grace to the humble
Change the rules from day to day? 
God gives grace to the humble
Pride is your home, you don't understand 
God gives grace to the humble
Why things can't be my way 
God gives grace to the humble (God gives grace, God gives grace, God gives 
grace, gives grace to the humble)

God gives His mercies to be spent;
Your hoard will do your soul no good.
Gold is a blessing only lent,
Repaid by giving others food.
The world’s esteem is but a bribe,
To buy their peace you sell your own;
The slave of a vainglorious tribe,
Who hate you while they make you known.
The joy that vain amusements give,
O! sad conclusion that it brings!
The honey of a crowded hive,
Defended by a thousand stings.
’Tis thus the world rewards the fools
That live upon her treacherous smiles:
She leads them, blindfold, by her rules,
And ruins all whom she beguiles.
God knows the thousands who go down
From pleasure into endless woe;
And with a long despairing groan
Blaspheme their Maker as they go.
Oh fearful thought! be timely wise;
Delight but in a Savior’s charms,
And God shall take you to the skies,
Embraced in everlasting arms.

God has a plan for each of His creatures
To the stars He gives the skies
And for every stream there is a riverbed
And a path He has laid for me
My life I give to God
Because Jesus gave His own for me
No matter where I go
I’ll follow my Lord
Over land or sea
Where He sends me, I’ll go
Even the sand on the seashore is all numbered
And the tides never flood the land
And the birds in their course obey His voice
And His breath makes the flowers bloom
In His will, I find peace in life
And blessings that I never tasted
And though much sadness
Comes with tribulations
I have faith God is by my side

There is a party
He doesn't have many social graces
A definite party
But he just seems to watch the faces turn away
When he tries to play their games
And he sits as he stays while the cliques and clichés 
Fill the room like a cold, cold wind
Hoping for nothing more
Than to be treated like a friend (Treated like a friend) 
God has chosen those who are poor (God has chosen)
In the eyes of the world to be rich in faith (faithful ones)
God has chosen those who are poor (God has chosen)
In the eyes of the world to receive his grace (rich in grace)
(And this kingdowm) And the kingdom He has promised
(Those who love Him) To those who love Him so
God has chosen those who will follows His ways (those who will follow His, 
follow His ways) 
Every Sunday
Everyone sits in their normal pews
It's a regular Sunday 
Passing around all the gossip and news
We cultivate our social circles once more
Then we hurry away to get on with the day
Say goodbye with an empty grin
Passing by a brother who's trying to find the Lord again 
God has chosen those who are poor (God has chosen)
In the eyes of the world to be rich in faith (faithful ones) (to be rich in 
faith)
God has chosen those who are poor (God has chosen)
In the eyes of the world to receive his grace (rich in grace) (amazing grace)
(And this kingdowm) And the kingdom He has promised
(Those who love Him) To those who love Him so
God has chosen those who will follows His ways (those who will follow His, 
follow His ways) 
The riches of this evil world
Are only fleeting things (only fleeting thindgs)
So live for Him and find the wealth
That only He can bring 
God has chosen those who will follow
Those who will follow His ways 

God has given you His promise
That He hears and answers prayer.
He will heed your supplication
If you cast on Him your care.
He will answer every prayer,
He will answer every prayer,
Go to Him in faith believing,
He will answer every prayer.
He will not withhold one blessing,
He will give you what is best.
God will answer by His Spirit,
Every one who makes request.
He can hear the great petition,
And the smallest, over there.
Unto God pray without ceasing,
He will answer every prayer.
Take to God your plans and failures,
Any time and anywhere.
No one ever goes unanswered,
For He answers every prayer.

This morning I picked up a paper
I read about tragedy I stopped and
I realized that it could've been me oh oh
That could've been my mother
Or maybe even my big brother
But You kept them just like You kept me
I want to tell You that
God has smiled on me
He has set me free
God has smiled on
He has been good to me
Now I've been through some things that
I thought were unnecessarily 
Were way too much to carry
All by myself
Yeah! But You gave me strength to
Make it through
I thought I couldn't take it 
Feels so good to know that You care
Yeah, yeah, yeah, God
God has smiled on me
He has set me free
God has smiled on
He has been good to me
So glad I know You 
Glad You're my Friend
Whenever I need You 
You're always near
You don't have to be so good to me
But You keep on smiling
God has smiled on me
He has set me free
God has smiled on
He has been good to me

God hath not promised skies always blue,
Flower strewn pathways all our lives through;
God hath not promised sun without rain,
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above,
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.
God hath not promised we shall not know
Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
He hath not told us we shall not bear
Many a burden, many a care.
God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,
Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;
Never a mountain rocky and steep,
Never a river turbid and deep.

God hath sent His angels to the earth again,
Bringing joyful tidings to the sons of men;
They who first at Christmas thronged the heavenly way,
Now beside the tomb door sit on Easter day.
Angels, sing His triumph as you sang His birth,
“Christ the Lord is risen, peace, goodwill on earth!"
In the dreadful desert, where the Lord was tried,
There the faithful angels gathered at His side;
And when, in the garden, grief and pain and care
Bowed Him down with anguish, they were with Him there.
Yet the Christ they honor is the same Christ still
Who, in light and darkness, did His Father’s will;
And the tomb, deserted, shineth like the sky,
Since He passed from out it, into victory.
God has still His angels, helping at His word,
All His faithful children, like their faithful Lord;
Soothing them in sorrow, arming them in strife,
Opening wide the tomb doors, leading into life.

God help our country to be strong,
’Gainst all the battle-hosts of wrong;
In all we pledge or think or do
God help our country to be true.
God hold our nation’s aim sincere,
God save her heart from coward fear,
God prosper her with true success,
And crown her head with worthiness.
From foe without and foe within,
From open shame and hidden sin,
From boastful pride and greedy store,
God keep our nation evermore!

God Himself is present:
Let us now adore Him
And with awe appear before Him.
God is in His temple--
All within keep silence,
Prostrate lie with deepest reverence.
Him alone God we own,
Him, our God and Savior;
Praise His name forever.
God Himself is present:
Hear the harps resounding;
See the hosts the throne surrounding!
"Holy, holy, holy"--
Hear the hymn ascending,
Songs of saints and angels blending.
Bow Thine ear To us here:
Hear, O Christ, the praises
That Thy Church now raises.
O Thou Fount of blessing,
Purify my spirit,
Trusting only in Thy merit.
Like the holy angels,
Who behold Thy glory,
May I ceaselessly adore Thee.
Let Thy will Ever still
Rule Thy Church terrestrial
As the hosts celestial.

God Himself is with us: Let us now adore Him,
And with awe appear before Him.
God is in His temple, all within keep silence,
Prostrate lie with deepest reverence.
Him alone God we own, Him our God and Savior;
Praise His Name forever.
God Himself is with us: Hear the harps resounding!
See the crowds the throne surrounding!
“Holy, holy, holy," hear the hymn ascending,
Angels, saints, their voices blending!
Bow Thine ear to us here: Hear, O Christ, the praises
That Thy church now raises.
O Thou fount of blessing, purify my spirit;
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Like the holy angels who behold Thy glory,
May I ceaselessly adore Thee,
And in all, great and small, seek to do most nearly
What Thou lovest dearly.

Dread not the things that are ahead,
The burdens great, the sinking sands,
The thorns that o’er the path are spread,
God holds the future in His hands.
God holds the future in His hands
And every heart He understands.
On Him depend,
He is your Friend,
He holds the future in His hands.
We know not what tomorrow hides,
Of sun or storm or good or ill;
We only know His dear hand guides,
And He will be our Father still.
His hand created earth and sky,
The zephyrs and the storms that rage,
And years to come and years gone by
To Him are but an open page.
Live close to Him and trust His love,
Assured that while on earth we roam,
Whate’er may come, He bends above
To guide His children safely home.

God holds the key of all unknown,
And I am glad;
If other hands should hold the key,
Or if He trusted it to me,
I might be sad, I might be sad.
What if tomorrow’s cares were here
Without its rest!
I’d rather He unlocked the day;
And, as the hours swing open, say,
“My will is best, My will is best."
The very dimness of my sight
Makes me secure;
For, groping in my misty way,
I feel His hand; I hear Him say,
“My help is sure, My help is sure."
I cannot read His future plans;
But this I know;
I have the smiling of His face,
And all the refuge of His grace,
While here below, while here below.
Enough! this covers all my wants,
And so I rest!
For what I cannot, He can see,
And in His care I saved shall be,
Forever blest, forever blest.

God, how can we comprehend—though we’ve seen them times before—
Lines of people without end fleeing danger, want, and war?
They seek safety anywhere, hoping for a welcome hand!
Can we know the pain they bear? Help us, Lord, to understand!
You put music in their souls; now they struggle to survive.
You gave each one gifts and goals; now they flee to stay alive.
God of outcasts, may we see how you value everyone,
For each homeless refugee is your daughter or your son.
Lord, your loving knows no bounds; you have conquered death for all.
May we hear beyond our towns to our distant neighbors’ call.
Spirit, may our love increase; may we reach to all your earth,
Till your whole world lives in peace; till we see each person’s worth.

God in heaven hath a treasure, riches none may count or tell;
Hath a deep eternal pleasure, Christ, the Son, He loveth well.
God hath here on earth a treasure, none but He its price may know—
Deep, unfathomable pleasure, Christ revealed in saints below.
Christ, the Light that fills the heavens, shining forth on earth beneath,
Through His Spirit freely given, Light of life ’midst shades of death;
Down from heaven’s unclouded glory God Himself the treasure brought,
Closing thus His love’s sweet story with His sweetest, deepest thought.
God in tongues of fire descending, chosen vessels thus to fill
With the treasure never ending, ever spent—unfailing still.
Still unwasted, undiminished, though the days of dearth wear on,
Store eternally unfinished, fresh, as if but now begun.
Earthen vessels, marred, unsightly, but the treasure as of old,
Fresh from glory, gleaming brightly, heaven’s undimmed, unchanging gold.
God’s own hand the vessel filling from the glory far above,
Longing hearts forever stilling with those riches of His love.
Thus, through earthen vessels only, shining forth in ceaseless grace,
Reaching weary hearts and lonely, beams the light in Jesus’ face.
Vessels worthless, broken, bearing through the hungry ages on,
Riches given with hand unsparing, God’s great gift, His precious Son.
Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted, glorious calling, saint, is thine;
Let the Lord but find thee emptied, living branch in Christ the Vine!
Vessels of the world’s despising, vessels weak, and poor, and base;
Bearing wealth God’s heart is prizing, glory from Christ’s blessed face.
Oh, to be but emptier, lowlier, mean, unnoticed, and unknown.
And to God a vessel holier, filled with Christ, and Christ alone!
Naught of earth to cloud the glory, naught of self the light to dim.
Telling forth His wondrous story, emptied—to be filled with Him.

God, in the Gospel of His Son,
Makes His eternal counsels known;
Where love in all its glory shines,
And truth is drawn in fairest lines.
Here sinners of a humble frame
May taste His grace, and learn His Name;
May read, in characters of blood,
The wisdom, power, and grace of God.
The prisoner here may break his chains;
The weary rest from all his pains;
The captive feel his bondage cease;
The mourner find the way of peace.
Here faith reveals to mortal eyes
A brighter world beyond the skies;
Here shines the light which guides our way
From earth to realms of endless day.
O grant us grace, Almighty Lord,
To read and mark Thy holy Word;
Its truths with meekness to receive,
And by Its holy precepts live.

God, in the riches of His grace,
Did from eternity ordain
A seed elect of Adam's race,
Eternal glory should obtain.
God, in the riches of his grace,
Hath Christ exalted over all;
His goings forth, of old we trace
The sinner's Surety in the fall.
God, in the riches of his grace,
Hath Abra'm's seed exalted high;
While His redeemed shall see His face,
And reign with Him above the sky.
God, in the riches of His Grace,
Hath ot the charge of Jesus laid
The sin of all that chosen race,
Whose debt of suff'ring Jesus paid.
God, in the riches of His Grace,
Hath, in the gospel, Christ displayed,
Whose blood hath sealed the sinner's peace,
And bruised the venomed serpent's head.
God, in the riches of His Grace,
We'll to eternity adore;
And wonders still on wonders trace,
But ne'er his depth of love explore.

God inhabits our praise
God inhabits our praise 
God inhabits our praise
He lives in each heartfelt word
Each note that we sing, all things that we bring
Make our building of praise for our Lord
God inhabits our praise
He lives in each heartfelt word

In our building of praise to the Lord 
God inhabits our praise
He lives in each heartfelt word
When we give him heart, he will never depart
From our building of praise to our Lord
God inhabits our praise
He lives in each heartfelt word
When we lift up his name, His love will remain
From our building of praise to our Lord 
My God, inhabit our praise
Lord, live in heartfelt word
In this haven of peace, let our anxious thoughts cease
In our building of praise to the Lord

Make our building of praise for our Lord
God inhabits our praise
He lives in each heartfelt word
We invite him inside, ask his love to abide
In our building of praise to the Lord

God is the Name my soul adores,
The almighty Three, the eternal One;
Nature and grace, with all their powers,
Confess the Infinite Unknown.
Thy voice produced the sea and spheres,
Bade the waves roar, the planets shine;
But nothing like Thyself appears
Through all these spacious works of Thine.
Still restless nature dies and grows;
From change to change the creatures run:
Thy being no succession knows,
And all Thy vast designs are one.
A glance of Thine runs through the globe,
Rules the bright worlds, and moves their frame;
Of light Thou form’st Thy dazzling robe;
Thy ministers are living flame.
How shall polluted mortals dare
To sing Thy glory or Thy grace?
Beneath Thy feet we lie afar,
And see but shadows of Thy face.
Who can behold the blazing light?
Who can approach the consuming flame?
None but Thy wisdom knows Thy might
None but Thy Word can speak Thy Name.

God is a Stronghold and a Tower,
A Help that never faileth,
A covering Shield, a Sword of power,
When Satan’s host assaileth.
In vain our crafty foe
Still strives to work us woe,
Still lurks and lies in wait
With more than earthly hate;
We will not faint, nor tremble.
Frail sinners are we: naught remains
For hope or consolation,
Save in His strength Whom God ordains
Our Captain of salvation.
Yes, Jesus Christ alone
The Lord of hosts we own,
God ere the world began,
The Word-made-flesh for man,
Still conquering, and to conquer.
Though fiercely strive the hosts of ill
Within us, and around us,
With fiendish strength, and fiendish skill,
Yet ne’er may they confound us.
Man’s night of dark despair,
When storm clouds fill the air,
In God’s triumphal hour,
The noonday of His power,
One word, and He prevaileth.
Our Father’s truth abideth sure;
Christ, our Redeemer, liveth;
For us He pleads His offering pure,
To us His Spirit giveth.
Though dear ones pass away,
Though strength and life decay,
Yet loss shall be our gain,
For God doth still remain
Our All-in-all forever.

God is always near me,
Hearing what I say;
Knowing all my thoughts and deeds,
All my work and play.
God is always near me,
In the darkest night,
He can see me just the same
As by midday light.
God is always near me,
Though so young and small;
Not a look, or word, or thought,
But God knows it all.

God is calling the prodigal, come without delay,
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee.
Tho’ you’ve wandered so far from His presence, come today,
Hear His loving voice calling still.
Calling now for thee, O weary prodigal, come;
Calling now for thee, O weary prodigal, come.
Patient, loving and tenderly still the Father pleads,
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee;
Oh! return while the Spirit in mercy intercedes,
Hear His loving voice calling still.
Come, there’s bread in the house of the Father, and to spare,
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee;
Lo! the table is spread and the feast is waiting there,
Hear His loving voice calling still.

Is God calling thee, O guilty sinner?—
Satan has long on thee imposed—
Or has the Spirit gone forever?
Is thy heart’s door against Him closed.
Come, sinner, God is calling thee;
Come, sinner, God is calling thee;
He is pleading, interceding;
Come, God is calling thee.
Is God calling thee? Wilt thou not hear Him?
Sinner, He’s pleading now for thee;
In pity His Spirit draws thee near Him,
Mercy and love are shown so free.
Is God calling thee in great compassion?
Then let thy heart this Christ receive;
He died on the cross to seal thy pardon;
How canst thou thus His Spirit grieve? 
Is God calling thee? Then wait no longer;
Canst thou His pleading voice despise?
If thou wilt obey, ’twill make thee stronger—
From sin and guilt thou canst arise.
Yes, God’s calling me, and shall I slight Him?
With this vain world for aye be lost?
For His greater love I’ll not betray Him,
No, I’ll be His at any cost.

God is dwelling in my heart
He and I are one
All his joy He gives to me
Through Christ his son
And with Jesus in my heart
What have I to fear
For He is the Son of God
In my heart He's near
Christians who are baptized
Have You ever realized
The great mystery
God dwells in You and me.
This joy God gave to You
Share it, with others too
Tell them, that God is love
Lift their hearts above 

See the shining dewdrops
On the flowers strewed,
Proving as they sparkle,
“God is ever good,
Ever good."
See the morning sunbeams
Lighting up the wood,
Silently proclaiming,
“God is ever good,
Ever good."
Hear the mountain streamlet
In its solitude,
With its ripple saying,
“God is ever good,
Ever good."
He Who came to save us
Shed His precious blood;
Better things it speaketh:
“God is ever good,
Ever good."
Bring, my heart, thy tribute,
Songs of gratitude;
All things join to tell us,
“God is ever good,
Ever good."

God is gone up on high,
With a triumphant noise;
The clarions of the sky
Proclaim the angelic joys!
Join all on earth, rejoice and sing;
Glory ascribe to glory’s King.
God in the flesh below,
For us He reigns above:
Let all the nations know
Our Jesu’s conquering love!
Join all on earth, rejoice and sing;
Glory ascribe to glory’s King.
All power to our great Lord
Is by the Father given;
By angel hosts adored,
He reigns supreme in Heav’n:
Join all on earth, rejoice and sing;
Glory ascribe to glory’s King.
High on His holy seat
He bears the righteous sway;
His foes beneath His feet
Shall sink and die away:
Join all on earth, rejoice and sing;
Glory ascribe to glory’s King.
His foes and ours are one,
Satan, the world, and sin;
But He shall tread them down.
And bring His kingdom in:
Join all on earth, rejoice and sing;
Glory ascribe to glory’s King.
Till all the earth, renewed
In righteousness divine,
With all the hosts of God
In one great join,
Join all on earth, rejoice and sing;
Glory ascribe to glory’s King.

God is good (God is good)
All the time (all the time)
God is good (God is good)
All the time (all the time)
Well, He’s filled with compassion,
And His mercies are everlastin’.
God is good; God is good, all the time.
O give thanks (O give thanks)
Unto the Lord (Unto the Lord)
O give thanks (O give thanks)
Unto the Lord (Unto the Lord)
Well, He’s filled with compassion,
And His mercies are everlastin’.
God is good; God is good, all the time.

Songbirds in the woodlands sing it,
Flowers breathe it in the grove,
Bells in tow’r and steeple ring it,—
God is goodness, God is love.
Lift your voices, happy, happy voices,
And the sunny hours of life improve;
Praise Him for His countless blessings,—
God is goodness, God is love.
Smiling plains and vales display it,
Breezes tell it as they rove,
Rivers, rills, and brooklets say it,—
God is goodness, God is love.
Lakes and seas with joy reveal it,
Suns proclaim it from above,
In our hearts today we feel it,—
God is goodness, God is love.

God is here! As we his people
meet to offer praise and prayer,
may we find in fuller measure
what it is in Christ we share:
Here, as in the world around us,
all our varied skills and arts
wait the coming of His Spirit
into open minds and hearts
Here are symbols to remind us
of our lifelong need of grace;
here are table, font and pulpit,
here the cross has central place.
Here in honesty of preaching,
here in silence, as in speech,
here in newness and renewal
God the Spirit comes to each.
Here our children find a welcome
in the Shepherd's flock and fold;
here as bread and wine are taken,
Christ sustains us as of old.
Here the servants of the Servant
seek in worship to explore
what it means in daily living
to believe and to adore.
Lord of all, of Church and Kingdom,
in an age of change and doubt,
keep us faithful to the gospel,
help us work your purpose out.
Here, in this day's dedication,
all we have to give, receive;
we who cannot live without you,
we adore you! We believe.

God is here, and that to bless us
With the Spirit’s quick’ning power;
See, the cloud already bending,
Waits to drop the grateful shower.
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee,
Let the shower of blessing fall;
We are waiting, we are waiting,
Oh, revive the hearts of all.
God is here! we feel His presence
In this consecrated place;
But we need the soul refreshing
Of His free, unbounded grace.
God is here! oh, then, believing,
Bring to Him our one desire,
That His love may now be kindled,
Till its flame each heart inspire.
Savior, grant the prayer we offer,
While in simple faith we bow,
From the windows of Thy mercy
Pour us out a blessing now.

This is no time for fear
This I a time for faith and determination
Don’t lose the vision here
Carried away by the motion
Hold on to all that you hide in your heart
There is one thing that has always been true
It holds the world together
God is in control
We believe that His children will not be forsaken
God is in control
We will choose to remember and never be shaken
There is no power above or beside Him
We know, ohh, God is in control
Ohh, God is in control
History marches on
There is a bottom line drawn across the ages
Culture can make its plan
Oh but the line never changes
No matter how the deception may fly
There is one thing that has always been true
It will be true forever
God is in control
We believe that His children will not be forsaken
God is in control
We will choose to remember and never be shaken
There is no power above or beside Him
We know, ohh, God is in control
Ohh, God is in control
He has never let you down
Why start to worry now
Why start to worry now
He is still the Lord of all we see
And He is still the loving Father
Watching over you and me
Watching over you
Watching over me
Watching over everything
Watching over you
Watching over me
Every little sparrow
Every little king
Ohh, every little king
God is in control
We believe that His children will not be forsaken
God is in control
We will choose to remember and never be shaken
There is no power above or beside Him
We know, ohh, God is in control
Ohh, God is in control

God is in His temple, the almighty Father!
Round His footstool let us gather;
Him with adoration, serve the Lord most holy,
Who hath mercy on the lowly.
Let us raise hymns of praise for His great salvation;
God is in His temple!
Christ comes to His temple; we, His Word receiving,
Are made happy in believing.
Lo! from sin delivered, He hath turned our sadness,
Our deep gloom to light and gladness!
Let us raise hymns of praise, for our bonds are severed;
Christ comes to His temple!
Come and claim Thy temple, gracious Holy Spirit!
In our hearts Thy home inherit;
Make in us Thy dwelling, Thy high work fulfilling,
Into ours Thy will instilling;
Till we raise hymns of praise, beyond mortal telling,
In the eternal temple!

God is keeping His soldiers fighting,
Evermore we shall conquerors be;
All the hosts of Hell are uniting,
But we’re sure to have victory.
Though to beat us they’ve been trying,
Our colors still are flying,
And our flag shall wave forever,
For we never will give in.
No, we never, never, never will give in,
No we won’t! No we won’t!
No, we never, never, never will give in,
For we mean to have the victory forever.
We will follow our conquering Savior,
From before Him Hell’s legions shall fly;
Our battalions never shall waver,
They’re determined to conquer or die.
From holiness and Heaven
We never will be driven;
We will stand our ground forever,
For we never will give in.
With salvation for every nation,
To the ends of the earth we will go,
With a free and full salvation,
All the power of the cross we’ll show.
We’ll tear Hell’s throne to pieces,
And win the world for Jesus,
We’ll be conquerors forever,
For we never will give in.

God is known among His people,
Every mouth His praises fill;
From of old He has established
His abode on Zion’s hill;
There He broke the sword and arrow,
Bade the noise of war be still.
Excellent and glorious art Thou,
With Thy trophies from the fray;
Thou hast slain the valiant hearted,
Wrapped in sleep of death are they;
When Thine anger once is risen,
Who can stand in that dread day?
When from Heav’n Thy sentence sounded,
All the earth in fear was still,
While to save the meek and lowly
God in judgment wrought His will;
E’en the wrath of man shall praise Thee,
Thy designs it shall fulfill.
Vow and pay ye to Jehovah,
Him your God forever own;
All men, bring your gifts before Him,
Worship Him, and Him alone;
Mighty kings obey and fear Him,
Princes bow before His throne.

God is love, by Him upholden,
Hang the glorious orbs of light,
In their language, glad and golden,
Speaking to us day and night
Their great story,
God is love, and God is light.
Through that precious love He sought us
Wandering from His holy ways;
With that precious life He bought us;
Then let all our future days
Tell this story,
Love is life, our lives be praise.
Gladsome is the theme and glorious,
Praise to Christ our gracious Head;
Christ, the risen Christ, victorious,
Earth and hell hath captive led.
Welcome story!
Love lives on, and death is dead.
Up to Him let each affection
Daily rise and round Him move,
Our whole lives one resurrection
To the life of life above;
Their glad story,
God is life, and God is love.

God is love; His mercy brightens
All the path in which we rove;
Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens:
God is wisdom, God is love.
Chance and change are busy ever;
Man decays and ages move;
But His mercy waneth never:
God is wisdom, God is love.
E’en the hour that darkest seemeth
Will His changeless goodness prove;
From the mist His brightness streameth:
God is wisdom, God is love.
He with earthly cares entwineth
Hope and comfort from above;
Everywhere His glory shineth:
God is wisdom, God is love.

God is our refuge and our strength
A very close help in times of trouble
He’s our fortress and deliverer
Our protection in the battle,
our protection in the battle
Though the earth should be moved
Though mountains slip into the sea
Though all nations fall apart
We’ll not fear, the Lord is here
We’ll not fear, the Lord is here
(doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)

God is our Refuge and Defense;
In trouble our unfailing Aid;
Secure in His omnipotence,
What foe can make our souls afraid?
Yea, though the earth’s foundations rock,
And mountains down the gulf be hurled,
His people smile amid the shock:
They look beyond this transient world.
There is a river pure and bright,
Whose streams make glad the heavenly plains;
Where, in eternity of light,
The city of our God remains.
Built by the Word of His command,
With His unclouded presence blest,
Firm as His throne the bulwarks stand,
There is our home, our hope, our rest.

God is our Refuge and our Strength,
Our ever present Aid,
And, therefore, though the earth remove,
We will not be afraid;
Though hills amidst the sea be cast,
Though foaming waters roar,
Yes, though the mighty billows shake
The mountains on the shore.
A river flows whose streams make glad
The city of our God,
The holy place wherein the Lord
Most High has His abode;
Since God is in the midst of her,
Unmoved her walls shall stand,
For God will be her early help,
When trouble is at hand.
The nations raged, the kingdoms moved,
But when His voice was heard
The troubled earth was stilled to peace
Before His mighty Word.
The Lord of Hosts is on our side,
Our safety is secure;
The God of Jacob is for us
A refuge strong and sure.
O come, behold what wondrous works
Jehovah’s hand has wrought;
Come, see what desolation great
He on the earth has brought.
To utmost ends of all the earth
He causes war to cease;
The weapons of the strong destroyed,
He makes abiding peace.
Be still and know that I am God,
O’er all exalted high;
The subject nations of the earth
My Name shall magnify.
The Lord of Hosts is on our side,
Our safety is secure;
The God of Jacob is for us
A refuge strong and sure.

God is our song, and every singer blest
who, giving praise, finds energy and rest.
All who praise God with unaffected joy
give back to us the blessing we destroy.
God is our song, for Jesus comes to save;
while praising him, we offer all we have.
New songs we sing, in ventures new unite,
when Jesus leads us upward into light.
This is the song no conflict ever drowns;
who praises God all human wrath disowns.
Love knows what rich complexities of sound
God builds upon a simple, common ground.
God is our silence when no songs are sung,
when ecstasy or sorrow still the tongue.
Glorious the faith which silently obeys
until we find again the voice of praise.

God is so good
God is so good
God is so good
He’s so good to me 
(Ladies) He answers prayer
He answers prayer
He answers prayer
He’s so good to me
(Men) I love Him so
I love Him so
I love Him so
He’s so good to me
(All) We praise His name
We praise His name
We praise His name
He’s so good to me

Have you started for glory and Heaven?
Have you left this old world far behind?
In your heart is the Comforter dwelling?
Can you say, “Praise the Lord, He is mine"?
Have the ones that once walked on the highway
Gone back, and you seem all alone?
Keep your eyes on the prize, for the home in the skies;
God is still on the throne.
God is still on the throne,
And He will remember His own;
Tho’ trials may press us and burdens distress us,
He never will leave us alone;
God is still on the throne,
He never forsaketh His own;
His promise is true, He will not forget you,
God is still on the throne.
Burdened soul, is your heart growing weary
With the toil and the heat of the day?
Does it seem that your path is more thorny
As you journey along on life’s way?
Go away and in secret before Him
Tell your grief to the Savior alone;
He will lighten your care, for He still answers prayer;
God is still on the throne.
You may live in a tent or a cottage,
Unnoticed by those who pass by;
But a mansion for you He is building
In that beautiful city on high;
It will outshine the wealth and the splendor
Of the richest on earth we have known;
He’s the Architect true, and He’s building for you;
God is still on the throne.
He is coming again, is the promise
To disciples when He went away;
In like manner as He has gone from you,
You will see Him returning some day;
Does His tarrying cause you to wonder,
Does it seem He’s forgotten His own?
His promise is true, He is coming for you;
God is still on the throne.

God is the fountain whence
[originally, Love is the fountain whence]
Ten thousand blessings flow;
To Him my life, my health, and friends,
And every good, I owe.
The comforts He affords
Are neither few nor small;
He is the source of fresh delights,
My portion and my all.
He fills my heart with joy,
My lips attunes for praise;
And to His glory I’ll devote
The remnant of my days.

God is the Name my 
soul adores,
The almighty Three, 
the eternal One;
Nature and grace, 
with all their 
powers,
Confess the Infinite 
Unknown.

God is the refuge of His saints,
When storms of sharp distress invade;
Ere we can offer our complaints,
Behold Him present with His aid.
Let mountains from their seats be hurled
Down to the deep, and buried there;
Convulsions shake the solid world:
Our faith shall never yield to fear.
Loud may the troubled ocean roar;
In sacred peace our souls abide;
While every nation, every shore,
Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.
There is a stream, whose gentle flow
Supplies the city of our God,
Life, love, and joy, still guiding through,
And wat’ring our divine abode.
That sacred stream—Thy holy Word—
That all our raging fear controls;
Sweet peace Thy promises afford,
And give new strength to fainting souls.
Zion enjoys her Monarch’s love,
Secure against a threatening hour;
Nor can her firm foundations move,
Built on His truth, and armed with power.

Who have I in heaven, but You
There is nothing on earth I desire
Besides You
My heart and my strength
Many times they fail
But there is one truth
That always will prevail.
God is the strength of my heart!
God is the strength of my heart!
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion, forever!

What tho' no flow'rs the fig-tree clothe,
Tho' vines their fruit deny,
The labor of the olive fail,
And fields no meat supply?
Tho' from the fold, with sad surprise,
My flock cut off I see;
Tho' famine pine in empty stalls,
Where herds were wont to be?
Yet in the Lord will I be glad,
And glory in his love:
In him I'll joy, who will the God
Of my salvation prove.
He to my tardy feet shall lend
The swiftness of the roe;
Till, raised on high, I safely dwell
Beyond the reach of woe.
God is the treasure of my soul,
The source of lasting joy;
A joy which want shall not impair,
Nor death itself destroy.

God is there
We don't know, we can't see
We may hurt, we may bleed
All alone (All alone), not likely (Not likely)
Does He love, are we free?
Sometimes these questions seem wrong
Through our faith (Through our faith), we stay strong (We stay strong)
God is there (God is there, God is there)
He's the only One who truly cares (He cares, He gives hope)
He gives love (He gives hope, He gives love)
He offers strength from above
God is there, God is there
We die old, we die young
Time will tell what's been done
Can it be (Can it be) that He lives (That He lives)?
That He loves, that He gives
That He gave His own Son
To show us (To show us) the victory's won (Victory's won)
God is there
Hmmmm

God is with us, God is with us,
So our brave forefathers sang,
Far across the field of battle
Loud their holy war cry rang;
Though at times they feared and faltered,
Never once they ceased to sing:
God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King!
Great the heritage they left us,
Great the conquests to be won,
Armed hosts to meet and scatter,
Larger duties to be done.
Raise the song they nobly taught us,
Round the wide world let it ring:
God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King!
Speed the cross through all the nations,
Speed the victories of love,
Preach the Gospel of redemption
Wheresoever men may move;
Make the future in the present,
Strong of heart, toil on and sing:
God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King!

God is working His purpose out
As year succeeds to year;
God is working his purpose out,
And the time is drawing near;
Nearer and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
From utmost east to utmost west,
Where’er man’s foot hath trod,
By the mouth of many messengers
Goes forth the voice of God:
“Give ear to Me, ye continents,
Ye isles, give ear to Me,"
That the earth may be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
What can we do to work God’s work,
To prosper and increase
The brotherhood of all mankind,
The reign of the Prince of Peace?
What can we do to hasten the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
March we forth in the strength of God,
With the banner of Christ unfurled,
That the light of the glorious Gospel of truth
May shine throughout the world;
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin
To set their captives free,
That the earth may be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
All we can do is nothing worth
Unless God blesses the deed;
Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide
Till God gives life to the seed;
Yet near and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

God, keep me safe; in You I refuge take.
You are my Lord; I have no good elsewhere.
The hearts of all idolaters will ache;
In all their sacrifices I’ll not share.
Lord, my inheritance You have assigned;
You guard what’s mine and make me feel secure.
Your boundary lines are pleasant to my mind;
Your future blessings will bring joy for sure.
Lord, I will praise You for Your counsel wise;
Even at night my heart tells me Your way.
I’ll always set You first before my eyes;
You’re right beside me; I won’t be afraid.
My heart is glad; my tongue rejoices e’er;
I know You will not leave me when I die.
The path of life to me You will declare;
You’ll fill me with eternal joy on high.

If you should feel sad and dejected,
When no answer comes to your prayers,
And when it seems you are neglected,
Remember, God knows and He cares.
He knows and He cares,
Your burden He bears;
He drank the whole cup,
While we take but one sup,
Your suff’ring He shares.
And when you get weary with toiling,
When no one your sore burden shares,
When evils your efforts are foiling,
Remember, God knows and He cares.
When confidence has become shaken,
You give Satan place unawares,
The Lord will not leave you forsaken,
He sees you, He knows and He cares.
When feelings of joy have subsided,
When sickness your health so impairs,
Don’t fail in your trust, be decided;
God sees you and tests you, He cares.
See Christ in your furnace of trial,
“I’m with you alway," He declares;
When suff’ring severe self-denial,
Remember, He knows and He cares.

In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water’s cool flow bathes the weary one’s feet,
God leads His dear children along.
Some through the waters, some through the flood,
Some through the fire, but all through the blood;
Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,
In the night season and all the day long.
Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.
Though sorrows befall us and evils oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.
Away from the mire, and away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity’s day,
God leads His dear children along.

God, Lord of Sabaoth, Thou who ordainest
Thunder Thy clarion and lightning Thy sword,
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.
God, the omnipotent, mighty Avenger,
Watching invisible, judging unheard;
Save us in mercy, oh, save us from danger;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.
God, the All-merciful, earth hath forsaken
Thy ways all holy and slighted Thy Word;
Let not Thy wrath in its terror awaken;
Give to us pardon and peace, O Lord.
So shall Thy people, with thankful devotion,
Praise Him who saved them from peril and sword,
Singing in , from ocean to ocean,
Peace to the nations and praise to the Lord.

God loved the world of sinners lost,
And ruined by the fall;
Salvation full, at highest cost,
He offers free to all.
O ’twas love, ’twas wondrous love,
The love of God to me;
It brought my Savior from above,
To die on Calvary!
E’en now by faith I claim Him mine,
The risen Son of God;
Redemption by His death I find,
And cleansing through the blood.
Love brings the glorious fullness in,
And to His saints makes known
The blessed rest from inbred sin,
Through faith in Christ alone.
Believing souls, rejoicing go;
There shall to you be giv’n
A glorious foretaste, here below,
Of endless life in Heav’n.
Of victory now o’er Satan’s power
Let all the ransomed sing,
And triumph in the dying hour
Through Christ, the Lord, our King.

God loved the world so that He gave
His only Son the lost to save
That all who would in Him believe
Should everlasting life receive.
Christ Jesus is the Ground of faith,
Who was made flesh and suffered death;
All that confide in Him alone
Are built on this chief Cornerstone.
God would not have the sinner die,
His Son with saving grace is nigh,
His Spirit in the Word doth teach
How man the blessed goal may reach.
Be of good cheer, for God’s own Son
Forgives all sins which thou hast done,
And, justified by Jesus’ blood,
Thy baptism grants the highest good.
If thou be sick, if death draw near
This truth thy troubled heart can cheer:
Christ Jesus saves my soul from death;
That is the firmest ground of faith.
Glory to God the Father, Son,
And Holy Spirit, Three in One!
To Thee, O blessed Trinity,
Be praise now and eternally!

Do you ever wonder
'Bout the purpose for your life?
Should I be content to know
That I am someone's wife?
Sometimes it feels that I
Just might have been left out
But when I read the Word of God
I lose all of my doubt 
I see that Lydia was a merchant
Who took good care of Paul
Priscilla was Italian
With a missionary call
Deborah was a prophet
And a judge of all the land
And Mary raised the Son of God
And now I understand
I know that 
God loves women
We're part of the plan he made
Part of his theology
God loves women
The perfect companion
'Cause that's what we're meant to be
God loves women
How can you question?
Just take a look at history
God loves women
He'll never abandon
I know He'll make a path for me 
God can do all things
That's one thing I know
But all those women lived
Several thousand years ago
It makes me wonder
If He'll use me just the same
But everything is possible
When done in Jesus' name 
Remember Tabitha had passed away
Till peter said "arise"
And Rahab had a faith in God
And hid the Jewish spies
Esther saved the Israelites
And Phoebe served God well
And Sarah lived a century
Before the Lord prevailed 
I know that God has blessed me
So much more than just a wife
Who else could take a seed
And give the miracle of life? 
God loves women (oh yes He does)
We're part of the plan he made
Part of his theology
God loves women (and so do we)
The perfect companion
'Cause that's what we're meant to be
God loves women (you better believe)
How can you question?
Just take a look at history
God loves women (well don't you know)
God loves women 

God loveth the righteous, His goodness is sure.
He never forsaketh the good and the pure.
Yet once my faith faltered, I envied the proud,
In doubt and disquiet my spirit was bowed.
The wicked are prosperous and firm in their strength,
No pangs do they suffer, though death come at length.
They are not in trouble as other men are,
The plagues of their fellows they view from afar.
In garments of boasting and violence decked,
With wealth more abundant than heart could expect,
They scoff, and the helpless they proudly oppress.
The heavens and the earth they assume to possess.
Despising God’s people, they cause them to drain
The cup of oppression, injustice and pain.
They question God’s knowledge and boldly defy
The might and the justice of God the Most High.
The wicked, grown wealthy, have comfort and peace,
While I, daily chastened, see troubles increase,
And, wronging God’s children, I cried in my pain,
That clean hands are worthless and pure hearts are vain.
I went to God’s temple: my doubts were dispelled.
The end of life’s journey I clearly beheld.
I saw in what peril ungodly men stand,
With sudden destruction and ruin at hand.
As when one waking forgetteth his dream,
So God will despise them, though great they may seem.
My envy was senseless; my grief was for naught.
Because I was faithless, and foolish my thought.

This wanton world in grossest error
Is hast’ning toward the judgment morning;
’Twill meet the Judge in deepest terror,
For, blinded, it despised His warning.
1-3:
God made a way, He sent salvation
To make of man a new creation,
To lay, in Christ, a firm foundation;
Oh, what a wondrous transformation! 
How can a soul, black and polluted,
Meet such requirements so exalted?
Where sin has e’er reigned undisputed,
What hope is there it can be halted? 
I was a helpless, lost offender,
Enslaved to every inner craving,
And, void of sight, could not surrender,
And sin’s black filth kept on engraving.
But God in mercy gave me vision,
And there I saw my true condition;
Yes, there I made the great decision:
Before the throne I made petition.
God made a way, He sent a Savior—
A heart washed white, in spotless glory,
A path that frees from misbehavior
To heaven’s gate—oh, wondrous story! 

God made birds to fill the skies
Bumblebees and butterflies
God made man
God made man to praise the Lord 
God made fish to fill the seas
Dolphins, whales, and manatees
God made man
God made man to praise the Lord 
God made the sun to give us light
Moon and stars to light the night
God made man
God made man to praise the Lord 
God make flowers to dress the hills
Marigolds and daffodils
God made man
God made man to praise the Lord 
God made cows for pastures green
Horses, goats and fuzzy sheep
God made man
God made man to praise the Lord 

God made me for Himself, to serve Him here
With love’s pure service and in filial fear;
To show His praise, for Him to labor now;
Then see His glory where the angels bow.
All needful grace was mine, through His dear Son,
Whose life and death my full salvation won;
The grace that would have strengthened me, and taught;
Grace that would crown me when my work was wrought.
And I, poor sinner, cast it all away;
Lived for the toil or pleasure of each day;
As if no Christ had shed His precious blood,
As if I owed no homage to my God.
O Holy Spirit, with Thy fire divine,
Melt into tears this thankless heart of mine;
Teach me to love what once I seemed to hate,
And live to God, before it be too late.

God made you, God made me
To work together in harmony
Some parts are big, others small
But to the Lord it doesn't matter at all
But to the Lord it doesn't matter at all
We're diff'rent colors, sizes and shapes
Diff'rent years, models and makes
Diff'rent gifts, talents and strengths
Serving the Lord as one,
Building His Body in love (Yes!)
God made you, God made me
To work together in harmony
Some parts are big, others small
But to the Lord it doesn't matter at all
But to the Lord, but to the Lord
But to the Lord it doesn't matter at all

God make my life a little light
Within the world to glow;
A little flame that burneth bright,
Wherever I may go.
God make my life a little flower
That giveth joy to all,
Content to bloom in native bower,
Although the place be small.
God make my life a little song
That comforteth the sad
That helpeth others to be strong,
And makes the singer glad.
God make my life a little staff
Whereon the weak may rest,
That so what health and strength I have
May serve my neighbors best.
God make my life a little hymn
Of tenderness and praise,
Of faith, that never waxeth dim,
In all His wondrous ways.

God makes a path, provides a guide,
And feeds in wilderness;
His glorious Name, while breath remains,
O that I may confess.
Lost many a time, I had no guide,
No house but hollow tree;
In stormy winter night, no fire,
No food, no company.
In Him I found a house, a bed,
A table, company;
No cup so bitter but made sweet,
Where God shall sweetening be.

God Most High, we praise You, honor, and exalt You.
You Who live forever, to You our song we raise.
Oh, how great Your signs, Lord; mighty are Your wonders.
Eternal ruler, worthy of all praise!
Your enduring kingdom lasts for generations.
Your dominion is eternal, and You rule all men.
You alone are living; You endure forever.
Your kingdom, Lord, will never have an end.
All earth’s many peoples You regard as nothing.
You do as You please in Heaven and on earth below.
None can overpower You; none can hold Your hand back.
None dares to ask You why You acted so.
King of Heav’n, we praise You, glorify, exalt You.
Everything You do is right, and all Your ways are just.
All the proud and boastful You can quickly humble.
We bow before You; Lord, in You we trust.

God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea
And rides upon the storm.
Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never failing skill
He treasures up His bright designs
And works His sovereign will.
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy and shall break
In blessings on your head.
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.
Blind unbelief is sure to err
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain.

God, my King, Thy might confessing,
Ever will I bless Thy Name;
Day by day Thy throne addressing,
Still will I Thy praise proclaim.
Honor great our God befitteth;
Who His majesty can reach?
Age to age His works transmitteth,
Age to age His power shall teach.
They shall talk of all Thy glory,
On Thy might and greatness dwell,
Speak of Thy dread acts the story,
And Thy deeds of wonder tell.
Nor shall fail from memory’s treasure
Works by love and mercy wrought;
Works of love surpassing measure,
Works of mercy passing thought.
Full of kindness and compassion,
Slow to anger, vast in love,
God is good to all creation;
All His works His goodness prove.
All Thy works, O Lord, shall bless Thee;
Thee shall all Thy saints adore:
King supreme shall they confess Thee,
And proclaim Thy sovereign power.

The God of Abraham praise, Who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days, and God of Love;
Jehovah, great I AM! by earth and Heav’n confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred Name forever blessed.
The God of Abraham praise, at Whose supreme command
From earth I rise—and seek the joys at His right hand;
I all on earth forsake, its wisdom, fame, and power;
And Him my only Portion make, my Shield and Tower.
The God of Abraham praise, Whose all sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days, in all my ways.
He calls a worm His friend, He calls Himself my God!
And He shall save me to the end, thro’ Jesus’ blood.
He by Himself has sworn; I on His oath depend,
I shall, on eagle wings upborne, to Heav’n ascend.
I shall behold His face; I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace forevermore.
Tho’ nature’s strength decay, and earth and hell withstand,
To Canaan’s bounds I urge my way, at His command.
The wat’ry deep I pass, with Jesus in my view;
And thro’ the howling wilderness my way pursue.
The goodly land I see, with peace and plenty bless’d;
A land of sacred liberty, and endless rest.
There milk and honey flow, and oil and wine abound,
And trees of life forever grow with mercy crowned.
There dwells the Lord our King, the Lord our righteousness,
Triumphant o’er the world and sin, the Prince of peace;
On Sion’s sacred height His kingdom still maintains,
And glorious with His saints in light forever reigns.
He keeps His own secure, He guards them by His side,
Arrays in garments, white and pure, His spotless bride:
With streams of sacred bliss, with groves of living joys—
With all the fruits of Paradise, He still supplies.
Before the great Three-One they all exulting stand;
And tell the wonders He hath done, through all their land:
The list’ning spheres attend, and swell the growing fame;
And sing, in songs which never end, the wondrous Name.
The God Who reigns on high the great archangels sing,
And “Holy, holy, holy!" cry, “Almighty King!
Who was, and is, the same, and evermore shall be:
Jehovah—Father—great I AM, we worship Thee!"
Before the Savior’s face the ransomed nations bow;
O’erwhelmed at His almighty grace, forever new:
He shows His prints of love—they kindle to a flame!
And sound thro’ all the worlds above the slaughtered Lamb.
The whole triumphant host give thanks to God on high;
“Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," they ever cry.
Hail, Abraham’s God, and mine! (I join the heav’nly lays,)
All might and majesty are Thine, and endless praise.

God of all grace, Thy mercy send;
Let Thy protecting arm defend;
Save us and keep us to the end:
Have mercy, Lord.
And through the coming hours of night,
Fill us, we pray, with holy light;
Keep us all sinless in Thy sight:
Grant this, O Lord.
May some bright messenger abide
For ever by Thy servants’ side,
A faithful guardian and our guide:
Grant this, O Lord.
From every sin in mercy free,
Let heart and conscience stainless be;
That we may live henceforth for Thee:
Grant this, O Lord.
We would not be by care opprest;
But in Thy love and wisdom rest;
Give what Thou seest to be best:
Grant this, O Lord.
While we of every sin repent,
Let our remaining years be spent
In holiness and sweet content:
Grant this, O Lord.
And when the end of life is near,
May we, unshamed and void of fear,
Wait for the judgment to appear:
Grant this, O Lord.

God of all power, and truth, and grace,
Which shall from age to age endure,
Whose Word, when Heaven and earth shall pass,
Remains and stands for ever sure;
That I Thy mercy may proclaim,
That all mankind Thy truth may see,
Hallow Thy great and glorious Name,
And perfect holiness in me.
Thy sanctifying Spirit pour,
To quench my thirst, and make me clean;
Now, Father, let the gracious shower
Descend, and make me pure from sin.
Purge me from every sinful blot;
My idols all be cast aside;
Cleanse me from every sinful thought,
From all the filth of self and pride.
Give me a new, a perfect heart,
From doubt, and fear, and sorrow free;
The mind which was in Christ impart,
And let my spirit cleave to Thee.
O take this heart of stone away!
Thy sway it doth not, cannot own;
In me no longer let it stay,
O take away this heart of stone!
O that I now, from sin released,
Thy Word may to the utmost prove,
Enter into the promised rest,
The Canaan of Thy perfect love!

God of all-redeeming grace,
By thy pardoning love compelled,
Up to thee our souls we raise,
Up to thee our bodies yield:
Thou our sacrifice receive,
Acceptable through thy Son,
While to thee alone we live,
While we die to thee alone.
Meet it is, and just, and right,
That we should be wholly thine,
In thine only will delight,
In thy blessed service join:
O that every work and word
Might proclaim how good thou art,
"Holiness unto the Lord"
Still be written on our heart!

God of all splendor, wonder and might
Awesome creator, Author of life
Master and Savior, wholly divine
God of all splendor, wonder and might
Who is like you, oh Lord
Worthy of all praise
Who is like you, oh Lord
Let all the earth proclaim
Your kingdom forever
Love shining bright
God of all splendor
Wonder and might
God of all splendor, wonder and might
Essence of beauty and all that is right
King of all glory, heaven's pure light
God of all splendor, wonder and might

God of all time, all seasons of our living,
source of our spark, protector of our flame,
blazing before our birth, beyond our dying--
God of all time, we come to sing your name.
Here in this place, where others have been building,
we come to claim the legacy of faith;
take, in our turn, the telling of your story;
and, though we tremble, speak your hope, your truth.
Spirit, who draws our fragile selves together;
Spirit, who turns a stranger to a friend:
be at the table where we greet each other;
be in the peace we pass from hand to hand.
Let us not die from poverty of caring;
let us not starve, where love is to be shared.
Come, break us open to receive your healing;
your broken body be our wine and bread.

God of compassion, in mercy befriend us;
Giver of grace for our needs all availing;
Wisdom and strength for each day do Thou send us,
Patience untiring and courage unfailing.
Wandering and lost, Thou hast sought us and found us,
Stilled our rude hearts with Thy Word consoling,
Wrap now Thy peace, like a mantle, around us,
Guarding our thoughts and our passions controlling.
How shall we stray, with Thy hand to direct us,
Thou Who the stars in their courses art guiding?
What shall we fear, with Thy power to protect us,
We who walk forth in Thy greatness confiding?

God of the earth, the sky, the sea!
Maker of all above, below!
Creation lives and moves in Thee,
Thy present life in all doth flow.
We give Thee thanks, Thy Name we sing,
Almighty Father, heavenly King.
Thy love is in the sunshine’s glow,
Thy life is in the quickening air;
When lightning flashes and storm winds blow,
There is Thy power; Thy law is there.
We feel Thy calm at evening’s hour,
Thy grandeur in the march of night;
And when Thy morning breaks in power,
We hear Thy Word, “Let there be light."
But higher far, and far more clear,
Thee in man’s spirit we behold;
Thine image and Thyself are there—
Th’indwelling God, proclaimed of old.

God of freedom, God of justice,
God whose love is strong as death,
God who saw the dark of prison,
God who knew the price of faith:
touch our world of sad oppression
with your Spirit's healing breath.
Rid the earth of torture's terror,
God whose hands were nailed to wood;
hear the cries of pain and protest,
God who shed the tears and blood;
move in us the power of pity,
restless for the common good.
Make in us a captive conscience
quick to hear, to act, to plead;
make us truly sisters, brothers,
of whatever race or creed:
teach us to be fully human,
open to each other's need.

God of grace and God of glory,
On Thy people pour Thy power.
Crown Thine ancient church’s story,
Bring her bud to glorious flower.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
For the facing of this hour,
For the facing of this hour.
Lo! the hosts of evil ’round us,
Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways.
From the fears that long have bound us,
Free our hearts to faith and praise.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
For the living of these days,
For the living of these days.
Cure Thy children’s warring madness,
Bend our pride to Thy control.
Shame our wanton selfish gladness,
Rich in things and poor in soul.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.
Set our feet on lofty places,
Gird our lives that they may be,
Armored with all Christ-like graces,
In the fight to set men free.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
That we fail not man nor Thee,
That we fail not man nor Thee.
Save us from weak resignation,
To the evils we deplore.
Let the search for Thy salvation,
Be our glory evermore.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
Serving Thee Whom we adore,
Serving Thee Whom we adore.

God of grace, O let Thy light
Bless our dim and blinded sight;
Like the day-spring on the night,
Bid Thy grace to shine.
To the nations led astray
Thine eternal love display:
Let Thy truth direct their way
Till the world be Thine.
Praise to Thee, the faithful Lord;
Let all tongues in glad accord
Learn the good thanksgiving word,
Ever praising Thee.
Let them moved to gladness sing,
Owning Thee their Judge and King;
Righteous truth shall bloom and spring
Where Thy rule shall be.
Praise to Thee, all faithful Lord;
Let all tongues in glad accord
Speak the good thanksgiving word,
Heart rejoicing praise.
So the fruitful earth’s increase,
Bounty of the God of peace,
Never in its course shall cease
Through the length of days;
While His grace our life shall cheer,
Furthest lands shall own His fear,
Brought to Him in worship near,
Taught His mercy’s ways.

The God of holiness and love,
His faithfulness I see above,
Though I am prone to sin;
But triumphing with His strong hand,
I know with me He’ll ever stand,
Till I reach Beulah Land.
Oh, Jesus’ light and boundless grace!
How blest was I to see His face,
His life He did not spare;
This sinner He in love did seek,
Enabling me His Word to speak,
I walk as child and heir.
Yes, Jesus died upon the cross,
To some it seems but pain and loss,
But He the Lord obeyed;
The Potter setting free His clay,
To live above in endless day,
With love that cannot fade.
In that celestial home I’ll see
My brothers, sisters, family,
I long for His reward;
Then Jesus will my soul embrace,
A crown of life my sins replace,
As long as I believe!

God of love and God of power,
Grant us in this burning hour
Grace to ask these gifts of Thee,
Daring hearts and spirits free.
God of love and God of power,
Thou hast called us for this hour.
We are not the first to be
Banished by our fears from Thee;
Give us courage, let us hear
Heaven’s trumpets ringing clear.
All our lives belong to Thee,
Thou our final loyalty;
Slaves are we whene’er we share
That devotion anywhere.
God of love and God of power,
Make us worthy of this hour,
Offering lives if it’s Thy will,
Keeping free our spirits still.

The God of love my Shepherd is,
And He that doth me feed;
While He is mine and I am His,
What can I want or need?
He leads me to the tender grass,
Where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently pass:
In both I have the best.
Or if I stray, He doth convert,
And bring my mind in frame,
And all this not for my desert,
But for His holy Name.
Yea, in death’s shady black abode
Well may I walk, not fear;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
To guard, Thy staff to bear.
Surely Thy sweet and wondrous love
Shall measure all my days;
And as it never shall remove
So neither shall my praise.

God of mercy, God of love,
All Thy wondrous works approve
Thy own goodness, and reveal
What our ransomed spirits feel,
That Thy name, in heav’n above
And in all this world, is love.
God of glory, in us shine,
Soul and body, we are Thine;
God of wisdom, love, and might,
Be our strength and burning light;
God of peace and holiness,
Let Thy beauty be on us.
God, within us be Thy throne;
In the meekness of Thy Son,
Pure and spotless, filled with peace,
We shall rise to see Thy face—
See Thee in Thy majesty,
Blest through all eternity.

God of mercy, God of grace,
show the brightness of thy face.
Shine upon us, Savior, shine,
fill thy Church with light divine,
and thy saving health extend 
unto earth's remotest end.
Let the people praise thee, Lord;
be by all that live adored.
Let the nations shout and sing
glory to their Savior King;
at thy feet their tribute pay,
and thy holy will obey.
Let the people praise thee, Lord;
earth shall then her fruits afford;
God to man his blessing give,
man to God devoted live;
all below, and all above,
one in joy, and light, and love.

God of mercy, God of grace,
Show the brightness of Thy face;
Shine upon us, Savior, shine,
Fill Thy Church with light divine,
And Thy saving health extend,
Unto earth’s remotest end.
Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
Be by all that live adored;
Let the nations shout and sing
Glory to their Savior King,
At Thy feet their tribute pay,
And Thy holy will obey.
Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
Earth shall then her fruits afford,
God to man His blessings give,
Man to God devoted live;
All below and all above
One in joy and light and love.

God of might, God of right,
Thee we give all glory;
Thine all praise in these days
As in ages hoary,
When we hear, year by year,
Freedom’s wondrous story.
Now as erst, when Thou first
Madst the proclamation,
Warning loud every proud,
Every tyrant nation,
We Thy fame still proclaim,
Bend in adoration.
Be with all who in thrall
To their task are driven;
In Thy power speed the hour
When their chains are riven;
Earth around will resound
Gleeful hymns to heaven.

God of my life, through all my days,
My grateful powers shall sound Thy praise;
My song shall wake with opening light,
And cheer the dark and silent night.
When anxious cares would break my rest,
And griefs would tear my throbbing breast,
Thy tuneful praises, raised on high,
Shall check the murmur and the sigh.
When death o’er nature shall prevail,
And all its powers of language fail,
Joy through my swimming eyes shall break,
And mean the thanks I cannot speak.
But O! when that last conflict’s o’er,
And I am chained to earth no more,
With what glad accents shall I rise
To join the music of the skies!
Soon shall I learn the exalted strains
Which echo through the heavenly plains;
And emulate, with joy unknown,
The glowing seraphs round the throne.
The cheerful tribute will I give,
Long as a deathless soul shall live;
A work so sweet, a theme so high,
Demands and crowns eternity.

God of my life, to Thee I call;
Afflicted, at Thy feet I fall;
When the great water floods prevail
Leave not my trembling heart to fail!
Friend of the friendless and the saint,
Where should I lodge my deep complaint?
Where but with Thee, Whose open door
Invites the helpless and the poor!
Did ever mourner plead with Thee,
And Thou refuse that mourner’s plea?
Does not the Word still fixed remain
That none shall seek Thy face in vain?
That were a grief I could not bear,
Didst Thou not hear and answer prayer;
But a prayer hearing, answering God
Supports me under every load.
Fair is the lot that’s cast for me!
I have an Advocate with Thee;
They whom the world caresses most,
Have no such privilege to boast.
Poor thou I am, despised, forgot,
Yet God, my God, forgets me not;
And he is safe, and must succeed,
For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.

God of my salvation, hear,
And help me to believe;
Simply do I now draw near,
Thy blessing to receive:
Full of sin, alas! I am,
But to thy wounds for refuge flee:
Friend of sinners, spotless Lamb,
Thy blood was shed for me.
Standing now as newly slain,
To thee I lift mine eye;
Balm of all my grief and pain,
Thy grace is always nigh:
Now as yesterday the same
Thou art, and wilt for ever be:
Nothing have I, Lord, to pay,
Nor can thy grace procure;
Empty send me not away,
For I, thou know'st, am poor:
Dust and ashes is my name,
My all is sin and misery:
No good word, or work, or thought
Bring I to gain thy grace;
Pardon I accept unbought,
Thine offer I embrace,
Coming, as at first I came,
To take, and not bestow on thee:
Saviour, from thy wounded side
I never will depart;
Here will I my spirit hide
When I am pure in heart:
Till my place above I claim,
This only shall be all my plea:

The God of nature and of grace
In all His works appears;
His goodness through the earth we trace,
His grandeur in the spheres.
Behold this fair and fertile globe,
By Him in wisdom planned:
’Twas He Who girded, like a robe,
The ocean round the land.
Lift to the firmament your eye;
Thither His path pursue;
His glory, boundless in the sky,
O’erwhelms the wondering view.
He bows the heavens—the mountains stand
A highway for their God;
He walks amidst the desert land;
’Tis Eden where He trod.
The forests in His strength rejoice;
Hark! on the evening breeze,
As once of old, the Lord God’s voice
Is heard among the trees.
In every stream His bounty flows,
Diffusing joy and wealth;
In every breeze His Spirit blows,
The breath of life and health.
His blessings fall in plenteous showers
Upon the lap of earth,
That teems with foliage, fruits and flowers,
And rings with infant mirth.
If God hath made this world so fair,
Where sin and death abound,
How beautiful, beyond compare,
Will Paradise be found!

The God of love my Shepherd is,
And He that doth me feed;
While He is mine and I am His,
What can I want or need?
He leads me to the tender grass,
Where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently pass:
In both I have the best.
Or if I stray, He doth convert,
And bring my mind in frame,
And all this not for my desert,
But for His holy Name.
Yea, in death’s shady black abode
Well may I walk, not fear;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
To guard, Thy staff to bear.
Surely Thy sweet and wondrous love
Shall measure all my days;
And as it never shall remove
So neither shall my praise.

God of our fathers, Whose almighty hand
Leads forth in beauty all the starry band
Of shining worlds in splendor through the skies
Our grateful songs before Thy throne arise.
Thy love divine hath led us in the past,
In this free land by Thee our lot is cast,
Be Thou our Ruler, Guardian, Guide and Stay,
Thy Word our law, Thy paths our chosen way.
From war’s alarms, from deadly pestilence,
Be Thy strong arm our ever sure defense;
Thy true religion in our hearts increase,
Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.
Refresh Thy people on their toilsome way,
Lead us from night to never ending day;
Fill all our lives with love and grace divine,
And glory, laud, and praise be ever Thine.

God of our fathers, known of old,
Lord of our far flung battle line,
Beneath whose awful hand we hold
Dominion over palm and pine—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
The tumult and the shouting dies;
The captains and the kings depart:
Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,
An humble and a contrite heart.
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
Far called, our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings as the Gentiles use,
Or lesser breeds without the Law—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
For heathen heart that puts her trust
In reeking tube and iron shard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
And guarding, calls not Thee to guard,
For frantic boast and foolish word—
Thy mercy on Thy people, Lord!

God of our fathers, unto Thee
Our fathers cried in danger’s hour,
And then Thou gavest them to see
The acts of Thine almighty power.
They cried to Thee, and Thou didst hear;
They called on Thee, and Thou didst save;
And we their sons today draw near
Thy Name to praise, Thy help to crave.
Lord God of hosts, uplift Thine hand,
Protect and bless our fatherland.
Thine is the majesty, O Lord,
And Thine dominion over all;
When Thou commandest, at Thy word
Great kings and nations rise or fall.
For eastern realms, for western coasts,
For islands washed by every sea,
The praise be giv’n, O God of hosts,
Not unto us, but unto Thee.
If in Thy grace Thou should’st allow
Our fame to wax through coming days,
Still grant us humbly, then as now,
Thy help to crave, Thy Name to praise.
Not all alike in speech or birth,
Alike we bow before Thy throne;
One fatherland throughout the earth
Our Father’s noble acts we own.

God of our fathers, whose almighty hand
leads forth in beauty all the starry band
of shining worlds in splendor through the skies,
our grateful songs before thy throne arise.
Thy love divine hath led us in the past,
in this free land by thee our lot is cast;
be thou our ruler, guardian, guide, and stay,
thy word our law, thy paths our chosen way.
From war's alarms, from deadly pestilence,
be thy strong arm our ever sure defense;
thy true religion in our hearts increase,
thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.
Refresh thy people on their toilsome way,
lead us from night to never-ending day;
fill all our lives with love and grace divine,
and glory, laud, and praise be ever thine.

God of our fathers, the strength of our people and nation,
Gladly we come to Thy presence with true adoration,
Seeking Thy face, trusting Thy love and Thy grace,
Thou art our health and salvation.
God of all mercy, for pardon and peace we implore Thee,
Humbly confessing our faults and our failures before Thee.
Children of men, falling and rising again,
Still give us grace to adore Thee.
God of the poor and the weak, to our prayer now attending,
Teach us to follow the Master of all men in blending
Worship with deed, praises with service to need,
All men in His Name befriending.
God of all peoples, let justice and peace like a river
Flow through the world until all, in one common endeavor,
Build among men brotherhood’s kingdom, and then
Thine be the glory forever.

God of our life, through all the circling years,
We trust in Thee;
In all the past, through all our hopes and fears,
Thy hand we see.
With each new day, when morning lifts the veil,
We own Thy mercies, Lord, which never fail.
God of the past, our times are in Thy hand;
With us abide.
Lead us by faith to hope’s true promised land;
Be Thou our Guide.
With Thee to bless, the darkness shines as light,
And faith’s fair vision changes into sight.
God of the coming years, through paths unknown
We follow Thee;
When we are strong, Lord, leave us not alone;
Our Refuge be.
Be Thou for us in life our daily Bread,
Our heart’s true Home when all our years have sped.

The God of our salvation hears
The groans of Zion mixed with tears;
Yet when He comes with kind designs,
Through all the way His terror shines.
On Him the race of man depends,
Far as the earth’s remotest ends,
Where the Creator’s Name is known
By nature’s feeble light alone.
Sailors, that travel o’er the flood,
Address their frighted souls to God,
When tempests rage and billows roar
At dreadful distance from the shore.
He bids the noisy tempests cease;
He calms the raging crowd to peace,
When a tumultuous nation raves
Wild as the winds, and loud as waves.
Whole kingdoms, shaken by the storm,
He settles in a peaceful form;
Mountains, established by His hand,
Firm on their old foundations stand.
Behold His ensigns sweep the sky,
New comets blaze, and lightnings fly;
The heathen lands, with swift surprise,
From the bright horrors turn their eyes.
At His command the morning ray
Smiles in the east, and leads the day;
He guides the sun’s declining wheels
Over the tops of western hills.
Seasons and times obey His voice;
The evening and the morn rejoice
To see the earth made soft with showers,
Laden with fruit, and dressed in flowers.
’Tis from His watery stores on high
He gives the thirsty ground supply;
He walks upon the clouds, and thence
Doth His enriching drops dispense.
The desert grows a fruitful field,
Abundant food the valleys yield;
The valleys shout with cheerful voice,
And neighboring hills 
The pastures smile in green array;
There lambs and larger cattle play;
The larger cattle and the lamb
Each in His language speaks Thy Name.
Thy works pronounce Thy power divine;
O’er every field Thy glories shine;
Through every month Thy gifts appear;
Great God, Thy goodness crowns the year!

God of our sires that joyful sang,
While forest shades triumphant rang,
When on the wild New England shore,
Their sails were furled, their voyage o’er.
O Lord, defend Thy children yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend Thy children yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.
God of the brave that sought Thy aid,
And in Thy robe of strength arrayed,
They won for us beneath Thy care,
The flag we prize, the peace we share,
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.
And when the call to arms again
Was heard afar o’er hill and plain,
Thy mighty hand upheld the right,
Thy love restored Thy banner bright,
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.
God of our land, Thy gift so free,
O hear the prayer we breathe to Thee;
Let union’s bond our souls entwine,
And guard alike the palm and pine.
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget;
O Lord, defend our nation yet,
Nor let our hearts Thy Name forget.
The pastures smile in green array;
There lambs and larger cattle play;
The larger cattle and the lamb
Each in His language speaks Thy Name.
Thy works pronounce Thy power divine;
O’er every field Thy glories shine;
Through every month Thy gifts appear;
Great God, Thy goodness crowns the year!

God of our strength, enthroned above,
The source of life, the fount of love;
O let devotion’s sacred flame
Our souls awake to praise Thy Name.
God of our strength, we wait on Thee,
Our sure defense forever be.
To Thee we lift our joyful eyes,
To Thee on wings of faith we rise;
Come Thou, and let Thy courts on earth
Ring out Thy praise in holy mirth.
God of our strength, from day to day
Direct our thoughts and guide our way;
O may our hearts united be
In sweet communion, Lord, with Thee.
God of our strength, on Thee we call;
God of our hope, our light, our all,
Thy Name we praise, Thy love adore,
Our Rock, our Shield, forevermore.

God of our youth, to Whom we yield
The tribute of our eager praise,
Upon the well contested field,
And mid the glory of these days,
God of our youth, be with us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget.
Sturdy of limb, with bounding health,
Eager to play the hero’s part,
Grant to us each that greater wealth,
An undefiled and loyal heart,
God of our youth, be Thou our might,
To do the right, to do the right.
When from the field of mimic strife,
Of strength with strength, and speed with speed,
We face the sterner fights of life,
As then our strength in time of need,
God of our youth, inspire us still,
To do Thy will, to do Thy will.

God of pity, God of grace,
When we humbly seek Thy face,
Bend from Heav’n, Thy dwelling place;
Hear, forgive, and save.
When we in Thy temple meet,
Spread our wants before Thy feet,
Pleading at Thy mercy seat,
Look from Heav’n and save.
When Thy love our hearts shall fill,
And we long to do Thy will,
Turning to Thy holy hill,
Lord, accept and save.
Should we wander from Thy fold,
And our love to Thee grow cold,
With a pitying eye behold;
Lord, forgive and save.
Should the hand of sorrow press,
Earthly care and want distress,
May our souls Thy peace possess;
Jesus, hear and save.
And, whate’er our cry may be,
When we lift our hearts to Thee,
From our burden set us free;
Hear, forgive, and save.

God of saints, to whom the number
of the starry host is known:
many saints by earth forgotten
live for ever round your throne.
In the roll of your apostles 
stands the name Bartholomew,
for this faithful saint we offer,
year by year, our thanks to you.
All his faith and prayer and patience,
all his toiling and his strife,
all are veiled from us, but written
in the Lamb's great book of life.
There are named the blessed faithful
of the new Jerusalem.
When Christ comes again in glory,
number us, we pray, with them.

God of the changing year, Whose arm of power
In safety leads through danger’s darkest hour,
Here in Thy temple bow Thy children down,
To bless Thy mercy and Thy might to own.
Thine are the beams that cheer us on our way,
And pour around the gladdening light of day;
Thine is the night, and the fair orbs that shine
To cheer its hours of darkness; all are Thine.
If round our path the thorns of sorrow grew,
And mortal friends were faithless, Thou wast true;
Did sickness shake the frame, or anguish tear
The wounded spirit, Thou was present there.
O lend Thine ear, and lift our voice to Thee;
Where’er we dwell, still let Thy mercy be;
From year to year still nearer to Thy shrine
Draw our frail hearts, and make them wholly Thine.

God of the covenant, Triune Jehovah,
Marvels of mercy adoring we see;
Seekers of souls, in the counsels eternal
Binding Thy lost ones for ever to Thee.
Not now by words bringing death to transgressors,
Grace unto life the new covenant brings,
Jesus our Surety, our Kinsman Redeemer,
Round us the robe of His righteousness flings.
Blessings on blessings through age unending,
Covenant fullness in glorious flood;
Ours is a hope which no mortal can measure,
Brought in by Jesus and sealed in His blood.
God of the covenant-changeless, eternal,
Father, Son, Spirit in blessing agree;
Thine be the glory, our weakness confessing,
Triune Jehovah, we rest upon Thee.

God of the earth, the sky, the sea!
Maker of all above, below!
Creation lives and moves in Thee,
Thy present life in all doth flow.
We give Thee thanks, Thy Name we sing,
Almighty Father, heavenly King.
Thy love is in the sunshine’s glow,
Thy life is in the quickening air;
When lightning flashes and storm winds blow,
There is Thy power; Thy law is there.
We feel Thy calm at evening’s hour,
Thy grandeur in the march of night;
And when Thy morning breaks in power,
We hear Thy Word, “Let there be light."
But higher far, and far more clear,
Thee in man’s spirit we behold;
Thine image and Thyself are there—
Th’indwelling God, proclaimed of old.

God of the glorious sunshine
God of refreshing rain,
Whose voice bids earth awaken
And clothe itself again
With life of richest beauty
In plant, in flower, and tree;
Thou God of light and splendor,
We rise and worship Thee.
God of the hill and mountain,
Of valley and of dale,
Whose finger paints the rainbows,
Thy beauties never fail
To fill our souls with wonder,
And turn our thoughts to Thee;
Thou God of living nature
We stand and worship Thee.
God of the busy daytime,
God of the quiet night,
Whose peace pervades the darkness
And greets us with the light,
Safe with Thy presence near us,
Wherever we may be,
Thou God our great Protector,
We love and worship Thee.
God of the whole creation,
God of all life below,
We seek Thy nearer presence,
Thy grander life to know;
When we Thy heightened splendor
Thy greater glories see,
Thou God of all creation,
We still shall worship Thee.

God of the living, in Whose eyes
Unveiled Thy whole creation lies,
All souls are Thine, we must not say
That those are dead who pass away;
From this our world of flesh set free,
We know them living unto Thee.
Released from earthly toil and strife,
With Thee is hidden still their life;
Thine are their thoughts, their works, their powers,
All Thine, and yet most truly ours;
For well we know, where’er they be,
Our dead are living unto Thee.
Not spilt like water on the ground,
Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,
Not wandering in unknown despair,
Beyond Thy voice, Thine Arm, Thy care;
Not left to lie like fallen tree—
Not dead, but living, unto Thee.
Thy Word is true, Thy will is just;
To Thee we leave them, Lord, in trust;
And bless Thee for the love which gave
Thy Son to fill a human grave;
That none might fear that world to see
Where all are living unto Thee.
O Breather into man of breath,
O Holder of the keys of death,
O Giver of the life within,
Save us from death, the death of sin,
That body, soul, and spirit be
Forever living unto Thee.

God of the morning, at Whose voice
The cheerful sun makes haste to rise,
And like a giant doth rejoice
To run his journey through the skies.
From the fair chambers of the east
The circuit of his race begins,
And, without weariness or rest,
Round the whole earth he flies and shines.
O like the sun may I fulfill
Th’appointed duties of the day,
With ready mind and active will
March on and keep my heav’nly way.
But I shall rove and lose the race,
If God, my Sun, should disappear,
And leave me in this world’s wild maze,
To follow every wand’ring star.
Lord, Thy commands are clean and pure,
Enlight’ning our beclouded eyes;
Thy threat’nings just, Thy promise sure,
Thy Gospel makes the simple wise.
Give me Thy counsel for my guide,
And then receive me to Thy bliss;
All my desires and hopes beside
Are faint and cold compared with this.

God of the nations, Who hast led
Thy children since the world began,
Through doubt and struggle, pain and tears,
Unfolding Thy eternal plan;
From countless hilltops as of old
The fire upon the altar flares;
Through countless rites, in countless tongues,
Men offer their imperfect prayers;
Hasten the time of our release,
Bring in Thy reign of truth and peace.
O Jesus Christ, incarnate Son,
Who bore our flesh that men might see
The vision of the perfect life
Fashioned in their humanity;
By all Thy words of heavenly truth,
By all Thy deeds of mercy wrought,
By all the passion of Thy cross,
By the redemption Thou hast brought;
Hasten the time of our release,
Bring in Thy reign of truth and peace.
O Holy Spirit, Who dost touch
The prophets with Thy sacred fire
Eternal wisdom to whose light
All seekers after truth aspire;
Behold the warring sons of men,
The helpless by the strong oppressed,
The truth with error still concealed,
The evil grudgingly confessed;
Hasten the time of our release,
Bring in Thy reign of truth and peace.
O God triune, Thy Church today
In penitence before Thee kneels
Mourning her years of slothful ease,
Her deafness to the world’s appeals;
Divided where she should be one,
Enamored of a lesser strife,
Tithing the mint and cumin while
Men perish for the Bread of Life;
Hasten the time of our release,
Bring in Thy reign of truth and peace.
Restore to us the vision, Lord,
Descend with fires of Pentecost;
Our tongues unloose, our hearts inflame,
To preach the Gospel to the lost:
Here at Thy feet our prayer is made,
Here life and wealth we dedicate;
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
Lord, Thy anointing we await;
Hasten the time of our release,
Bring in Thy reign of truth and peace.

God of the nations, hear our call;
Thou Who art Father of us all;
Show us our part in Thy great plan
For the vast brotherhood of man.
In plastic form the nations lie;
For molding unto us they cry;
May we their urgent summons heed
And gladly go to meet their need.
May we, a nation blessed with light,
Be ever truer to the right,
That nations in our life may see
The power which we derive from Thee.
Thus, as Thy kingdom cometh here,
Shall it throughout the world draw near;
And loyalty to country then
Shall reach out to include all men.

God of the nations, near and far,
Ruler of all mankind,
Bless Thou Thy people as they strive
The paths of peace to find.
The clash of arms still shakes the sky,
King battles still with king—
Wild through the frighted air of night
The bloody tocsins ring.
But clearer far the friendly speech
Of scientists and seers,
The wise debate of statesmen and
The shouts of pioneers.
And stronger far the clasped hands
Of labor’s teeming throngs,
Who in a hundred tongues repeat
Their common creeds and songs.
From shore to shore the peoples call
In loud and sweet acclaim,
The gloom of land and sea is lit
With Pentecostal flame.
O Father! from the curse of war
We pray Thee give release,
And speed, O speed the blessed day
Of justice, love and peace!

God of the nations, Who from dawn of days,
Hast led Thy people in their widening ways,
Through Whose deep purpose stranger thousands stand
Here in the borders of our promised land.
Thine ancient might rebuked the Pharaoh’s boast
Thou wast the shield for Israel’s marching host,
And, all the ages through, past crumbling throne
And broken fetter, Thou hast brought Thine own.
Thy hand has led across the hungry sea
The eager peoples flocking to be free,
And, from the breeds of earth, Thy silent sway
Fashions the nation of the broadening day.
Then, for Thy grace to grow in brotherhood,
For hearts aflame to serve Thy destined good,
For faith, and will to win what faith shall see,
God of Thy people, hear us cry to Thee.

God of the prophets! Bless the prophets’ sons,
Elijah’s mantle o’er Elisha cast;
Each age its solemn task may claim but once;
Make each one nobler, stronger, than the last.
Anoint them prophets! Make their ears attent
To Thy divinest speech; their hearts awake
To human need; their lips make eloquent
To gird the right and every evil break.
Anoint them priests! Strong intercessors, they
For pardon, and for charity and peace.
Ah, if with them the world might, now astray,
Find in our Lord from all its woes release!
Anoint them kings; aye, kingly kings, O Lord.
Anoint them with the Spirit of Thy Son.
Theirs not a jeweled crown, a blood stained sword;
Theirs, by sweet love, for Christ a kingdom won.
Make them apostles, heralds of Thy cross,
Forth may they go to tell all realms Thy grace;
Inspired of Thee, may they count all but loss,
And stand at last with joy before Thy face.
O mighty age of prophet kings, return!
O truth, O faith, enrich our urgent time!
Lord Jesus Christ, again with us sojourn;
A weary world awaits Thy reign sublime.

God of the strong, God of the weak,
Lord of all lands and our own land;
Light of all souls, from Thee we seek
Light from Thy light, strength from Thy hand.
In suffering Thou hast made us one,
In mighty burdens one are we:
Teach us that lowliest duty done
Is highest service unto Thee.
Teach us, great Teacher of mankind
The sacrifice that brings Thy balm;
The love, the work that bless and bind;
Teach us Thy majesty, Thy calm.
Teach Thou, and we shall know indeed
The truth divine that maketh free;
And knowing, we may sow the seed
That blossoms through eternity.

God of unexampled grace,
Redeemer of mankind,
Matter of eternal praise
We in thy passion find;
Still our choicest strains we bring,
Still the joyful theme pursue,
Thee the friend of sinners sing,
Whose love is ever new.
Endless scenes of wonder rise
From that mysterious tree,
Crucified before our eyes,
Where we our Maker see;
Jesus, Lord, what hast thou done?
Publish we the death divine,
Stop, and gaze, and fall, and own
Was never love like thine!
Never love nor sorrow was
Like that my Saviour showed:
See him stretched on yonder cross,
And crushed beneath our load!
Now discern the Deity,
Now his heavenly birth declare;
Faith cries out: 'Tis He, 'tis He,
My God, that suffers there!

God omniscient, God all-wise,
With Thy ever-searching eyes,
Look within me, view my heart;
Keep me pure in every part.
God of love, God of light,
Guide my trusting soul aright;
God of wisdom, God of pow’r,
Be Thou with me every hour.
God almighty, God of pow’r,
Be Thou near me every hour;
Grace and glory to me give,
In Thy might within me live.
God unchanging, God so dear,
God afar, and yet so near,
In Thy majesty so fair,
Thou art present everywhere.
God of holiness divine,
Let Thy glory in me shine;
Like Thine image let me be,
Pure as heaven’s crystal sea.
God eternal, God most high,
God of truth, Who cannot lie,
Round about me cast Thy charms,
Underneath me be Thine arms.

Life is easy when you're up on the mountain 
And you've got peace of mind like you've never known.
But then things change and you're down in the valley.
Don't lose faith for you're never alone.
For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
When things go wrong, He'll make it right.
And the God of the good times 
is still God in the bad times.
The God of the day is still God in the night.
You talk of faith when you're up on the mountain.
Oh but the talk comes easy when life's at its best.
But it's down in the valley of trials and temptation 
That's when faith is really put to the test.
For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
When things go wrong, He'll make it right.
And the God of the good times 
is still God in the bad times.
The God of the day is still God in the night.
For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
When things go wrong, He'll make it right.
And the God of the good times 
is still God in the bad times.
The God of the day is still God in the night.
The God of the day is still God in the night.

God only wise, and great, and strong,
Hath made the orbs to run their race:
Knowledge and might to God belong,
Honor, and majesty, and praise.
Jehovah is unchangeable,
His ways and thoughts are not as ours;
He cheers the languid souls that fail;
And quickens all their drooping powers.
Gently He lifts the fallen up,
He gives them faith, and faith’s increase,
Revives their feeble, dying hope,
And fills with love, and joy and peace.
Blasted, the vigor of the young
Shall fade, and suddenly decay;
The bold, and confident and strong,
Shall fear, despair, and die away.
But they who wait upon the Lord
Shall surely find His promise true,
Receive the quickening powerful Word,
And, born of God, their strength renew.
Their willing souls, from sin set free,
Shall swiftly in His statues move,
Shall walk in glorious liberty
Shall fly upon the wings of love.

God, our Father, we adore Thee! We, Thy children, bless Thy Name!
Chosen in the Christ before Thee, we are “holy without blame."
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Abba’s praises we proclaim!
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Abba’s praises we proclaim!
Son Eternal, we adore Thee! Lamb upon the throne on high!
Lamb of God, we bow before Thee, Thou hast brought Thy people nigh!
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Son of God, Who came to die!
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Son of God, Who came to die!
Holy Spirit, we adore Thee! Paraclete and heavenly Guest!
Sent from God and from the Savior, Thou hast led us into rest.
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! By Thy grace forever blessed:
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! By Thy grace forever blessed!
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Three in One! We give Thee praise!
For the riches we inherit, heart and voice to Thee we raise!
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Thee we bless, through endless days!
We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Thee we bless, through endless days!

Come now with joy and singing,
Loud hallelujahs ringing,
Our grateful tribute bringing
To our almighty Friend;
Offering with purest pleasure,
To Him the heart’s full treasure,
Whose love no thought can measure,
Whose praise shall never end.
We sing with exultation,
Lord God of our salvation;
Thou art our sure Foundation,
Our Refuge evermore.
When to this Refuge flying,
Turn sinners, helpless, dying,
On Christ alone relying,
No harm can reach them there;
When floods of grief are dashing,
And waves of sorrow splashing,
Light to the soul comes flashing—
God’s smile through dark despair.
In waking or in sleeping,
Bright days, or nights of weeping,
Our souls are in Thy keeping
While here we wait below;
In Thee alone abiding,
And in Thy love confiding,
Safe when Thy hand is guiding,
We’ll ever gladly go.

God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour,
Was born upon this day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy!
In Bethlehem in Jewry
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn;
The which his mother Mary
Nothing did take in scorn.
From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came,
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same,
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name.
'Fear not,' then said the angel,
'Let nothing you affright;
This day is born a Saviour
Of virtue, power and might,
So frequently to vanquish all
The friends of Satan quite.' 
The shepherds at these tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway
This blessed Babe to find.
But when to Bethlehem they came,
Whereat this Infant lay,
They found him in a manger
Where oxen fed on hay;
His mother Mary, kneeling,
Unto the Lord did pray.
Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace.
The holy tide of Christmas
All others doth efface.

God reveals his presence:
let us now adore him,
and with awe appear before him.
God is in his temple:
all within keep silence,
prostrate lie with deepest reverence.
Him alone,
God we own,
him our God and Savior:
praise his Name for ever.
God reveals his presence:
hear the harps resounding!
See the hosts the throne surrounding!
"Holy, holy, holy,"
hear the hymn ascending,
angels saints, their voices blending!
Bow thine ear
to us here:
hear, O Christ, the praises
that thy Church now raises.
O thou Font of blessing,
purify my spirit,
trusting only in thy merit.
Like the holy angels
who behold thy glory,
may I ceaselessly adore thee.
Let thy will
ever still
rule thy Church terrestrial,
as the hosts celestial.

God save our gracious Queen,
long live our noble Queen,
God save the Queen!
Send her victorious,
happy and glorious,
long to reign over us,
God save the Queen!
Thy choicest gifts in store
on her be pleased to pour,
long may she reign:
may she defend our laws,
and ever give us cause
to sing with heart and voice
God save the Queen!
Nor on this land alone,
but be God's mercies known
from shore to shore:
Lord, make the nations see
that men should brothers be,
and form one family
the wide world o'er.

God saved His people from distress
And led them through the wilderness;
Then mountains trembled in their place,
The heav’ns were bowed before His face.
With copious showers Thou didst assuage
The thirsting of Thy heritage;
Thy congregation dwelt secure;
Thou, God, art gracious to the poor.
With glorious pomp our King and God
Has entered into His abode
With sacred minstrelsy and song,
While maidens with their timbrels throng.
Assemble ye before His face,
All ye that spring from Israel’s race;
Ye chosen tribes with one accord
Come ye, and bless your God, the Lord.

God says whosoever believes on His Son,
Has pardon obtained and a new life begun;
His sins blotted out, not by aught he has done,
But thro’ faith in the Word of God!
His Word is a strong eternal rock,
Unshaken it stands thro’ fiercest shock;
Though Satan and all his hosts may mock,
I have faith in the Word of God!
And God will make righteous and cleanse from all sin
The one who the chiefest of sinners has been;
He sanctifies wholly and justifies him
Who has faith in the Word of God!
O soul without God, without hope, without peace,
Just now come to Him, let your doubtings all cease;
He says He’ll receive you, your joys will increase,
O have faith in the Word of God.

God sees the little sparrow fall,
It meets His tender view;
If God so loves the little birds,
I know He loves me, too.
He loves me, too, He loves me, too,
I know He loves me, too;
Because He loves the little things,
I know He loves me, too.
He paints the lily of the field,
Perfumes each lily bell;
If He so loves the little flow’rs,
I know He loves me well.
God made the little birds and flow’rs,
And all things large and small;
He’ll not forget his little ones,
I know He loves them all.

God send us men whose aim ’twill be,
Not to defend some ancient creed,
But to live out the laws of Christ
In every thought and word and deed.
God send us men alert and quick
His lofty precepts to translate,
Until the laws of Christ become
The laws and habits of the state.
God send us men of steadfast will,
Patient, courageous, strong and true,
With vision clear and mind equipped
His will to learn, his work to do.
God send us men with hearts ablaze,
All truth to love, all wrong to hate;
These are the patriots nations need;
These are the bulwarks of the state.

God sends us the Spirit to befriend and help us.
Re-create and guide us, Spirit-Friend.
Spirit who enlivens, sanctifies, enlightens,
sets us free, is now our Spirit-Friend.
Spirit of our Maker, Spirit-Friend.
Spirit of our Savior, Spirit-Friend.
Spirit of God's people, Spirit-Friend.
Darkened roads are clearer, heavy burdens lighter,
when we're walking with our Spirit-Friend.
Now we need not fear the powers of the darkness.
None can overcome our Spirit-Friend.
Now we are God's people, bonded by God's presence,
agents of God's purpose, Spirit-Friend.
Lead us forward ever, slipping backward never,
to your remade world, our Spirit-Friend.

God sent His mighty pow’r
To this poor, sinful heart,
To keep me ev’ry hour,
And needful grace impart;
And since His Spirit came,
To take supreme control,
The love enkindled flame
Is burning in my soul.
’Tis burning in my soul,
’Tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heav’nly love is burning in my soul,
The Holy Spirit came,
All glory to His Name!
The fire of heav’nly love is burning in my soul.
Before the cross I bow,
Upon the altar lay
A willing off’ring now,
My all from day to day.
My Savior paid the price,
My name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice
The fire from Heaven falls.
No good that I have done,
His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son,
He saves me by His grace.
All glory be to God!
Let hallelujahs roll;
His love is shed abroad,
The fire is in my soul.

Many souls today are burdened
With a load of toil and care,
Burdened down with grief and sorrow,
Which seem more than they could bear.
Look to God, He will not leave you,
He’ll go with you all the way;
Though you pass through tribulation,
God shall wipe all tears away.
Down their cheeks the tears are streaming,
And their hearts are pressed with fears;
There is hope, if they could find it,
God can wipe away all tears.
But there must needs be repentance,
And a turning back to God,
From the paths and deeds of evil,
Where the wand’ring feet have trod.
Come to Him with true confession,
Come with trembling and with fears;
He will never disappoint you,
God will wipe away all tears.

God smiles when He sees His children living in the light
Shining out to the world
He smiles when they make Him happy, doing what is right
For the ones who've not heard 
God smiles (He smiles)
God smiles (He smiles)
God smiles (He smiles)
God smiles (He smiles) 
God calls for the weary souls who travel all alone
With no guidance ahead
He calls with His invitation will you please come home
Is so lovingly said 
God calls (He calls)
God calls (He calls)
God calls (He calls)
God calls and He beckons you to give Him your all
He smiles when a sinner's born again
But sad is His lovely face when those He has made
Fail to make Him a friend 
God cries with a pure compassion hoping He can save
All the prodigal sons
He cries and His heart is heavy giving what He gave
For unfortunate ones 
God cries (He cries)
God cries (He cries)
God cries (He cries)
God cries (He cries) 
But He smiles when He sees His children living in the light
Shining out to the world
He smiles when they make Him happy, doing what is right
For the ones who've not heard 
God smiles (He smiles) (I know He smiles)
God smiles (He smiles) (oh yes, He smiles)
Oh yes, He smiles (He smiles) (I know He smiles)
God smiles (yes He smiles) 

God loved the world so tenderly
His only Son He gave,
That all who on His Name believe
Its wondrous power will save.
For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son,
That whosoever believeth in Him
Should not perish, should not perish;
That whosoever believeth in Him
Should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Oh, love that only God can feel,
And only He can show!
Its height and depth,
Its length and breadth
Nor Heav’n nor earth can know!
Why perish, then, ye ransomed ones?
Why slight the gracious call?
Why turn from Him Whose words proclaim
Eternal life to all?
O Savior, melt these hearts of ours,
And teach us to believe
That whosoever comes to Thee
Shall endless life receive.

God speaks to us in bird and song,
In winds that drift the clouds along,
Above the din and toil of wrong,
A melody of love.
God speaks to us in far and near,
In peace of home and friends most dear,
From the dim past and present clear,
A melody of love.
God speaks to us in darkest night,
By quiet ways through mornings bright,
When shadows fall with evening light,
A melody of love.
O Voice divine, speak Thou to me,
Beyond the earth, beyond the sea,
First let me hear, then sing to Thee,
A melody of love.

God, that madest earth and Heaven, darkness and light;
Who the day for toil hast given, for rest the night;
May Thine angel guards defend us,
Slumber sweet Thy mercy send us;
Holy dreams and hopes attend us, all through the night.
And when morn again shall call us, to run life’s way,
May we still, whatever befall us, Thy will obey.
From the power of evil hide us,
In the narrow pathway guide us,
Nor Thy smile be ever denied us all through the day.
Guard us waking, guard us sleeping, and when we die,
May we in Thy mighty keeping all peaceful lie;
When the last dread call shall wake us,
Do not Thou, our God, forsake us,
But to reign in glory take us with Thee on high.

God the all-terrible! King, who ordainest
Great winds thy clarions, the lightnings thy sword,
Show forth thy pity on high where thou reignest:
Grant to us peace, O most merciful Lord.
God the omnipotent! mighty avenger,
Watching invisible, judging unheard,
Doom us not now in the day our our danger:
Grant to us peace, O most merciful Lord.
God the all-merciful! earth has forsaken
Thy ways of blessedness, slighted thy word;
Bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken:
Grant to us peace, O most merciful Lord.
So shall thy children in thankful devotion
Praise him who saved them from peril and sword,
Singing in from ocean to ocean,
'Peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord.'

God, the blessed and only Ruler,
Rule my heart today.
You’re the King of kings forever;
O’er my life hold sway.
Lord of lords, be now my Master;
Gladly I’ll obey.
You’re immortal and eternal;
Hear my prayer today.
Lord, You live in light so brilliant,
None can see Your face.
Shine Your light within my heart now;
Cleanse me by Your grace.
Lord, to You be honor, glory,
Now and without end;
May Your mighty power control
My life each day.

Shelter us with angel’s wing,
To our souls Thy pardon bring;
So shall death have lost its sting:
Hear us, holy Jesu.
In the gloom Thy light provide;
Safely through the valley guide;
Thee we trust, for Thou hast died;
Hear us, holy Jesu.
When Thy summons we obey
On the dreadful Judgment Day,
Let not fear our souls dismay:
Hear us, holy Jesu.
While the lost in terror fly,
May we see with joyful eye
Our redemption drawing nigh:

All Thy dealings with Thine own,

Where, with loved ones gone before,
We may love Thee and adore
In Thy presence evermore,
Bring us, holy Jesu.

God the Father! Whose creation
Gives to flowers and fruits their birth,
Thou, Whose yearly operation
Brings the hour of harvest mirth,
Here to Thee we make oblation
Of the August-gold of earth.
God the Word! the sun, maturing
With his blessed ray the corn,
Spake of Thee, O Sun enduring,
Thee, O everlasting Morn!
Thee in Whom our woes find curing
Thee that liftest up our horn.
God the Holy Ghost! the showers
That have fattened out the grain,
Types of Thy celestial powers,
Symbols of baptismal rain,
Shadowed out the grace that dowers
All the faithful of Thy train.
When the harvest of each nation
Severs righteousness from sin,
And archangel proclamation
Bids to put the sickle in,
And each age and generation
Sink to woe, or glory win;
Grant that we, or young, or hoary,
Lengthened be our span or brief,
Whatsoe’er the life long story
Of our joy or of our grief,
May be garnered up in glory
As Thine own elected sheaf.
Laud to Him to Whom supernal
Thrones and virtues bend the knee;
Laud to Him from Whom infernal
Powers and dominations flee;
Laud to Him the co-eternal
Paraclete, forever be.

God the Father’s only Son,
And with Him in glory One,
One in wisdom, One in might,
Absolute and infinite;
Jesu, I believe in thee,
Thou art Lord and God to me.
Preacher of eternal peace,
Christ anointed to release,
Setting wide the dungeon door,
Unto sinners chained before;
Jesu, I believe in Thee,
Christ the Prophet sent to me.
Low in deep Gethsemane,
High on dreadful Calvary,
In the garden, on the cross,
Making good our utter loss;
Jesu, I believe in Thee,
Priest and Sacrifice for me.
Ruler of Thy ransomed race,
And Protector by Thy grace,
Leader in the way we wend,
And Rewarder at the end;
Jesu, I believe in Thee,
Christ, the King of kings to me.
Light revealed through clouds of pain,
That the blind might see again; 
Love content in death to lie,
That the dead might never die:
Jesu, I believe in Thee,
Light and Love and Life to me.
All that I am fain to know
While I watch and wait below:
All that I would find above,
Length and depth and height of love:
Jesu, I believe in Thee,
Thou art All in All to me.

God the Lord is King: before Him
Earth with all thy nations, wait!
Where the cherubim adore Him,
Sitteth He in royal state:
He is holy; He is Holy;
Blessed, only Potentate!
God the Lord is King of glory,
Zion, tell the world His fame;
Ancient Israel, the story
Of His faithfulness proclaim:
He is holy; He is holy;
Holy is His awful Name.
In old times when dangers darkened,
When, invoked by priest and seer,
To His people’s cry He hearkened,
Answered them in all their fear;
He is holy, He is holy;
As they called, they found Him near.
Laws divine to them were spoken
From the pillar of the cloud;
Sacred precepts, quickly broken!
Fiercely then His vengeance flowed:
He is holy; He is holy;
To the dust their hearts were bowed.
But their Father God forgave them
When they sought His face once more:
Ever ready was to save them,
Tenderly did He restore:
He is holy; He is holy;
We too will His grace implore.
God in Christ is all forgiving,
Waits His promise to fulfill;
Come, exalt Him, all the living,
Come, ascend His holy hill;
He is holy; He is holy;
Worship at His holy hill.

God, the Lord, a King remaineth,
Robed in His own glorious light;
God hath robed Him and He reigneth;
He hath girded Him with might.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
God is King in depth and height.
In her everlasting station
Earth is poised, to swerve no more:
Thou hast laid Thy throne’s foundation
From all time where thought can soar.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Lord, Thou art forevermore.
Lord, the water floods have lifted,
Ocean floods have lift their roar;
Now they pause where they have drifted,
Now they burst upon the shore.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
For the ocean’s sounding store.
With all tones of waters blending,
Glorious is the breaking deep;
Glorious, beauteous without ending,
God Who reigns on heav’ns high steep.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Songs of ocean never sleep.
Lord, the words Thy lips are telling
Are the perfect verity:
Of Thine high eternal dwelling
Holiness shall inmate be.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Pure is all that lives with Thee.

God, the omnipotent! King Who ordainest
Great winds Thy clarions, lightnings Thy sword;
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.
God the all merciful! Earth hath forsaken
Thy ways of blessedness, slighted Thy Word;
Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.
God the all righteous One! Man hath defied Thee;
Yet to eternity standeth Thy Word,
Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.
God the all wise! By the fire of Thy chastening,
Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored;
Through the thick darkness Thy kingdom is hastening;
Thou wilt give peace in Thy time, O Lord.
So shall Thy children, with thankful devotion,
Praise Him Who saved them from peril and sword,
Singing in from ocean to ocean,
Peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord.

God the Spirit, we adore Thee,
In the trinal Godhead One,
One in love and power and glory
With the Father and the Son;
Prayer and praise to Thee we bring,
Our devotion’s offering.
Once the desolate world-ocean
Quickened from its long death-sleep,
Woke to light and life’s emotion
At Thy brooding o’er its deep;
Spirit, ever may Thy breath
Quicken us from sleep and death!
Holy Fount of inspiration,
By Whose gift the great of old
Spake the Word of revelation,
Marvelous and manifold,
Grant to us who see and hear
Reverence of eye and ear.
Priceless Gift of Christ for ever,
Righteousness and peace and joy,
Which the evil world, that never
Can receive, cannot destroy,
Shall the Church or faint or fear
While the Comforter is near?
Author of our new creation,
Giver of the second birth,
May Thy ceaseless renovation
Cleanse our souls from stains of earth,
And our bodies ever be
Holy temples meet for Thee.
When we wander, Lord, direct us,
Keep us in the Master’s way,
Let Thy strong, swift sword protect us,
Warring in the evil day;
Paraclete for every need,
Come to strengthen and to lead!
Come, Thy glorious gifts providing,
Foretaste of the future now,
Bring that sweet sense of abiding
Thou canst give and only Thou,
One in Thee, we shall be one
In the Father and the Son.Amen.

God told Nicodemus, God told Nicodemus
God, oh yes He did, He told Nicodemus a man he must-a be born again
Well-a God told Nicodemus, God told Nicodemus
God, oh yes He did, He told Nicodemus a man he must-a be born again 
Well there was a man among the Pharisees
By the name of Nicodemus who did not believe
Same Nicodemus came to God by night
Talkin' 'bout religion from the human sight
He brought along his silver, diamonds, and gold
Wanted to buy his way to Heaven and save his soul 
Well the same Nicodemus came a runnin' hard
Said "Has anybody here done seen the Lord?
I want to buy some 'ligion, but what will it cost
To get myself to Heaven 'fore my soul be lost?
Then my God spoke, He spoke so sweet
Sounded like the shuffle of angels feet
He said "Marvel thou man, if you want to be wise
You got to believe and be baptized" 
Then old Nicodemus was taken back
Cause God done told him 'bout the natural fact
He said "Marvel thou man, if you want to be wise
You got to believe and be baptized"
Old Nicodemus was taken back
Cause God done told him 'bout the natural fact
He said "I don't understand! I want to know
How can be born when he's old?"
Then my God spoke, His voice did ring
Sounded like the shuffle of angels wings
He said, "Marvel thou man, if you want to be wise
You got to believe and be baptized" 
Well-a God told Nicodemus, God told Nicodemus
God, oh yes He did, He told Nicodemus a man he must-a be born again
I said man you must-a be born again
We know that man you must-a be born again 

God, who touchest earth with beauty,
make my heart anew;
with thy Spirit recreate me,
pure and strong and true.
Like thy springs and running waters,
make me crystal pure;
like thy rocks of towering grandeur,
make me strong and sure.
Like thy dancing waves in sunlight,
make me glad and free;
like the straightness of the pine trees
let me upright be.
Like the arching of the heavens
lift my thoughts above,
turn my dreams to noble action:
ministries of love.
God, who touchest earth with beauty,
make my heart anew;
keep me ever by the Spirit,
pure and strong and true.

God, whose city's sure foundation
stands upon his holy hill,
by his mighty inspiration
chose of old and chooseth still
men of every race and nation
his good pleasure to fulfill.
Here in England through the ages,
while the Christian years went by,
saints, confessors, martyrs, sages,
strong to live and strong to die,
wrote their names upon the pages
of God's blessed company.
Some there were like lamps of learning
shining in a faithless night,
some on fire with love, and burning
with a flaming zeal for right,
some by simple goodness turning
souls from darkness unto light.
As we now with high thanksgiving
their triumphant names record,
grant that we, like the, believing
in the promise of thy word,
may, like them, in all good living
praise and magnify the Lord.

God, whose giving knows no ending,
from your rich and endless store--
nature's wonder, Jesus' wisdom,
costly cross, grave's shattered door--
gifted by you, we turn to you,
offering up ourselves in praise;
thankful song shall rise forever,
gracious Donor of our days.
Skills and time are ours for pressing
toward the goals of Christ, your Son:
all at peace in health and freedom,
races joined, the Church made one.
Now direct our daily labor,
lest we strive for self alone.
Born with talents, make us servants
fit to answer at your throne.
Treasure, too, you have entrusted,
gain through powers your grace conferred,
ours to use for home and kindred,
and to spread the gospel word.
Open wide our hands in sharing,
as we heed Christ's ageless call,
healing, teaching, and reclaiming,
serving you by loving all.

God whose love is everywhere
made our earth and all things fair,
ever keeps them in his care:
praise the God of love!
He who hung the stars in space
holds the spinning world in place;
praise the God of love!
Come with thankful songs to sing
of the gifts the seasons bring,
summer, winter, autumn, spring;
praise the God of love!
He who gives us breath and birth
gives us all the fruitful earth;
praise the God of love!
Mark what love the Lord displayed,
all our sins upon him laid,
by his blood our ransom paid;
praise the God of love!
Circled by that scarlet band
all the world is in his hand;
praise the God of love!
See the sign of love appear,
flame of glory, bright and clear,
light for all the world is here;
praise the God of love!
Gloom and darkness, get you gone!
Christ the Light of life has shone;
praise the God of love!

I asked the Lord to bless you
As I prayed for you today
To guide you and protect you
As you go along your way
His love is always with you
His promises are true
And when we give Him all our cares
We know He will see us through
So when the road you're traveling on
Seems difficult at best
Just remember; I'm praying for you
And God will do the Rest.

God will make a way,
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me
He will be my Guide
Hold me closely to His side
With love and strength for each new day
He will make a way, He will make a way.
By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me
And rivers in the desert will I see
Heaven and earth will fade
But His Word will still remain
He will do something new today.
God will make a way,
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me
He will be my Guide
Hold me closely to His side
With love and strength for each new day
He will make a way, He will make a way.

God will provide
All the riches and joy this world can conceive
He'll stay by your side
If you hold to the life
And truly believe 
When you go to the Lord, your dreams He'll fulfill
Like the Children of Israel
Bread everyday, manna from Heaven
Freedom from bonds from slavery (bonds of slavery)
Unceasing love with His arms open wide
To give to His children 
Go to the world, and tell the good news
Jesus died for all people
Raised from the dead, life everlasting
Heaven's our destination
Until that time He will meet all our needs
He blesses us daily 
He'll provide love, when you need it
He gives you breath, just breathe it
He gives you life, if you take it
Through Jesus, His Son
All You have to do is believe it
(All this love that God has provided) 
When you go to the Lord, your dreams He'll fulfill
Like the Children of Israel
Bread everyday (bread everyday), manna from Heaven
Freedom from bonds from slavery (bonds of slavery)
Unceasing love with His arms open wide
To give to His children 
If you hold to the life, and truly believe! 

God with us! O glorious Name!
Let it shine in endless fame:
God and man in Christ unite;
O mysterious depth and height!
God with us! the eternal Son
Took our soul, our flesh, and bone;
Now, ye saints, His grace admire,
Swell the song with holy fire.
God with us! but tainted not
With the first transgressor’s blot;
Yet did He our sins sustain,
Bear the guilt, the curse, the pain.
God with us! O wondrous grace!
Let us see Him face to face;
That we may Immanuel sing,
As we ought, our God and King! 

God, keep me safe; in You I refuge take.
You are my Lord; I have no good elsewhere.
The hearts of all idolaters will ache;
In all their sacrifices I’ll not share.
Lord, my inheritance You have assigned;
You guard what’s mine and make me feel secure.
Your boundary lines are pleasant to my mind;
Your future blessings will bring joy for sure.
Lord, I will praise You for Your counsel wise;
Even at night my heart tells me Your way.
I’ll always set You first before my eyes;
You’re right beside me; I won’t be afraid.
My heart is glad; my tongue rejoices e’er;
I know You will not leave me when I die.
The path of life to me You will declare;
You’ll fill me with eternal joy on high.

God, renew us by your Spirit!
Come in gladness, hearts console!
Grant us joy so we may share it!
Oh, restore us; make us whole!
God, revitalize our mission!
Bless your church from pole to pole!
May we overcome division!
Oh, restore us; make us whole!
God, revive each congregation!
Be our center and our goal!
Help us join in adoration!
Oh, restore us; make us whole!
God, refresh your whole creation!
Timeless is salvation’s role!
Grant us boundless celebration!
Oh, restore us; make us whole!

God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay,
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan’s power when we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.
In Bethlehem, in Israel, this blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger upon this blessed morn;
The which His mother Mary did nothing take in scorn.
From God our heavenly Father a blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name.
“Fear not, then," said the angel, “Let nothing you afright
This day is born a Savior of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him from Satan’s power and might."
The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethl’em straightaway this blessed Babe to find.
But when to Bethlehem they came where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray.
Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface.
God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign,
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again;
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near—
That God send you a happy new year, happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

God saved His people from distress
And led them through the wilderness;
Then mountains trembled in their place,
The heav’ns were bowed before His face.
With copious showers Thou didst assuage
The thirsting of Thy heritage;
Thy congregation dwelt secure;
Thou, God, art gracious to the poor.
With glorious pomp our King and God
Has entered into His abode
With sacred minstrelsy and song,
While maidens with their timbrels throng.
Assemble ye before His face,
All ye that spring from Israel’s race;
Ye chosen tribes with one accord
Come ye, and bless your God, the Lord.

God, that madest earth and Heaven, darkness and light;
Who the day for toil hast given, for rest the night;
May Thine angel guards defend us,
Slumber sweet Thy mercy send us;
Holy dreams and hopes attend us, all through the night.
And when morn again shall call us, to run life’s way,
May we still, whatever befall us, Thy will obey.
From the power of evil hide us,
In the narrow pathway guide us,
Nor Thy smile be ever denied us all through the day.
Guard us waking, guard us sleeping, and when we die,
May we in Thy mighty keeping all peaceful lie;
When the last dread call shall wake us,
Do not Thou, our God, forsake us,
But to reign in glory take us with Thee on high.

God, the offended God most high,
Ambassadors to rebels sends;
His messengers His place supply,
And Jesus begs us to be friends.
Us, in the stead of Christ, they pray,
Us, in the stead of God, entreat,
To cast our arms, our sins, away,
And find forgiveness at His feet.
Our God in Christ! Thine embassy,
And proffered mercy, we embrace;
And gladly reconciled to Thee,
Thy condescending goodness praise.
Poor debtors, by our Lord’s request
A full acquittance we receive!
And criminals, with pardon blessed,
We, at our Judge’s instance, live!

God, we’ve known such grief and anger
As we’ve heard your people cry.
We have asked you, “How much longer?"
We have sadly wondered, “Why?"
In this world of so much suffering,
May we hear your word anew:
“I will never leave you orphaned;
I will not abandon you."
By your grace comes resurrection;
By your love, you cast out fear.
You give strength and sure direction
As we seek to serve you here.
You give comfort to the grieving,
And you bless the ones who mourn.
May we trust in you, believing
Out of chaos, hope is born.
Hope is ours for, God, you love us!
You have claimed us by your grace.
And through Jesus, you have called us
To bring hope to every place.
In each rescue worker’s caring,
In each faithful volunteer,
In each Christian’s love and sharing,
God, we glimpse your kingdom here.

God, Who in various methods told
His mind and will to saints of old,
Sent down His Son, with truth and grace,
To teach us in these latter days.
Our nation reads the written Word,
That book of life, that sure record:
The bright inheritance of Heav’n
Is by the sweet conveyance giv’n.
God’s kindest thoughts are here expressed,
Able to make us wise and bless’d;
The doctrines are divinely true,
Fit for reproof and comfort, too.
[The last stanza would, obviously, need updating for a present day use.]
Ye British isles, who read His love
In long epistles from above,
(He hath not sent His sacred Word
To every land,) praise ye the Lord.

God, Who made the earth,
The air, the sky, the sea,
Who gave the light its birth,
He cares for me.
[originally, “Careth for me."]
God, Who made the grass,
The flow’r, the fruit, the tree,
The day and night to pass,
He cares for me.
God, Who made the sun,
The moon, the stars, is He
Who, when life’s clouds come on,
He cares for me.
God, Who made all things,
On earth, in air, in sea,
Who if I lean on Him,
Will care for me.
When in Heav’n’s bright land
I all His loved ones see,
I’ll sing with that blest band,
“God cared for me."

God, Who omniscient art,
Could we from Thee depart,
Hide aught from Thee,
Thou, Lord, would search it out,
Know all our sin and doubt,
Searching within, without,
Our secrets see.
Sorely oppressed are we,
Naught but affliction see,
O Lord, awake!
Lord, from Thy sleep arise,
No longer close Thine eyes;
See how we are despised,
All for Thy sake.
Humbled unto the dust,
In Thee alone we trust;
Thy love we plead.
Refuge in Thee to take,
Lord, for Thy mercy’s sake,
Our humble plea we make:
Thy help we need.

The God Who sits enthroned on high
The foolish to their heart deny;
Not one does good; corrupt in thought,
Unrighteous works their hands have wrought.
From heaven the Lord with searching eye
Looked down the sons of men to try,
To see if any understood
And sought for God, the only Good.
From righteousness they all depart,
Corrupt are all, and vile in heart;
Yea, every man has evil done;
Not one does good, not even one.
Has knowledge with the wicked failed,
That they My people have assailed,
That they delight in works of shame,
And call not on Jehovah’s Name?
Thy lowly servant they despise,
Because he on the Lord relies;
But they shall tremble yet in fear,
For to the righteous God is near.
O that from Zion, His abode,
Salvation were on us bestowed!
When God His exiles shall restore,
They shall in song His grace adore.

The God Whom earth, and sea, and sky,
Adore, and laud, and magnify,
Who o’er their threefold fabric reigns,
The virgin’s spotless womb contains.
The God Whose will by moon and sun
And all things in due course is done,
Is borne upon a maiden’s breast,
By fullest heavenly grace possest.
How blest the mother, in whose shrine
The great Artificer Divine,
Whose hand contains the earth and sky,
Vouchsafed, as in His ark, to lie!
Blest, in the message Gabriel brought;
Blest, by the work the Spirit wrought:
From whom the Great Desire of earth
Took human flesh and human birth.
All honor, laud, and glory be,
O Jesu, virgin-born, to Thee!
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.

God, whose love is always stronger
Than our weakness, pride and fear,
In your world, we pray and wonder
How to be more faithful here.
Hate too often grows inside us;
Fear rules what the nations do.
So we pray, when wars divide us:
Give us love, Lord! Make us new!
Love is patient, kind and caring,
Never arrogant or rude,
Never boastful, all things bearing;
Love rejoices in the truth.
When we’re caught up in believing
War will make the terror cease,
Show us Jesus’ way of living;
May our strength be in your peace.
May our faith in you be nourished;
May your churches hear your call.
May our lives be filled with courage
As we speak your love for all.
Now emboldened by your Spirit
Who has given us new birth,
Give us love, that we may share it
Till your love renews the earth!

God’s abiding peace is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now, yes I feel it now;
He has taken all my doubts and fears away,
Tho’ I cannot tell you how.
It is mine, mine, blessed be His Name!
He has given peace, perfect peace to me;
It is mine, mine, blessed be His Name!
Mine for all eternity!
He has wrought in me a sweet and perfect rest,
In my raptured heart I can feel it now;
He each passing moment keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light my heart and brow.
He has given me a never failing joy,
Oh, I have it now! oh, I have it now!
To His praise I will my ransomed pow’rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.
Oh, the love of God is comforting my soul,
For His love is mine, yes, His love is mine!
Waves of joy and gladness o’er my spirit roll,
Thrilling me with life divine.

There's no trouble there to borrow
For God's already there
Life was meaningless and empty
My heart filled with despair
Then I came to know my Savior
And found how much He cares
Now I'm not worried 'bout tomorrow
You won't find I even care
There's no trouble there to borrow
For God's already there
When I had lost a loved one
Saw no reason to go on
Just wondering what's ahead tomorrow
Jesus said, "You're not alone"
I live each day with expectation
Whether blessings or trials are there
'Cause I'm trusting now in Jesus
He leads me everywhere
And with my choices set before me
I choose Heaven over Hell
I have a home up there in glory
And it's there I'll ever dwell
For I'm not worried 'bout tomorrow
You won't find I even care
'Cause there's no trouble there to borrow
For God's already there
There's no trouble there to borrow
For God's already there (He's already, already there)

I heard the angels sing "Glory Hallelujah!"
A mighty way up high;
I heard the angels sing "Praise the name of Jesus!"
Singing in God's choir in the sky.
I heard a thousand trumpets sounding out His Glory,
Telling the story how He came to earth to die;
I heard a million voices praise the name of Jesus,
Singing in God's choir in the sky.
I heard the glorious song coming out of Heaven,
The sweetest music ever heard; 
I heard a mighty song sung by all the angels,
My soul thrilled at ev'ry loving word.
I heard a thousand trumpets sounding out His Glory,
Telling the story how He came to earth to die;
I heard a million voices praise the name of Jesus,
Singing in God's choir in the sky.
I fell down on my knees when that ended,
They shouted out a glad Amen! 
I fell down on my knees, prayed that when in heaven,
I would hear that choir once again.
I heard a thousand trumpets sounding out His Glory,
Telling the story how He came to earth to die;
I heard a million voices praise the name of Jesus,
Singing in God's choir in the sky.

Today as I was walking, In a field just down the way
I sat down on a fallin log, To pass the time away
And as I looked around me, The more I did look
The more I realized That I was viewing God's coloring book
I saw a golden ray of sun lite, A silver drop of dew
Some white floating clouds, Over a sky of Blue
A yellow dandelion, A pretty evergreen, Some red and orange 
flowers growing wild along a stream
And the more I looked around me, The more I did look, 
The more I did realize, I am viewing God's coloring book
Grayness in an old man's hair, The pink in baby's cheek
Blackness in a stormy sky, The brown in fallin leaves
And the multi-colored rainbows, Stretched out across the sky
And the purple haze of sunset, Just before the night
(Spoken) Then I turned my face toward the sky and say a silent prayer.
And though God doesn't speak to me I see him everywhere
He is all around me, He is every where I look, And
Each day is but a new page in God's coloring book
He is all around me, He is every where I look, And
Each day is but a new page, in Gods coloring book.

God’s eternal Word is spoken,
Piercing mists, around, above;
Of eternal might the token,
Emblem of eternal Love;
Out of darkness, world enthralling,
Into Light, O hear its calling.
Word of God, O Word eternal,
May we hear Thy living voice,
Learn the power of Love supernal,
Learn obedience, and rejoice;
God’s commands forever heeding,
Follow where His love is leading.

We're part of the family, that's been born again
Part of the family, whose love knows no end
For Jesus has saved us, and made us His own
Now were part of the family, that's on it's way home
And sometimes we laugh together
Sometimes we cry
Sometimes we share together
Heartaches and sighs
Sometimes we dream together
Of how it will be
When we all get to heaven, God's family
Verse with Spoken Vocal:
And tho some go before us.
Yes, it will be homecoming time.A time when we will all meet again.
Just inside the city.
That's right, they'll be waiting for us when we arrive in that heavenly city, 
just as we enter in.
There'll be no more parting.
It's together forever with all our loved ones.But not just our loved ones, 
we'll also be forever with Jesus.
Together forever, God's family
When we all get to heaven.
Eternity with God's wonderful family

God’s free mercy streameth over all the world,
And His banner gleameth, by His church unfurled;
Broad and deep and glorious, as the heaven above,
Shines in might victorious His eternal love.
Summer suns are glowing over land and sea;
Happy light is flowing, bountiful and free;
Everything rejoices in the mellow rays;
Earth’s ten thousand voices swell the psalm of praise.
Lord, upon our blindness Thy pure radiance pour;
For Thy lovingkindness we would love Thee more;
And when clouds are drifting dark across the sky,
Then, the veil uplifting, Father, be Thou nigh.
We will never doubt Thee, though Thou veil Thy light;
Life is dark without Thee, death with Thee is bright;
Light of light, shine o’er us on our pilgrim way;
Go Thou still before us to the endless day.

God’s glory is a wondrous thing,
Most strange in all its ways;
And, of all things on earth, least like
What men agree to praise.
Workman of God, O lose not heart,
But learn what God is like!
And, in the darkest battlefield,
Thou shalt know where to strike.
O blest is he to whom is given
The instinct that can tell
That God is on the field when He
Is most invisible!
Blest too is he who can divine
Where real right doth lie,
And dares to take the side that seems
Wrong to man’s blindfold eye.
For right is right, since God is God;
And right the day must win;
To doubt would be disloyalty,
To falter would be sin.

Press on, press on, ye workers,
Be loyal, brave, and true:
Great things the Lord is doing,
And greater things will do;
His army, still increasing
With each revolving year,
Shall send a shout of rapture forth
That all the world shall hear.
Rejoice, rejoice, ye workers all rejoice;
O, clap your hands and sing,
O, clap your hands and sing;
God’s holy Church shall triumph yet,
Triumph yet, triumph yet,
And He shall reign our King,
Shall reign our King.
The walls of leagued oppression
To dust shall fall away;
The sword of truth eternal
No power on earth can stay;
Though all the hosts of darkness
Were marshaled on the field,
The Church of God would stand unmoved,
With Christ her Strength and Shield.
Behold her marching onward,
In majesty sublime,
Along the rolling prairies
That bound our western clime;
And soon from every hamlet
On all our vast frontier
Glad songs shall rise to Jesus,
While skeptics turn to hear.

The only guide we have in life,
Is God's dear will, God's holy will,
Our comfort sure in pain and strife,
Is God's dear holy will.
Though the path seem dark and dreary,
And thy aching heart be weary,
Let this tho't console and cheer thee,
'Tis God's holy will.
If you desire true peace of mind,
Do God's dear will, God's holy will,
No surer way you'll ever find
Than God's dear holy will.
There is stored a priceless treasure.
There are joys beyond all measure
There alone is truest pleasure
In God's holy will.
The angels bright enthroned above
Do God's dear will, God's holy will,
The object of Dear Mary's love
Is God's dear holy will.
"twas the food of Jesus ever,
No
human power its claim can sever,
'Twill be our joy in Heav'n forever
'Tis God's holy will.

God’s love is as high as the heavens,
God’s love is as deep as the sea,
God’s love is for all kind of sinners,
God’s love is sufficient for me.
God’s love, God’s love,
God’s love is sufficient for me, for me,
God’s love, God’s love,
God’s love is sufficient for me.
God’s love is as wide as creation,
God’s love is as boundless and free,
God’s love, it has brought my salvation,
God’s love is sufficient for me.
God’s love brought His Son down from Heaven,
God’s love let Him die on the tree;
God’s love, it can never be measured,
God’s love is sufficient for me.

Our mighty God works mighty wonders—
What joy, to seem them all around!
Men’s idols fall before His thunders,
Their altars crumbling to the ground.
He breaks the fetters, frees the slaves,
His fallen children still He saves.
His mighty Word goes forth to conquer,
Its power destroys the forts of doubt.
The warriors bold yield up their armor
To Him Who will not cast them out.
They cleansing find in Jesus’ blood
And laud and magnify our God.
Behold the host of brethren nearing
The gates of Heav’n with mighty tread,
With banners waving, singing, cheering,
They hail in joy their Royal Head;
And many more shall own His reign,
His wondrous love the victory gain.
O God, be praised! the day is nearing,
When to our ears a voice shall come,
“Look up, the Lord is now appearing,
To gather all His loved ones home!"
O blessed day of jubilee!
For thee I wait! I wait for thee!

The night never looked
As dark as this
When the world slipped
Through our fingertips
I held you close
The tears pouring down
With thoughts of him
Spinning around
A spark of life
Like the wind to a flame
Who can stand
And who's to blame
And who are we
When we fail to cope
In the bad times
Is where we find our hope
We cannot answer
We'll never know
What is the basic question
Grows and grows
It's a life long mystery
Buried in the sand
It's all a part
Of God's plan
So hold me tight
Through this lullaby
There's always tomorrow
And the answer is life
And who are we
When we fail to cope
In the bad times
Is where we find our hope
We cannot answer
We'll never know
What is the basic question
Grows and grows
It's a lifelong mystery
Buried in the sand
It's all a part
Of God's plan
SOLO
It's a lifelong mystery
Buried in the sand
It's all a part
Of God's plan
It's all a part
Of God's plan
It's all a part
Of God's plan

He who brought His ancient people,
With a strong and mighty hand,
Out of all their cruel bondage,
Into Canaan’s promised land.
He has said, and we believe it,
’Tis a promise made of old,
From the trusting and the loving
No good thing will He withhold.
He who led them through the desert,
By the cloud that went before,
He whose goodness never failed them,
Though they grieved Him o’er and o’er.
God is faithful to His promise,
He is mindful of His own;
On our journey to His kingdom
We shall never walk alone.
We shall have His kind protection
And His love as in the past;
Though our days be few or many,
He will guide us to the last.

To us a child of royal birth,
The Heir of promise, now is giv'n:
Th'Invisible appears on earth—
The Son of Man, the God of Heav'n.
A Saviour born in love supreme,
He comes our fallen souls to raise;
He comes His people to redeem
In matchless love and boundless boundless grace.
The Christ, by raptured seers foretold,
Filled with th'eternal Spirit's pow'r,
Great Prophet, Priest and King behold,
And Lord of all the worlds adore.
The Lord of Hosts— the God most high
Shuns not His glorious throne to leave—
With joy we welcome from the sky,
With faith into our hearts receive.

God's Spirit, as a rising gale,
tears down our false tranquility;
come surging through our settled minds,
demolish our complacency!
God's Spirit, as the breath of life,
creation's source and guide and goal,
breathe life into our souls again;
restore our faith and make us whole.
God's Spirit, as an icy blast,
strike through the scorching enmity
that burns our human love to ash;
extinguish all hostility.
God's Spirit, as a healing breeze,
stream gently through our troubled days,
to set us on our feet again,
with confidence, delight, and praise.
God's Spirit, fierce and wild,
and yet unfolding like a mother's womb,
surprise us: bring us, newly born,
with Jesus leaping from the tomb!

God’s trumpet wakes the slumbering world;
Now each man to his post!
The red cross banner is unfurled;
Who joins the glorious host?
Who joins the glorious host?
He who, in fealty to the truth,
Not counting all the cost,
Doth consecrate his generous youth,
He joins the noble host, he joins the noble host.
He who, no anger on his tongue,
Nor any idle boast,
Bears steadfast witness ’gainst the wrong,
He joins the sacred host,
He joins the sacred host.
He who, with calm, undaunted will,
Ne’er counts the battle lost,
But, though defeated, battles still,
He joins the faithful host, he joins the faithful host.
He who is ready for the cross,
The cause despised loves most,
And shuns not pain, nor shame, nor loss,
He joins the martyr host,
He joins the martyr host.
God’s trumpet wakes the slumbering world;
Now each man to his post!
The red cross banner is unfurled;
We join the glorious host, we join the glorious host.

God’s way is the best way, though I may not see
Why sorrows and trials oft gather ’round me;
He ever is seeking my gold to refine,
So humbly I trust Him, my Savior divine.
God’s way is the best way,
God’s way is the right way,
I’ll trust in Him alway,
He knoweth the best.
God’s way is the best way, my path He has planned,
I’ll trust in Him alway while holding His hand;
In shadows or sunshine He ever is near,
With Him for my refuge, I never need fear.
God’s way shall be my way, He knoweth the best;
And leaning upon Him, sweet, sweet is my rest,
No harm can befall me, safe, safe shall I be,
I’ll cling to Him ever, so precious is He 

In humble faith at Jesus’ feet,
Oh, may I learn a lesson sweet,
That whether sun or rain I see,
God’s way is always best for me.
God’s way is best for you, for me;
Oh, may we all more trustful be,
Until, beyond the parting sea,
I’ll sing, God’s way was best for me.
His way may lead through sunny vales,
O’er rocky steeps, ’mid stormy gales;
The truest course His eye can see;
God’s way is always best for me.
He never bids me go alone;
His loving arms around me thrown,
My guide, my keeper He will be;
God’s way is always best for me.
So, step by step in faith and love,
I’ll walk the path that leads above:
Till day shall break, and shadows flee,
God’s way is always best for me.

God’s way is best; if human wisdom
A fairer way may seem to show,
’Tis only that our earth-dimmed vision
The truth can never clearly know.
God’s way is best, I will not murmur,
Although the end I may not see;
Where’er He leads I’ll meekly follow,
God’s way is best, is best for me.
Had I the choosing of my pathway,
In blindness I should go astray,
And wander far away in darkness,
Nor reach that land of endless day.
He leadeth true; I will not question,
Though through the valley I shall go;
Though I should pass through clouds of trial,
And drink the cup of human woe.
God’s way is best; heart, cease thy struggling
To see and know and understand;
Forsake thy fears and doubts, but trusting,
Submit thyself into His hand.
Thy way is best, so lead me onward,
My all I give to Thy control;
Thy loving hand will truly guide me,
And safe to glory bring my soul.

God’s Word is like a flaming sword,
A wedge that cleaves the stone;
Keen as a fire, so burns His Word,
And pierces flesh and bone.
Let it go forth o’er all the earth
To cleanse our hearts within,
To show God’s power in Satan’s hour
And break the might of sin.
God’s Word, a wondrous guiding star,
On pilgrim hearts does rise,
Leads those to God who dwell afar,
And makes the simple wise.
Let not its light e’er sink in night,
But in each spirit shine,
That none may miss Heaven’s final bliss,
Led by God’s light divine.

We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
Let's walk the heavenly road
I was livin' me life as an Anglican
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man
I was livin' me life as an Anglican
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man
One night I was walking down Fred'rick street
Poor and hungry no shoes on me feet
I passed a door that said "Down with sin"
It was the smell of food that pull me in
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
Let's walk the heavenly road
Well, the leader walked up and he shook my hand
Said "I want you to be a holy man"
Right away I made a big decision
Me stomach was a growling for this new religion
I started over to get some food
When some sisters approached me in a mystic mood
They dunked me in the water 'bout four five times
I couldn't see a thing 'cause I was almost blind
Singing I've got a sword in my hand
I'm going to use it well
I was drenched to me skin and I was feeling cold
But the sight of the food made me take a hold
The sisters started to break away
They said "Kneel believers kneel and pray"
I prayed and I prayed in a new-found style
In the meantime me taste buds was running wild
I was about to fall clear out of me seat
When a man jumped up and said
"Before you eat
You got to mourn children mourn
You got to mourn children mourn
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die,
You got to mourn children mourn"
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,
Now I find myself a free man again
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,
Now I find myself a free man again
Don't talk 'bout the leaders they treat me good,
Plenty sweet oil and plenty food
Brother it was then that I realized
Ev'ry man on earth should be baptized
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
Let's walk the heavenly road 

If I could take you back in time
To what was on the Father’s mind
When He sent His only Son
Away from home (away from home)
He looked down on sinful man
And knew He had to have a plan
So He sent Him down to Earth
To bring them home
Bring them home
Bring them home
I’ve reserved for them a place around my throne
And someday they won’t have to wait
Until they step through my gate
But until then, Son (until then)
Bring them home
And while He walked here on this earth
He talked about a second birth
He talked about His Father’s house
And goin’ home (goin' home)
He told them, “Don’t you be afraid
A mansion there for you is made
And my Father’s waiting there
Sayin', 'Come on home'"
Come on home
Come on home
You know you’re gonna see the face upon the throne
And someday you won’t have to wait
Until you step through my Father’s gate
But until then, child (until then)
Come on home
And when my race on earth is run
And the victory is won
When the trials of life are done
I’m goin’ home (goin' home)
So don’t you mourn for me down here
’Cause I’ll be so happy there
And when my Father calls for me
I’m goin’ home
Goin’ home
Goin’ home
You know I’m gonna take my place around the throne
And someday I won’t have to wait
Until I step through my Father’s gate
But until then I’m (until then)
I’m goin’ home
Goin’ home
Goin’ home
You know I’m gonna see the face upon the throne
And someday I won’t have to wait
Until I step through that gate
But until then I’m (until then)
I’m goin’ home
But until then I’m (until then)
I’m goin’ home

Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home)
Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home) 
Goin' home, goin' home, I'm a goin' home
Quiet like, still some day, I'm just goin' home
It's not far, just close by, through an open door
Work all done, care laid by
Going to fear no more
Mother's there, expecting me
Father's waiting too (father is waiting too)
Lots of folks gathered there (folks gathered there)
All the friends I knew
Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home, goin' home)
Goin' home 
Morning star lights the way
Restless dream all done
Shadows gone, break of day
Real life just begun
There's no break, ain't no end
Just a living on (just a living on)
Wide awake with a smile, going on and on
Goin' home, goin' home, I'm a goin' home (goin' home)
It's not far, just close by, I'm a goin' home
Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home, goin' home)
Goin' home
Nothing's lost, all is gain, no longing for the day
No more stumbling on the way
No more fret nor pain
Goin' home, goin' home, I'm a goin' home
Quiet like, still some day, I'm a goin' home
I'm just goin' home
I'm a goin' home
Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home)
Goin' home (goin' home, goin' home)
Home

Do you feel the love of Jesus?
Does it burn within your heart,
As you think of what He suffered,
That His life He might impart?
We are going home to glory,
By and by, by and by;
We are going home to glory,
By and by, by and by.
Do you know the love of Jesus?
Is it more than life to you?
Do you feel His arms around you?
Do you love His work to do?
Oh, my friend, it is so precious!
Living just for Jesus here;
Never need we fear or tremble,
Only trust that Friend so dear.
Jesus loves you, Jesus calls you,
Won’t you heed that call today?
Give yourself into His keeping;
He will lead you all the way.

The fires of the sun shall be quenched at last,
And the steadfast stars be gone;
But souls of the ransomed shall live in strength,
And they still shall be going on.
Going on, going on,
They still shall be going on;
Forever and aye, through eternal day,
They still shall be going on.
As souls that remember and feel and thrill,
We shall live when seas are dry;
As separate beings, to love and will,
We shall live, nevermore to die.
From glory to glory our path shall be,
And from grace to perfect grace;
Through all the wide years of eternity,
We shall look on our dear Lord’s face.
Going on, going on,
We still shall be going on;
Forever and aye, through eternal day,
We still shall be going on.

The golden gates are lifted up,
The doors are opened wide;
The King of Glory is gone in
Unto His Father’s side.
Thou art gone up before us, Lord,
To make for us a place,
That we may be where now Thou art,
And look upon God’s face.
And ever on our earthly path
A gleam of glory lies,
A light still breaks behind the cloud
That veiled Thee from our eyes.
Lift up our hearts, lift up our minds:
Let Thy dear grace be giv’n;
That, while we wander here below,
Our treasure be in Heav’n.
That where Thou art, at God’s right hand,
Our hope, our love, may be:
Dwell Thou in us, that we may dwell
Forevermore in Thee.

Golden harps are sounding, angels voices sing,
Pearly gates are opened, opened for the King;
Jesus, King of glory, Jesus, King of love,
Is gone up in triumph, to His throne above.
He Who came to save us, He Who bled and died,
Now is crowned with glory at His Father’s side.
From the grave arisen, nevermore to die;
Jesus, King of glory, is gone up on high.
Pleading for His children in that blessed place,
Calling them to glory, sending them His grace;
His bright home preparing, faithful ones, for you;
Jesus ever liveth, ever loveth, too.
All His suffering ended, joyfully we sing,
Jesus hath ascended! Glory to our King!

The golden morning is fast approaching;
Jesus soon will come
To take His faithful and happy children
To their promised home.
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
Piercing through this night of gloom!
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
That will burst the tomb.
The Gospel summons will soon be carried
To the nations round;
The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry
And the trumpet sound.
Attended by all the shining angels,
Down the flaming sky
The Judge will come, and will take His people
Where they will not die.
There those loved ones who have long been parted
Will all meet that day;
The tears of those who are brokenhearted
Will be wiped away.

On my way, on my way, 
On my way home, on my way
On my way (repeat)
Heaven’s where we want to go (You better get ready)
But for now (‘Cause you know not when the Lord will come)
We will wait here on the earth (Just keep your faith steady)
For that sound (The cross bears all, the battle has been won)
The dead in Christ will rise
Every knee will bow
The King will take His bride
When the trumpet sounds
Our Savior (Our Savior) has gone away
Promised He’s coming for us any day
We’re waiting (we’re waiting here) for His shout
Final revealing what it’s all about
On my way, on my way, on my way home,
On my way, on my way
It will be so nice on the (Oh won’t it be exciting)
Crystal shore (There’ll be no rich and there’ll be no poor)
Nobody will be left out (He’s always inviting)
Any more (We’ll all be the same on the crystal shore)
Descending on a cloud
Come to claim His own (claiming His own)
The Savior of the world
Will take His children home
He’s the way to get there
See you when I get there
He’s the way, He’s the way
On my way, on my way
He’s the way to get there (He is the way)
See you when I get there
He is the way and the truth and the life
Standing in the presence of (Oh tell me the story)
Christ the Lamb (of Christ the Lamb, the living Holy One)
We can hear the story from (We’ll live in his glory)
Him first hand (His light shines brighter than a million suns)
We’ll gather round the throne
Lift our praises high (Lifting our praises on high)
We’ll walk the street of gold
In the place where no one cries (Where no one cries)
Our Savior (our Savior) has gone away
Promised He’s coming for us any day
We’re waiting (we’re waiting here) for His shout
Final revealing what it’s all about
He’s the way to get there
See you when I get there
He’s the way, He’s the way (3x on my way, on my way)

Gone from my heart the world and all its charms;
Now through the blood I’m saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.
I love Him, I love him,
Because He first loved me,
And purchased my salvation
On Calv’ry’s tree.
Once I was lost, and way down deep in sin;
Once was a slave to passions fierce within;
Once was afraid to meet an angry God
But now I’m cleansed from ev’ry stain through Jesus’ blood.
Once I was bound, but now I am set free;
Once I was blind, but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,
To tell the world around the peace that He doth give.

All of my friends that I loved yesterday
Gone home (they have gone home)
Gone home (they have gone home)
The song bird that sings in the dale seems to say
Gone home (they have gone home)
Gone home (they have gone home)
They've joined the heavenly fold
They're walking on streets of pure gold
They left one by one as their work here was done
Gone home (they have gone home)
Gone home (they have gone home)
Life here is lonely since they've gone before
Gone home (they have gone home)
Gone home (they have gone home)
The old weeping willow that stands by the door sadly sings
Gone home (they have gone home)
Gone home (they have gone home)
The trumpet will sound 
On that great judgement day
Gone home (they have gone home)
Gone home (they have gone home)
We'll see all our friends 
Who have gone on that way
Gone home (they have gone home)
Gone home (they have gone home)

A gentle hand unseen by us
Has plucked our tender bud;
By this alone our grief is blest—
It was the hand of God.
O gentle one, we miss thee here,
Sweet form we love so well;
But in our Father’s better care,
We know the child is well.
In all our hearts He planted deep
This precious little one;
As forth He takes His own, we weep,
But say, “Thy will be done." 
No care was lavished here in vain
Upon this plant of love;
Though soon removed, ’twill bloom again
In sweeter form above.
Would not our grief forever flow
Upon thy silent tomb,
Did not our hearts this comfort know—
We soon to thee shall come.
Dear Jesus, Thou hast died for us,
And for our darling, too;
We trust Thee in each providence,
Thy love is ever true.

Good Christian men, rejoice with heart and soul, and voice;
Give ye heed to what we say: News! News! Jesus Christ is born today;
Ox and ass before Him bow; and He is in the manger now.
Christ is born today! Christ is born today!
Good Christian men, rejoice, with heart and soul and voice;
Now ye hear of endless bliss: Joy! Joy! Jesus Christ was born for this!
He has opened the heavenly door, and man is blest forevermore.
Christ was born for this! Christ was born for this!
Good Christian men, rejoice, with heart and soul and voice;
Now ye need not fear the grave: Peace! Peace! Jesus Christ was born to save!
Calls you one and calls you all, to gain His everlasting hall.
Christ was born to save! Christ was born to save!

Good it is to keep the fast,
Shadowed forth in ages past,
Which our own Almighty Lord
Hallowed by His deed and Word.
Moses, while he fasted, saw
God Who gave by him the law;
To Elijah angels came,
Steeds of fire and car of flame.
So was Daniel meet to gaze
On the sight of latter days
And the Baptist to proclaim
Blessings through the Bridegroom’s Name.
Grant us, Lord, like them to be
Oft in prayer and fast with Thee;
Fill us with Thy heavenly might,
Be our Joy and true Delight.
Father, hear us through Thy Son,
And the Spirit, with Thee One,
Whom our thankful hearts adore,
Ever and forevermore.

Good Joseph had a garden,
Close by that sad green hill
Where Jesus died a bitter death
To save mankind from ill.
One evening in that garden,
Their faces dark with gloom,
They laid the Saviour's body
Within good Joseph's tomb.
There came the holy women
With spices and with tears;
The angels tried to comfort them,
But could not calm their fears.
Came Mary to that garden
And sobbed with heart forlorn;
She thought she heard the gardener ask
'Whom seekest thou this morn?'
She heard her own name spoken,
And then she lost her care:
All in his strength and beauty
The risen Lord stood fair!
Good Joseph had a garden;
Amid its trees so tall
The Lord Christ stood on Easter Day:
He lives to save us all.
And as he rose at Easter
He is alive for ay,
The very same Lord Jesus Christ
Who hears us sing to-day.
Go tell the Lord Christ's message,
The Easter triumph sing,
Till all his waiting children know
That Jesus is their King.

Good King Wenceslas looked out on the Feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel.
“Hither, page, and stand by me, if you know it, telling,
Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling?"
“Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence, by Saint Agnes’ fountain."
“Bring me food and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither,
You and I will see him dine, when we bear them thither."
Page and monarch, forth they went, forth they went together,
Through the cold wind’s wild lament and the bitter weather.
“Sire, the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger,
Fails my heart, I know not how; I can go no longer."
“Mark my footsteps, my good page, tread now in them boldly,
You shall find the winter’s rage freeze your blood less coldly."
In his master’s steps he trod, where the snow lay dinted;
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure, wealth or rank possessing,
You who now will bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing.

Come on y'all and gather around 
That is why we've come to this town 
There is nothing better to do 
So we're gonna cut loose and sing for you 
We're gonna harmonize and we're gonna shout 
We're gonna tell you what good livin's about 
I don't know about anyone else 
But I've gotta cut loose and sing myself 
Come on y'all and grab you a part 
There's no better way for us to start 
We'll sing 'en fast and we'll sing 'en slow 
So get off your sear and just let go 
We're gonna sing We're gonna sing (We're gonna harmonize and shout 
Gonna tell you what good livin's about 
We're gonna sing, we're gonna shout 
We're gonna sing, Let's sing 
Gonna Sing Let's sing Yea! 

The good man’s steps are led aright,
His way is pleasing in God’s sight,
Established it shall stand;
He shall not perish though he fall,
The mighty Lord, Who rules o’er all,
Upholds him with His hand.
Though I am old who young have been,
No saint have I forsaken seen,
Nor yet his home in need;
He ever leads in gracious ways,
His life true charity displays,
His sons are blest indeed.
Depart from evil, do thou well,
And evermore securely dwell;
Jehovah loves the right.
His faithfulness His saints have proved,
Forever they shall stand unmoved,
But sinners God will smite.
The righteous, through His fav’ring hand,
Shall yet inherit all the land
And dwell therein for aye;
He talks of wisdom and of right,
In God’s pure law is his delight,
His steps go not astray.
The wicked, watching for their prey,
Desire the righteous man to slay,
But God is on his side;
He will not leave him in their hands
Nor count him guilty when he stands
In judgment to be tried.
Wait on the Lord and keep His way;
He will exalt thee, nor delay
To give the land to thee;
And when the wicked are cut off,
The wicked who against thee scoff,
Their judgment thou shalt see.
The wicked in great power are seen,
Like spreading tree with foliage green
That grows in native ground.
I looked again, they were no more;
I sought the men so proud before,
But they could not be found.
Mark thou the upright day by day,
Behold the perfect in his way,
His journey ends in peace.
Destroyed at once shall rebels be;
Cut off from all posterity,
Their very name shall cease.
Salvation is from God alone,
Whom as their covert saints have known
When by sore troubles tried;
The Lord, who helped in troubles past,
Will save them to the very last,
For they in Him abide.

He's not on a golden throne way off in outer space
And He's not hiding out in some big secret hiding place
I can guarantee He'll be your friend to touch and hold
And I'm qualified to tell it, 'cause I got Him in my soul
Good morning friend, good morning friend
Ev'ry day's a brand new morning since the morning you moved in
Good morning friend, good morning friend
Well I'm feeling like a million, since I've got you livin' in
He'll stand and knock upon your door 'til you let Him inside
He'll be your constant comforter and keep you satisfied
He'll make Himself available no matter who you are
He will light your darkest night and be your bright and morning star
Good morning friend, good morning friend
Ev'ry day's a brand new morning since the morning you moved in
Good morning friend, good morning friend
Ask me how I am this morning, and I'm proud to say again
Good morning friend, good morning friend
Ev'ry day's a brand new morning since the morning you moved in
Good morning friend, good morning friend
Every day's a brand new morning since the morning you moved in

Good news! good news of a soul redeemed,
A penitent forgiven!
Good news! good news that another friend
Is on the way to Heaven!
Rejoice! rejoice! there’s joy today
In the land beyond the river;
Another gem for His diadem,
A star to shine forever.
Good news! good news that another heart
Has learned redemption’s story;
Good news! good news that another voice
Will sing His praise in glory.
Good news! good news that another life
Will show the power of Jesus,
Will prove the might of the saving grace
Which daily, hourly frees us.
Good news! good news that another hand
Will precious seed be sowing,
Another guide to lead straying feet
Where living streams are flowing.

Good news from Heav’n the angels bring,
Glad tidings to the earth they sing:
To us this day a Child is giv’n,
To crown us with the joy of Heav’n.
All hail, Thou noble Guest, this morn,
Whose love did not the sinner scorn:
In my distress Thou com’st to me,
What thanks shall I return to Thee?
Were earth a thousand times as fair,
Beset with gold and jewels rare,
She yet were far too poor to be
A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.
Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,
Within my heart, that it may be
A quiet chamber kept for Thee.
Praise God upon His heavenly throne;
Who gave to us His only Son;
For this His hosts, on joyful wing,
A blest New Year of mercy sing.

Dear friends, we have precious tidings of old,
Would you receive greater riches than gold?
Hear it, all people, ye wealthy and poor,
Jesus will give you His peace evermore.
Good news, good news,
We will sing and proclaim tidings of redeeming love;
Good news, good news,
Full salvation for all, flowing from above.
Wonderful grace we declare unto you,
Truly we’ve tested and proved it is true,
How great is salvation! tongue cannot tell,
Saving the soul from the power of hell.
Ye infidels that so boldly appear,
Deep in your bosom you’re cankered with fear,
Come now to reason and honest intent,
And God will pardon if ye will repent.
Is there a poor sinner present tonight
Whose life is bitter and under a blight?
Should it be liquor or gloomy despair,
Surely our Savior can turn it all fair.

When comes to the weary a blessed release,
When upward we pass to His kingdom of peace,
When free from the woes that on earth we must bear,
We’ll say “good night" here, but “good morning" up there.
Good morning up there where Christ is the Light,
Good morning up there where cometh no night;
When we step from this earth to God’s Heaven so fair,
We’ll say “good night" here but “good morning" up there.
When fadeth the day and dark shadows draw nigh,
With Christ close at hand, it is not death to die;
He’ll wipe every tear, roll away every care;
We’ll say “good night" here, but “good morning" up there.
When home lights we see shining brightly above,
Where we shall be soon, through His wonderful love,
We’ll praise Him Who called us His Heaven to share,
We’ll say “good night" here, but “good morning" up there.

Good people all, this Christmas time,
Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done,
In sending His beloved Son.
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas Day;
In Bethlehem upon the morn
There was a blest Messiah born.
The night before that happy tide
The noble virgin and her guide
Were long time seeking up and down
To find a lodging in the town.
But mark how all things came to pass:
From every door repelled, alas!
As long foretold, their refuge all
Was but a humble oxen stall.
Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God’s angels did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
“Prepare and go", the angels said,
“To Bethlehem, be not afraid;
For there you’ll find, this happy morn,
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born."
With thankful heart and joyful mind,
The shepherds went the babe to find,
And as God’s angel has foretold,
They did our Savior Christ behold.
Within a manger He was laid,
And by His side the virgin maid
Attending to the Lord of Life,
Who came on earth to end all strife.

Good Thou art, and good Thou dost,
Thy mercies reach to all,
Chiefly those who on Thee trust,
And for Thy mercy call;
New they every morning are;
As fathers when their children cry,
Us Thou dost in pity spare,
And all our wants supply.
Mercy o’er Thy works presides;
Thy providence displayed
Still preserves, and still provides
For all Thy hands have made;
Keeps, with most distinguished care,
The man who on Thy love depends;
Watches every numbered hair,
And all his steps attends.
Who can sound the depths unknown
Of Thy redeeming grace?
Grace that gave Thine only Son
To save a ruined race!
Millions of transgressors poor
Thou hast for Jesus’ sake forgiven,
Made them of Thy favor sure,
And snatched from hell to Heaven.
Millions more Thou ready art
To save, and to forgive;
Every soul and every heart
Of man Thou wouldst receive:
Father, now accept of mine,
Which now, through Christ, I offer Thee;
Tell me now, in love divine,
That Thou hast pardoned me!

I cry out
For your hand of mercy to heal me
I am weak
I need your love to free me
Oh Lord, my rock
My strength, in weakness
Come rescue me, oh Lord
You are my hope
Your promise never fails me
And my desire is to follow you forever
For you are good, for you are good
For you are good to me
For you are good, for you are good
For you are good to me

I've told all my troubles goodbye,
Goodbye to each tear and each sigh.
This world where I roam cannot be my home,
I'm bound for that home in the sky.
I walk and I talk with my Lord,
I feast every day on His word,
Heaven is near and I can't stay here
Goodbye world, goodbye.
I won't have the blues anymore
When I step across to that shore.
And I'll never pine for I'll leave behind
My heartaches and cares ever more.
A day maybe two then goodbye,
Goodbye to each sorrow and sigh.
Heaven is near and I can't stay here,
Goodbye world, goodbye.
Now don't you weep for me when I'm gone
For I won't have to leave here alone.
And when I hear that last trumpet sound
My feet won't stay on the ground.
I'm gonna rise with a shout, gonna fly,
Gonna rise with my Lord in the sky.
Heaven is near and I can't stay here,
Goodbye world, goodbye.

A goodly theme is mine,
And eagerly I sing;
For bounteous words flow from my lips
As I salute the King.
Supremely fair He is,
In beauty peerless He;
For Him the favor of the Lord
Doth grace eternally.
Gird on Thy sword, O King,
Put on Thy majesty;
Ride out in full regalia,
And richest panoply.
Triumph in very truth,
In meekness and in right,
Let fly the arrows of revenge,
And vanquish in Thy might.
Thy throne is ever sure,
Established of God;
Its scepter is of righteousness,
Of equity its rod.
Thou lovest perfect right,
Hatest iniquity;
Therefore with oil of festive joy
The Lord anointed Thee.
Thy garments breathe of myrrh,
Of spices rich and rare;
Glad strains of joyous music ring
Throughout Thy palace fair.
Amid Thy glorious train
King’s daughters waiting stand,
And on Thy right the queen adorned
In gold from Ophir land.
O royal bride, give heed,
This King is now thy Lord;
Forsake thy former loyalties,
Full fealty accord.
Thy beauty and thy grace
Will then delight the King;
And they to thee, since thou art His,
Their precious gifts will bring.
Enthroned in royal state
And glorious thou shalt dwell,
With garments fair, inwrought with gold,
His bride He loveth well.
And they who honor thee
Shall in thy train attend,
And to the palace of the King
Shall joyfully ascend.
Then in Thy Father’s place
The sons of royal birth
Thou wilt endow with regal gifts
As princes of the earth.
Thy Name shall be proclaimed
Through all succeeding days,
And all the peoples everywhere
Shall give Thee endless praise.

Goodly were thy tents, O Israel,
Spread along the river’s side;
Bright thy star, which rose prophetic,
Herald of dominion wide;
Fairer are the homes of freemen,
Scattered o’er our broad domain;
Brighter is our rising daystar,
Ush’ring in a purer reign.
Welcome to the glorious freedom,
Which our fathers hither brought;
Welcome to the priceless treasure,
Which with constant faith they sought!
See, from ev’ry nation gath’ring,
Swarming myriads throng our coasts,
Hear, with steady steps advancing,
Ceaseless tread of countless hosts.
God of nations! Our Preserver,
Hear our prayers, our counsels bless;
Lift o’er all Thy radiant banner,
On these souls Thy love impress;
From Thy throne of endless blessing
O’er our land Thy Spirit pour;
In the grandeur of Thine empire
Reign supreme from shore to shore.

He was an old hand at livin' and makin' his way
He smelled like old whiskey and he needed a shave
His home was an alley off 8th Avenue
If you had a minute or an hour or two
He'd tell you the Gospel according to Luke
Luke carried his Bible in a crown royal bag
He wiped off his brow with an old dirty rag
He'd tell you straight out just the way he believed
Faith in the good Lord was all that ya need
I remember the mornin' he first preached to me
CH: He said give to your brother is he is in need
Offer up thanks for the gifts you receive
There's treasure in heaven for the generous few
That was the gospel according to Luke
So I bought him breakfast at the Daylight Cafe
Biscuits and gravy, hot coffee, and eggs
He was hungry and ragged, hadn't eaten in days
But I was the one there who felt out of place
When he folded his hands, bowed his head, and said grace
A week ago Wednesday, I saw him again
Downtown at the mission, surrounded by friends
Handin' out all the change he'd collected that week
Sayin' you boys might need this a lot more than me
I try hard to practice the words that I preach
CH: Give your brother if he is in need
Offer up thanks for the gifts you receive
There's treasure in heaven for the generous few
That was the gospel according to Luke
He was an old hand at livin' and makin' his way
He smelled like old whiskey and he needed a shave
His home was an alley off 8th Avenue
If you had a minute or an hour or two
He'd tell you the Gospel according to Luke

The Gospel message sent—
Is echoed back again,
From lips in prayer and praise,
And this the sweet :
That Jesus died for me—
Dear Lamb of Calvary.
The echo from each heart,
In answer to the call—
Is “Here am I, O Lord—
Lo! at Thy feet I fall;
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
I trust alone in Thee."
Its echoing strains are heard
From palace and from cot—
From lips of age and youth—
His blood can cleanse each spot;
Dear Lamb of Calvary,
I come, I come to Thee.
Oh, let the Gospel sound
In all the land abroad,
And send the echo round,
In honor of our Lord—
The Lamb of Calvary,
Has died to ransom Thee.

Two weary travellers from Jerusalem 
Walking along with a stranger on a dusty highway
Two weary travellers from Jerusalem
Walking with a stranger on the dusty road
And they walked another hour to Emmaus town
And shared their supper till the sun went down
When He broke the bread, word spread around
That Christ was on that Gospel Road
Matthew, Mark, and Luke and John
Told about Jesus on the dusty highway
How His pillow were the stones
Where He laid His head
How the hungry five thousand on the hill were fed
How they sent Him to the cross
And He came back and said
To walk upon that Gospel Road
Yes, and Paul and Silas in the midnight jail
For talking ‘bout Jesus on the dusty highways
Paul and Silas in the midnight jail
For talking ‘bout Jesus on the dusty road
And they sang out rejoicing and the jail split wide
The doors busted open and they walked outside
But they went back to preaching through the countryside
Walking on the Gospel Road
So two by two, three by three
They walked in His footsteps on the dusty highways
Two by two and three by three
They walked in His footsteps on the dusty road
And they died in shipwrecks and in the lion’s den
And they died on crosses and the spears of men
But when one fell, two more would start again
To walk upon that Gospel Road
Hey, won’t you come on with me from Jerusalem
And walking to Emmaus on that dusty highway?
Hey, won’t you come on with me from Jerusalem
And walking to Emmaus on that dusty road?
The travelling gets harder and with each rebuff
Some turn back because they’ve had enough
But Jesus told you it was gonna be rough
To walk upon His Gospel Road

I'm gonna take a trip
In that good old gospel ship
And I'm goin' far beyond the sky
And I'm gonna shout and sing
Until all heavens ring
When I'm biddin' this ole world goodbye
I have good news to bring
And that is why I sing
All of my joy with you I'd like to share
And when my ship comes in
I'm gonna leave this world of sin
I am goin' sailin' through the air
I can scarcely wait
you know I don't wanna be late
I wanna spend my time in prayer
Yes and when my ship comes in
I wanna leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air

The Gospel shows the Father’s grace,
Who sent his Son to save our race,
Proclaims how Jesus lived and died
That man might thus be justified.
It sets the Lamb before our eyes,
Who made th’atoning sacrifice,
And calls the souls with guilt oppressed
To come and find eternal rest.
It brings the Savior’s righteousness
Our souls to robe in royal dress;
From all our guilt it brings release
And gives the troubled conscience peace.
It is the power of God to save
From sin and Satan and the grave;
It works the faith, which firmly clings
To all the treasures which it brings.
It bears to all the tidings glad
And bids their hearts no more be sad;
The heavy laden souls it cheers
And banishes their guilty fears.
May we in faith its tidings learn
Nor thanklessly its blessings spurn;
May we in faith its truth confess
And praise the Lord our Righteousness!

[D]There's a right and a wrong way to praise th'Lord.
And the right way you must you must take[A]
If you [D]won't a friend at the journey's end
Out of debt on that [A]great pay[D]day.
Never [G]stop or wait lest you [D]be too late 
To inherit the golden [A]crown
You must [G]walk each day in the [D]gospel way
If the works of [A]God be [D]found
Do you love your neighbor as yourself
Do you cheat him not in trade
Would your conscience groan on tomorrow's dawn
Should you meet him on the way?
Never do good deeds for the praise of man
Giving gold that man might see
But in secret give, and in secret pray
He'll reward you openly.

When I was a child I spoke as a child
But I put away childish things
Now I'll never forget and you'll prob'ly suspect
That we are the children of the King (yeah)
Now that I'm a man I do what I can
To find what my Father wants for me
I got to be humble and kind as He changes my mind
As we're growing in His family
I can't keep from movin' when I'm seein' His glory
I can't quench this fire that's in my soul
I can't quench this fire that he's put in my soul
You gotta grow up (grow up) get ready (get ready)
Feast upon the things that you know
Just because you're older
Doesn't mean you're growin' colder
Why not be bolder as you're followin' Him
You gotta grow up (grow up) be steady (be steady) 
Don't be lost or tossed to and fro
And don't you lose that child-like trust in Him
When I'm on my own I feel so alone
Cause I'm leavin' Him far behind
If I push Him away, though He wants me to stay
He will not be forcing me in line (yeah)
But when I understand He has the best plan
And He's got it all planned for me
I will never regret if I only submit
To His providential sovereignty
I can't keep from movin' when I'm seein' His glory
I can't quench this fire.
I can't quench this fire that He's put in my soul
No one can explain the trials and struggles I've been going through
Growing pains and heartaches flood my way
I always fail when I take charge of all the things I'm going through
Instead of hearing what He has to say

Grace and truth shall mark the way
Where the Lord His own will lead,
If His Word they still obey
And His testimonies heed.
For Thy Name’s sake hear Thou me,
For Thy mercy, Lord, I wait;
Pardon my iniquity,
For my sin is very great.
He who walks in godly fear
In the path of truth shall go;
Peace shall be his portion here,
And his sons all good shall know.
They that fear and love the Lord
Shall His holy friendship know;
He will grace to them accord,
And His faithful covenant show.
Ever are my longing eyes
On the Lord, Whose watchful care,
When my foes their plots devise,
Keeps my feet from every snare.
Turn to me, Thy grace impart,
I am desolate indeed;
Great the troubles of my heart;

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilled.
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin.
Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, the mighty cross.
Dark is the stain that we cannot hide.
What can we do to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide,
Brighter than snow you may be today.
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe!
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?

Grace, ’tis a charming sound,
Harmonious to mine ear;
Heaven with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear.
Grace first contrived the way
To save rebellious man;
And all the steps that grace display
Which drew the wondrous plan.
Grace first inscribed my name
In God’s eternal book;
’Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
Who all my sorrows took.
Grace led my roving feet
To tread the heavenly road;
And new supplies each hour I meet,
While pressing on to God.
Grace taught my soul to pray
And made mine eyes o’erflow;
’Twas grace which kept me to this day,
And will not let me go.
Grace all the work shall crown,
Through everlasting days;
It lays in heaven the topmost stone,
And well deserves the praise.
O let Thy grace inspire
My soul with strength divine
My all my powers to Thee aspire,
And all my days be Thine.

In looking through my tears one day,
I saw Mount Calvary;
Beneath the cross there flowed a stream
Of grace, enough for me.
Grace is flowing from Calvary,
Grace as fathomless as the sea,
Grace for time and eternity,
Grace, enough for me.
While standing there, my trembling heart,
Once full of agony,
Could scarce believe the sight I saw
Of grace, enough for me.
When I beheld my every sin
Nailed to the cruel tree,
I felt a flood go through my soul
Of grace, enough for me.
When I am safe within the veil,
My portion there will be,
To sing through all the years to come
Of grace, enough for me.

Gracious and merciful, slow to anger
Great in love, the Lord is good to all
And His mercies are over all His works
All Your works shall give thanks to Thee, oh Lord
Righteous in all Your ways
Kind in all Your deeds
You satisfy our desires
and fulfill our every need (
And His mercies are over all His works
All Your works shall give thanks to Thee, oh Lord

Gracious Father, guard Thy children
From the foe’s destructive power;
Save, O save them, Lord, from falling
In this dark and trying hour.
Thou wilt surely prove Thy people,
All our graces must be tried;
But Thy Word illumes our pathway,
And in God we still confide.
We are in the time of waiting;
Soon we shall behold our Lord,
Wafted far away from sorrow,
To receive our rich reward.
Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,
Pure, unspotted, from the world;
Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us
Till Thy banner is unfurled.
With what joyful exultation
Shall the saints Thy banner see,
When the Lord for whom we’ve waited
Shall proclaim the jubilee!
Freedom from this world’s pollutions;
Freedom from all sin and pain;
Freedom from the wiles of Satan,
And from death’s destructive reign.

Gracious God, my heart renew,
Make my spirit right and true;
Cast me not away from Thee,
Let Thy Spirit dwell in me;
Thy salvation’s joy impart,
Steadfast make my willing heart.
Sinners then shall learn from me
And return, O God, to Thee;
Savior, all my guilt remove,
And my tongue shall sing Thy love;
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
And my mouth shall praise accord.
Not the formal sacrifice
Has acceptance in Thine eyes;
Broken hearts are in Thy sight
More than sacrificial rite;
Contrite spirit, pleading cries,
Thou, O God, will not despise.
Prosper Zion in Thy grace
And her broken walls replace:
Then our righteous sacrifice
Shall delight Thy holy eyes;
Free-will offerings, gladly made,
On Thine altar shall be laid.

Gracious Lord, remember David,
How he made Thy house his care,
How he vowed to seek no pleasure
Till Thy house he should prepare.
Lord, remember his devotion;
Restless in his courts he trod
Till he found a habitation
Fit for Israel’s mighty God;
Till he found a habitation
Fit for Israel’s mighty God.
Far away God’s ark was resting,
It is with His people now;
We will go into His temple,
At His footstool we will bow.
With the ark, Thy might revealing,
Enter, Lord, into Thy rest;
Let Thy priests be clothed with justice,
Let Thy joyful saints be blest;
Let Thy priests be clothed with justice,
Let Thy joyful saints be blest.
Let the king behold Thy favor
For Thy servant David’s sake,
Unto whom a sacred promise,
Sure and faithful, Thou didst make.
If his children keep Thy covenant
And Thy testimony own,
Then, as Thou, O Lord, hast promised,
They shall sit upon the throne;
Then, as Thou, O Lord, hast promised,
They shall sit upon the throne.
Thou, the Lord, hast chosen Zion,
Thou hast ever loved her well;
“This My resting place forever,
Here," Thou say’st, “I choose to dwell.
Surely I will bless and help her,
Feed her poor, her saints make glad,
And her priests shall stand before Me
In salvation’s garments clad;
And her priests shall stand before Me
In salvation’s garments clad.
“I will cause the might of David
Ever more and more to grow;
On the path of Mine Anointed
I will make a lamp to glow.
All His enemies shall perish,
I will cover them with shame;
But His crown shall ever flourish;
Blessed be His holy Name;
But His crown shall ever flourish;
Blessed be His holy Name."

Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Hide not Thy face from me;
Sick and faint, as the leper came,
Jesus, I come to Thee.
Thou canst remove the plague of sin,
Washing my inmost soul;
Jesus, I come with breaking heart,
Help me and make me whole.
Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Speak, and my soul shall live;
O my faith will not let Thee go
Till Thou my sin forgive.
Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Weary and sad am I;
Bending low at Thy sacred feet,
Hear my repentant cry;
Faith in Thy Word has led me here,
Faith cannot plead in vain;
Lord, I believe; O cleanse me now,
Wash me from every stain.
Gracious Lord, Thou canst make me clean;
Lord, I am pleading still;
Now I hear from Thy lips divine,
“Child, thou hast faith—I will";
Joy to my soul, great joy has come,
Mourning and tears are o’er;
Sweet are Thy words of love to me,
“Go thou, and sin no more."

Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,
Our little ones are dear to Thee;
Gathered with Thine arms and carried
In Thy bosom may they be
Sweetly, gently, safely tended,
From all want and danger free.
Tender Shepherd, never leave them
From Thy fold to go astray;
By Thy look of love directed,
May they walk the narrow way;
Thus direct them, and protect them,
Lest they fall an easy prey.
Let Thy holy Word instruct them:
Fill their minds with heav’nly light;
Let Thy love and grace constrain them,
To approve whate’er is right,
Take Thine easy yoke and wear it,
And to prove Thy burden light.
Cleanse their hearts from sinful folly
In the stream Thy love supplied;
Mingled streams of blood and water
Flowing from Thy wounded side;
And to heav’nly pastures lead them,
Where Thine own still waters glide.

Gracious Savior, Who didst honor
Womankind as woman’s Son;
Very Man, though God begotten,
And with God the Father One;
Grant our womanhood may be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
Jesus, Son of human mother,
Bless our motherhood, we pray;
Give us grace to lead our children,
Draw them to Thee day by day;
May our sons and daughters be
Dedicated, Lord, to Thee.
Thou Who didst with Joseph labor,
Nor didst humble work disdain,
Grant we may Thy footsteps follow
Patiently through toil and pain;
May our quiet home life be
Lived, O Lord, in Thee, to Thee.
Thou Who didst go forth in sorrow,
Toiling for the souls of men,
Thou Who shalt draw all men to Thee,
Though despised, rejected then;
Humble though our influence be,
Use it in the world for Thee.

Gracious Spirit, Dove divine,
Let Thy light within me shine;
All my guilty fears remove,
Fill me full of Heav’n and love.
Speak Thy pardoning grace to me,
Set the burdened sinner free;
Lead me to the Lamb of God,
Wash me in His precious blood.
Life and peace to me impart,
Seal salvation in my heart;
Breathe Thyself into my breast,
Earnest of immortal rest.
Let me never from Thee stray,
Keep me in the narrow way;
Fill my soul with joy divine,
Keep me, Lord, forever Thine.
Guard me round, on every side,
Save me from self righteous pride;
Me with Jesu’s mind inspire,
Melt me with celestial fire.
Thou my dross and tin consume,
Let Thy inward kingdom come;
All my prayer and praise suggest,
Dwell and reign within my breast.

Gracious Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would gracious be;
And with words that help and heal
Would Thy life in mine reveal;
And with actions bold and meek
Would for Christ my Savior speak.
Truthful Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would truthful be;
And with wisdom kind and clear
Let Thy life in mine appear;
And with actions brotherly
Speak my Lord’s sincerity.
Tender Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would tender be;
Shut my heart up like a flower
In temptation’s darksome hour,
Open it when shines the sun,
And his love by fragrance own.
Mighty Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would mighty be;
Mighty so as to prevail,
Where unaided man must fail;
Ever, by a mighty hope,
Pressing on and bearing up.
Holy Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would holy be;
Separate from sin, I would
Choose and cherish all things good,
And whatever I can be
Give to Him Who gave me Thee!

Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,
Taught by Thee we covet most
Of Thy gifts of Pentecost
Holy, heavenly Love.
Faith, that mountains could remove,
Tongues of earth or heaven above,
Knowledge—all things—empty prove,
Without heavenly Love.
Though I as a martyr bleed,
Give my goods the poor to feed,
All is vain—if Love I need;
Therefore, give us Love.
Love is kind, and suffers long
Love is meek, and thinks no wrong,
Love than death itself more strong;
Therefore, give us Love.
Prophecy will fade away,
Melting in the light of day,
Love will ever with us stay;
Therefore, give us Love.
Faith will vanish into sight;
Hope be emptied in delight;
Love in heaven will shine more bright;
Therefore, give us Love.
Faith and Hope and Love we see
Joining hand in hand agree;
But the greatest of the three,
And the best, is Love.
From the overshadowing
Of Thy gold and silver wing
Shed on us, who to Thee sing,
Holy, heavenly Love.

Grains of wheat, richly gilded by the sun,
Purple clusters, collected from the vine,
These are altered, becoming love's own bread and sweet wine,
Now for us Jesus' body and his blood.
We enjoy true communion in this meal,
Many grains God has planted and made thrive;
Like the grain we are ground beneath life's sorrowful wheel,
In the bread, like the grain, we come alive.
As the grains join to form one loaf of bread,
As the notes come together in one song,
As the raindrops unite into the single vast sea,
So in Jesus' one body we belong.
We shall all sit together at the feast
Sharing bread as God's children, joined in one:
In this hope we rejoice as we go forward in peace,
Loving sisters and brothers of the Son.

Grander than ocean’s story,
Or songs of forest trees;
Purer than breath of morning,
Or evening’s gentle breeze;
Clearer than mountain echoes
Ring out from peaks above,
Rolls on the glorious anthem
Of God’s eternal love.
Dearer than any friendship
Our truest comrades show;
Stronger than all the yearning
A mother’s heart may know;
Deeper than earth’s foundations,
And far above all thought;
Broader than Heav’n’s high arches—
The love that Christ has brought.
Richer than all earth’s treasures,
The wealth my soul receives;
Brighter than royal jewels,
The crown that Jesus gives;
Wondrous the condescension,
And grace beyond degree!
I would be ever singing
The love of Christ to me.

Granted is the Saviour's prayer,
Sent the gracious Comforter;
Promise of our parting Lord,
Jesus now to heaven restored:
Christ who, now gone up on high,
Captive leads captivity;
While his foes from him receive
Grace that God with man may live.
God, the everlasting God,
Makes with mortals his abode;
Whom the heav'ns cannot contain,
He vouchsafes to dwell in man.
Never will he thence depart,
Inmate of an humble heart;
Carrying on his work within,
Striving till he casts out sin.
Come, divine and peaceful Guest,
Enter our devoted breast;
Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire,
Kindle there the Gospel-fire.
Now descend, and shake the earth;
Wake us into second birth;
Life divine in us renew,
Thou the gift and giver too!

Now in a song of grateful praise To Thee,
O Lord, my voice I'll raise;
With all Thy saints I'll join to tell:
My Jesus hath done all things well.
And above the rest this note shall swell:
My Jesus hath done all things well.
How sov'reign, wonderful and free
Hath been Thy wond'rous love to me!
Thou sav'dst me from the jaws of hell:
My Jesus hath done all things well.
Since e'er my soul has known Thy love,
What mercies Thou hast made me prove:
Thy mercies do all praise excel;
My Jesus hath done all things well.
And when to that bright world I rise,
And join the anthems of the skies,
Above the rest this note shall swell:
My Jesus hath done all things well.

The grave itself a garden is,
Where loveliest flowers abound;
Since Christ, our never fading Life,
Sprang from that holy ground.
O give us grace to die to sin,
That we, O Lord, may have
So holy, happy rest in Thee,
A Sabbath in the grave.
Thou, Lord, baptized in Thine own blood,
And buried in the grave,
Didst raise Thyself to endless life,
Omnipotent to save.
Baptized into Thy death we died,
And buried were with Thee,
That we might fly with Thee to God,
And ever blest might be.
Lord, through the grave and gate of death
May we, with Thee, arise
To an eternal Easter day
Of glory in the skies!

When the grave robber comes (9-fold x
There's a step that we all
Take alone
An appointment we have
With the great unknown
Like a vapor, this life is waiting to pass
Like the flowers that fade
Like the withering grass
But life seems so long
And death so complete
And the grave an impossible portion to cheat
But there's One who has been there, still lives to tell
There is One Who has been through both Heaven and Hell
And the grave will come up empty-handed that day
Jesus will come and steal us away 
Where is the sting, tell me where is the bite?
When the grave robber comes like a thief in the night
Where is the victory? Where is the prize?
When the grave robber comes and death finally dies 
When the grave robber comes (9-fold) 
Many still mourn
Many still weep
For those whom they love
Who have fallen asleep
But we have this hope
Though our hearts may still ache
Just one shout from above
And they all will awake
And in the reunion of joy will we sing
Death will be swallowed in sweet victory 
When the last enemy is gone
Out of the dust will come a song
Those asleep will be awakened
Not a one will be forsaken
He shall wipe away all tears
He will steal away our fears
There will be no sad tomorrow
There will be no pain or sorrow 
Where is the sting, tell me where is the bite?
When the grave robber comes like a thief in the night
Where is the victory? (fade) 

Great and marvelous are Your works
Oh Lord God th' Almighty
Righteous and true are Your ways
Thou King of the nations
Who will not fear and glorify Thy name
For You alone are holy
All the nations will come
All the nations will come
All the nations will come and
worship before Thee

great and mighty wonder, a full and holy cure:
The virgin bears the Infant with virgin honor pure!
And peace on earth to men!"
The Word becomes incarnate and yet remains on high,
And cherubim sing anthems to shepherds from the sky.
And peace on earth to men!"
While thus they sing your Monarch, those bright angelic bands,
Rejoice, ye vales and mountains, ye oceans, clap your hands.
And peace on earth to men!"
Since all He comes to ransom, by all be He adored,
The Infant born in Bethl’em, the Savior and the Lord.
And peace on earth to men!"
And idol forms shall perish, and error shall decay,
And Christ shall wield His scepter, our Lord and God for aye.
And peace on earth to men!"

Great Apollyon, grim and awful, steeped in gore and stained in blood—
Death, with all his fearsome forces, has besieged the Son of God.
Satan, clothed with evil armor, darkly gleaming, proud and cold—
Merciless, he joins the battle, armed and clad with pow’r untold.
Bowed beneath demonic onslaughts, Jesus fights His awesome duel!
Pain devours its Holy Victim, searing, savage, raging, cruel!
Eager waits the Mouth of Sheol, huge, insatiable, and strong!
Maw agape, the Grave yearns after Holy Flesh—but not for long.
Writhing under Law’s most fearsome curse, ruined, lost, polluted, wrecked;
Languishing in Satan’s prison lie the souls of God’s elect.
At the Cross—desire of Hell!—Christ gives up that final Breath:
Now, at last, the choicest Captive tastes the mortal sting of Death!
Darkness falls; the seething smoke of Hell cloaks the battlefield from view.
Down the head of God has fallen: Law and Wrath receive their due!
Satan smiles in seeming triumph, reaching out, his Prize to take.
Three brief days all Hell rejoices—then the stone begins to shake!
Now the night of wrong is ended; now the Grave has lost its Prize!
Now the Ris’n One breaks the back of Sin: There! Behold! See how Death dies!
Resurrection Light now scatters Satan’s armies from the field.
Christ has drawn the fearful sting of Death: Sheol and Abaddon yield!
At His Glance the mighty prison built by Law and Sin falls down! 
Countless in their thousand thousands, all His Ransomed praise His Crown!
Heav’n and Hell’s astonished spirits in their joy and rage all stare 
At the Victor of the Cross Who won His greatest Battle there.

The great archangel’s trump shall sound,
While twice ten thousand thunders roar
Tear up the graves, and cleave the ground,
And make the greedy sea restore.
The greedy sea shall yield her dead,
The earth no more her slain conceal;
Sinners shall lift their guilty head,
And shrink to see a yawning hell.
But we, who now our Lord confess,
And faithful to the end endure,
Shall stand in Jesus’ righteousness,
Stand, as the Rock of ages, sure.
We, while the stars from heaven shall fall,
And mountains are on mountains hurled,
Shall stand unmoved amidst them all,
And smile to see a burning world.
The earth, and all the works therein,
Dissolve, by raging flames destroyed,
While we survey the awful scene,
And mount above the fiery void.
By faith we now transcend the skies,
And on that ruined world look down;
By love above all height we rise,
And share the everlasting throne.

My God is a great big God
And a great big God is my God
My God is a great big God, glory
My God is a great big God
And a great big God is my God
My God is a great big God, glory
Holy, holy, ho - ly
Holy is my God
Worthy, worthy, wo - rthy
Worthy is my God
Mighty, mighty, might - y
Mighty is my God
Glory, glory, glo - ry
Glory to my God

The great forerunner of the morn,
The herald of the Word, is born:
And faithful hearts shall never fail
With thanks and praise his light to hail.
With heavenly message Gabriel came,
That John should be that herald’s name,
And with prophetic utterance told
His actions great and manifold.
John, still unborn, yet gave aright
His witness to the coming Light;
And Christ, the Sun of all of all the earth,
Fulfilled that witness at His birth.
Of woman born shall never be
A greater prophet than was he,
Whose mighty deeds exalt his fame
To greater than a prophet’s name.
But why should mortal accents raise
The hymn of John the Baptist’s praise?
Of whom, or e’er his course was run,
Thus spake the Father to the Son?
“Behold, My herald, who shall go
Before Thy face Thy way to show,
And shine, as with the day-star’s gleam,
Before Thine own eternal beam."
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
Whom with the Spirit we adore
Forever and forevermore.

Great Former of this various frame,
Our souls adore Thine awful Name;
And bow and tremble while they praise
The Ancient of eternal days.
Thou, Lord, with unsurprised survey,
Saw’st nature rising yesterday;
And, as tomorrow, shall Thine eye
See earth and stars in ruin lie.
Beyond an angel’s vision bright,
Thou dwell’st in self existent light;
Which shines, with undiminished ray,
While suns and worlds in smoke decay.
Our days a transient period run,
And change with every circling sun;
And, in the firmest state we boast,
A moth can crush us into dust.
But let the creatures fall around;
Let death consign us to the ground;
Let the last general flame arise,
And melt the arches of the skies:
Calm as the summer’s ocean, we
Can all the wreck of nature see,
While grace secures us an abode,
Unshaken as the throne of God.

Great God and Saviour, on this Easter day
Gathered in Thy presence, we Thy children pray;
Make our praises incense, waft them all around
As we lift our voices, this the joyful sound:
We’re here to praise You, Resurrection Day
Fill us with Your Spirit, speak, O Lord, we pray.
Angels announce Him, Jesus is the Lord and Christ
Source of our redemption, centre of our tryst;
He the Way has opened so that sinners we
Find through Him our pardon, peace and purity.
Death hides no terrors, naught can separate
Thou the conqu’ring Saviour we appreciate;
Worshipping before Thee, in Thy righteousness
Thy death hath procured this, Thee we gladly bless.
Here then is Jesus, sound His praises long,
Blend them all together, sing them in a song.
Make them loud and joyful, ‘Resurrection Day’
Christ is all victorious, nothing more to pay.

Great God! Attend, while Zion sings
The joy that from Thy presence springs;
To spend one day with Thee on earth
Exceeds a thousand days of mirth,
Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.
Might I enjoy the meanest place
Within Thy house, O God of grace,
Nor tents of ease, nor thrones of power,
Should tempt my feet to leave Thy door,
Should tempt my feet to leave Thy door.
God is our Sun, He makes our day;
God is our Shield; He guards our way
From all the assaults of hell and sin,
From foes without, from foes within,
From foes without, from foes within.
All needful grace will God bestow,
And crown that grace with glory too!
He gives us all things, and withholds
No real good from upright souls,
No real good from upright souls.
O God, our King, Whose sovereign sway
The glorious hosts of heaven obey,
And devils at Thy presence flee,
Blest is the man that trusts in Thee,
Blest is the man that trusts in Thee.

Great God, Dismiss Us in Thy Love
Direct our minds and thoughts above;
Though we asunder here must part,
In tender love unite each heart.
Be with us, Lord, where'er we go;
Direct in all we say and do;
Keep us from hurtful snares and sin;
Watch o'er us till we meet again.
Be with us through the time of life;
Keep us from envy, hate, and strife;
From malice let our lives be free,
And know and worship only thee.
Be with us that trying hour
When life shall cease, and death have pow'r;
Safe guide us all to heaven, then
We'll praise thee evermore, Amen.

Great God, My Maker and my King
Of thee I'll speak, of thee I'll sing
All thou hast done, and all thou dost
Declare thee good, proclaim thee just 
Thy ancient thoughts and firm decrees
The threat'nings and thy promises
The joys of heaven, the pains of hell
What angels taste, what devils feel 
Thy terrors and thy acts of grace
Thy threat'ning rod and smiling face
Thy wounding, and thy healing word
A world undone, a church restored 
While these excite my fear and joy
While these my tuneful lips employ
Accept, O Lord, the humble song
The tribute of a trembling tongue.

The great God of Heaven is come down to earth,
His mother a virgin, and sinless His birth;
The Father eternal His Father alone:
He sleeps in the manger; He reigns on the throne.
Then let us adore Him, and praise His great love:
To save us poor sinners He came from above.
A Babe on the breast of a maiden He lies,
Yet sits with the Father on high in the skies;
Before Him their faces the seraphim hide,
While Joseph stands waiting, unscared, by His side.
Lo! here is Emmanuel, here is the Child,
The Son that was promised to Mary so mild;
Whose power and dominion shall ever increase,
The Prince that shall rule o’er a kingdom of peace.
The Wonderful Counselor, boundless in might,
The Father’s own image, the beam of His light;
Behold Him now wearing the likeness of man,
Weak, helpless, and speechless, in measure a span.
O wonder of wonders, which none can unfold:
The Ancient of Days is an hour or two old;
The Maker of all things is made of the earth,
Man is worshipped by angels, and God comes to birth:
The word in the bliss of the Godhead remains,
Yet in flesh comes to suffer the keenest of pains;
He is that He was, and forever shall be,
But becomes that He was not, for you and for me.

Great God of nations, now to Thee
Our hymn of gratitude we raise;
With humble heart and bending knee
We offer Thee our song of praise.
Thy Name we bless, Almighty God,
For all the kindness Thou hast shown
To this fair land the pilgrims trod,
This land we fondly call our own.
Here freedom spreads her banner wide
And casts her soft and hallowed ray;
Here Thou our fathers’ steps didst guide
In safety through their dangerous way.
We praise Thee that the Gospel’s light
Through all our land its radiance sheds,
Dispels the shades of error’s night,
And heavenly blessings round us spreads.
Great God, preserve us in Thy fear;
In danger still our Guardian be;
O spread Thy truth’s bright precepts here;
Let all the people worship Thee.

Great God of wonders! All Thy ways
Are matchless, Godlike and divine;
But the fair glories of Thy grace
More Godlike and unrivaled shine,
More Godlike and unrivaled shine.
Crimes of such horror to forgive,
Such guilty, daring worms to spare;
This is Thy grand prerogative,
And none shall in the honor share,
And none shall in the honor share
Angels and men, resign your claim
To pity, mercy, love and grace:
These glories crown Jehovah’s Name
With an incomparable glaze
With an incomparable glaze.
In wonder lost, with trembling joy,
We take the pardon of our God:
Pardon for crimes of deepest dye,
A pardon bought with Jesus’ blood,
A pardon bought with Jesus’ blood.
O may this strange, this matchless grace,
This Godlike miracle of love,
Fill the whole earth with grateful praise,
And all th’angelic choirs above,
And all th’angelic choirs above.
Who is a pardoning God like Thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
Or who has grace so rich and free?

Great God, the heav’ns’ well ordered frame
Declares the glories of Thy Name:
There Thy rich works of wonder shine;
A thousand starry beauties there
A thousand radiant marks appear
Of boundless power and skill divine.
From night to day, from day to night,
The dawning and the dying light
Lectures of heav’nly wisdom read;
With silent eloquence they raise
Our thoughts to our Creator’s praise,
And neither sound nor language need.
Yet their divine instructions run
Far as the journeys of the sun,
And every nation knows their voice:
The sun, like some young bridegroom dressed
Breaks from the chambers of the east,
Rolls round, and makes the earth rejoice.
Where’er he spreads his beams abroad
He smiles and speaks his Maker God;
All nature joins to show Thy praise:
Thus God in every creature shines;
Fair is the book of nature’s lines,
But fairer is Thy book of grace.

Great God, the nations of the earth,
Are by creation Thine;
And in Thy works, by all beheld,
Thy radiant glories shine.
But, Lord, Thy greater love has sent
Thy Gospel to mankind,
Unveiling what rich stores of grace
Are treasured in Thy mind.
When, Lord, shall these glad tidings spread
The spacious earth around,
Till every tribe and every soul
Shall hear the joyful sound?
Smile, Lord, on each divine attempt
To spread the Gospel’s rays,
And build on sin’s demolished throne
The temples of Thy praise.

Great God, the world is full of Thee,
Thy kindness, and Thy power;
The bright blue sky, and rolling sea,
Green tree, and summer flower.
And every day, and everywhere,
Thou watchest everything;
The tender lamb enjoys Thy care;
The little birds that sing.
And very, very kind indeed
Thou art, O God, to me;
Supplying all my daily need;
And helping patiently.
Teach my young heart to yield its love
Through Jesus Christ, Thy Son;
That I may dwell with Thee above,
When life below is done.

Great God! to me the sight afford
To him of old allowed;
And let my faith behold its Lord
Descending in a cloud.
In that revealing Spirit come down,
Thine attributes proclaim,
And to my inmost soul make known
The glories of Thy Name.
Jehovah, Christ, I Thee adore,
Who gav’st my soul to be!
Fountain of being, and of power,
And great in majesty.
The Lord, the mighty God, Thou art;
But let me rather prove
That name in-spoken to my heart,
That favorite name of Love.
Merciful God, Thyself proclaim
In this polluted breast;
Mercy is Thy distinguished name,
Which suits a sinner best.
Our misery doth for pity call,
Our sin implores Thy grace;
And Thou art merciful to all
Our lost, apostate race.

Great God, to thee our hearts we raise
in joyful adoration;
with saints above we hymn thy praise
in notes of exultation;
they, round thy throne a shining throng,
stand, thy dread might confessing:
we at thy feet pour forth our song,
and humbly seek thy blessing.
To thy great glory, Lord, we place,
within thy shrine most holy,
these hallowed gifts, thy courts to grace,
with thankful hearts and lowly.
Accept, we pray, these works of love,
and seal them thine for ever:
thy gracious unction from above
pour thou on gifts and giver.
Fountain of good and God of love,
dwelling in light supernal;
of all thy gifts from heaven above,
grant us the life eternal.
And when within this shrine we kneel,
our sacred Master meeting,
O may our hearts his presence feel,
and joy in heavenly greeting.
God of our fathers, thee we hail,
one God from everlasting,
while saints their crowns within the veil
before thy throne are casting.
On us and ours, O Lord, we pray,
in joy and in affliction,
shed forth thy Spirit day by day
in hallowing benediction.

Great God, we praise your mighty love
which urges us to rise above
constricting doubts and fears;
your purpose is to set us free
to live our lives creatively
throughout the coming years.
We praise you for the love we see
in husband, wife, and family,
in friends and neighbors too;
the love which nurtured us from birth,
the love which teaches human worth,
and lifts our minds to you.
We praise you most for love supreme
which breaks through pain and death to stream
in unrestricted light;
which from Christ's resurrection dawn 
has shone, and never been withdrawn,
to make our future bright.
For by your perfect love refined,
our own will not be undermined
by futile guilt and shame;
but through disaster, grief, and strife
we'll reaffirm the joy of life
and glorify your name.

Great God, your love has called us here
as we, by love, for love were made.
Your living likeness still we bear,
though marred, dishonored, disobeyed.
We come, with all our heart and mind,
your call to hear, your love to find.
We come with self-inflicted pains
of broken trust and chosen wrong;
half-free, half-bound by inner chains;
by social forces swept along,
by powers and systems close confined;
yet seeking hope for humankind.
Great God, in Christ you call our name
and then receive us as your own
not through some merit, right, or claim,
but by your gracious love alone.
We strain to glimpse your mercy seat
and find you kneeling at our feet.
Then take the towel, and break the bread,
and humble us, and call us friends.
Suffer and serve till all are fed,
and show how grandly love intends
to work till all creation sings,
to fill all worlds, to crown all things.
Great God, in Christ you set us free,
your life to live, your joy to share.
Give your Spirit's liberty
to turn from guilt and dull despair
and offer all that faith can do
while love is making all things new.

Great God, a blessing from Your throne
Grant us who lay this cornerstone,
To build a church in which Your Word
Is purely taught and gladly heard.
The work is Yours and not our own;
Oh, come, and make Your presence known;
Our prayers accept, our off’ring bless,
Our labors crown with due success.
We are the people of Your choice,
And while we in this grace rejoice,
Our prayer is this, our constant care,
That others too our bliss may share.
Lord, here erect a blessed home
Where Christ will ever bid us come,
From Him receiving grace for grace
Till we behold You face to face.

Great God! Beneath Whose piercing eye
The earth’s extended kingdoms lie;
Whose favoring smile upholds them all,
Whose anger smites them, and they fall.
We bow before Thy heavenly throne;
Thy power we see, Thy greatness own;
Yet, cherished by Thy milder voice,
Our bosoms tremble and rejoice.
Thy kindness to our fathers shown
Their children’s children long shall own;
To Thee, with grateful hearts, shall raise
The tribute of exulting praise.
Led on by Thine unerring aid,
Secure the paths of life we tread;
And, freely as the vital air,
Thy first and noblest bounties share.
Great God, our Guardian, Guide and Friend!
O still Thy sheltering arm extend;
Preserved by Thee for ages past,
For ages let Thy kindness last!

Great God, how infinite art Thou!
What worthless worms are we!
Let the whole race of creatures bow,
And pay their praise to Thee.
Thy throne eternal ages stood,
Ere seas or stars were made:
Thou art the ever living God,
Were all the nations dead.
Nature and time quite naked lie
To Thine immense survey,
From the formation of the sky
To the great burning day.
Eternity, with all its years,
Stands present in Thy view;
To Thee there’s nothing old appears;
Great God! There’s nothing new.
Our lives through various scenes are drawn,
And vexed with trifling cares;
While Thine eternal thought moves on
Thine undisturbed affairs.
Great God, how infinite art Thou!
What worthless worms are we!
Let the whole race of creatures bow,
And pay their praise to Thee.

Great God, I own Thy sentence just,
And nature must decay;
I yield my body to the dust,
To dwell with fellow clay.
Yet faith may triumph o’er the grave,
And trample on the tombs;
My Jesus, my Redeemer, lives;
My God, my Savior, comes.
The mighty Conqueror shall appear
High on a royal seat,
And death, the last of all His foes,
Lie vanquished at His feet.
Though greedy worms devour my skin,
And gnaw my wasting flesh,
When God shall build my bones again,
He clothes them all afresh.
Then shall I see Thy lovely face
With strong immortal eyes;
And feast upon Thy unknown grace
With pleasure and surprise.

Great God, indulge my humble claim,
Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest;
The glories that compose Thy Name
Stand all engaged to make me blest.
Thou great and good, thou just and wise,
Thou art my Father and my God;
And I am Thine by sacred ties;
Thy son, Thy servant, bought with blood.
With heart, and eyes, and lifted hands,
For Thee I long, to Thee I look,
As travelers in thirsty lands
Pant for the cooling water brook.
With early feet I love t’ appear
Among Thy saints, and seek Thy face;
Oft have I seen Thy glory there,
And felt the power of sovereign grace.
Not fruits nor wines that tempt our taste,
Nor all the joys our senses know,
Could make me so divinely blest,
Or raise my cheerful passions so.
My life itself without Thy love
No taste of pleasure could afford;
’Twould but a tiresome burden prove,
If I were banished from the Lord.
Amidst the wakeful hours of night,
When busy cares afflict my head,
One thought of Thee gives new delight,
And adds refreshment to my bed.
I’ll lift my hands, I’ll raise my voice,
While I have breath to pray or praise;
This work shall make my heart rejoice,
And spend the remnant of my days.

Great God, we give Thee praise
For all Thy wondrous grace
Thy wise and ever loving ways
To all our favored race.
Thou hast Thy love revealed
Beyond what prophets knew;
Thy holy Book of truth unsealed
To our astonished view.
We wander now no more
Where darkening errors lead,
But truth by light divine explore,
And wonder while we read.
Lord, we adore Thy Name
For light and truth divine!
From Thee the welcomed mercies came,
And be the glory Thine.

Great God, we sing Your mighty hand
By which supported still we stand;
The opening year Your mercy shows,
That mercy crowns it ’til its close.
By day, by night, at home, abroad,
Still are we guarded by our God,
By His incessant bounty fed,
By His unerring counsel led.
With grateful hearts the past we own;
The future, all to us unknown,
We to Thy guardian care commit,
And peaceful leave before Thy feet.
In scenes exalted or depressed,
You are our joy, and You our rest;
Your goodness all our hopes shall raise,
Adored through all our changing days.
When death shall interrupt our songs
And seal in silence mortal tongues,
In fairer realms, O God, shall we
Your praises sing eternally.

Great God, what do I see and hear?
The end of things created!
The Judge of mankind doth appear,
On clouds of glory seated.
The trumpet sounds, the graves restore,
The dead which they contained before!
Prepare, my soul, to meet Him.
The dead in Christ shall first arise
At the last trumpet’s sounding.
Caught up to meet Him in the skies,
With joy their Lord surrounding.
No gloomy fears their souls dismay,
His presence sheds eternal day
On those prepared to meet Him.
But sinners, filled with guilty fears,
Behold His wrath prevailing.
In woe they rise, but all their tears
And sighs are unavailing.
The day of grace is past and gone;
Trembling they stand before His throne,
All unprepared to meet Him.
Great God, to Thee my spirit clings,
Thy boundless love declaring.
One wondrous sight my comfort brings,
The Judge my nature wearing.
Beneath His cross I view the day
When Heav’n and earth shall pass away,
And thus prepare to meet Him.

Great God, Whose universal sway
The known and unknown worlds obey,
Now give the kingdom to Thy Son,
Extend His power, exalt His throne.
Thy scepter well becomes His hands,
All Heav’n submits to His commands;
His justice shall avenge the poor,
And pride and rage prevail no more.
With power He vindicates the just,
And treads th’oppressor in the dust;
His worship and His fear shall last,
Till hours, and years, and time be past.
As rain on meadows newly mown,
So shall He send His influence down;
His grace on fainting souls distils,
Like heav’nly dew on thirsty hills.
The heathen lands that lie beneath
The shades of overspreading death,
Revive at His first dawning light,
And deserts blossom at the sight.
The saints shall flourish in His days,
Dressed in the robes of joy and praise
Peace, like a river from His throne,
Shall flow to nations yet unknown.

Praise him you heavens and all that's above
Praise him you angels and heavenly hosts
Let the whole earth praise him
Praise him the sun, moon and bright shinning stars
Praise him you heavens and waters and skies
Let the whole earth praise him
Great in power, great in glory
Great in mercy, king of heaven
Great in battle, great in wonder
Great in Zion, king over all the earth

Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise,
The city of our God, the holy place,
The joy of the whole earth.
Great is the Lord in whom we have the victory
He aids us against the enemy.
We bow down on our knees.
And Lord we want to lift Your Name on high,
And Lord we want to thank You
For the works You've done in our lives.
And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love;
For You alone are God eternal,
Throughout earth and heaven above.

Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise,
The city of our God, the holy place,
The joy of the whole earth.
Great is the Lord in whom we have the victory
He aids us against the enemy.
We bow down on our knees.
And Lord we want to lift Your Name on high,
And Lord we want to thank You
For the works You've done in our lives.
And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love;
For You alone are God eternal,
Throughout earth and heaven above.

Great is the Lord our God,
And let His praise be great;
He makes His churches His abode,
His most delightful seat.
Those temples of His grace,
How beautiful they stand!
The honors of our native place,
And bulwarks of our land.
In Sion God is known,
A refuge in distress;
How bright has His salvation shone
Through all her palaces!
When kings against her joined,
And saw the Lord was there,
In wild confusion of the mind,
They fled with hasty fear.
When navies tall and proud
Attempt to spoil our peace,
He sends His tempests roaring loud,
And sinks them in the seas.
Oft have our fathers told,
Our eyes have often seen,
How well our God secures the fold
Where His own sheep have been.
In every new distress
We’ll to His house repair;
We’ll think upon His wondrous grace,
And seek deliverance there.

Great is your mercy, Lord
Great is your love
Great is your mercy, Lord
Great is your love
Unto you
I will lift up my voice
With my mouth
Make your faithfulness known
Oh Lord, your word stands true forever
And with a grateful heart
I bow before your throne

I’M THINKING TODAY OF MY HOME FAR AWAY
THAT JESUS IS BUILDING FOR ME
WHEN IT’S DONE I’LL RECEIVE A BLESSING FOR ME 
AND THE WONDERS OF HEAVEN I’LL SEE
I’LL SEE MY SAVIOR WHO DIED IN MY PLACE
WHAT A JOY TO BEHOLD HIS DEAR FACE
I’LL SEE MY MANSION SO STATELY AND TALL
AND THE DIAMONDS ON THAT GREAT JASPER WALL
MY JOURNEY WILL BE SO PLEASANT TO ME
NO MORE BAGGAGE NO MONEY I’LL NEED
RESERVATIONS ARE MADE WAITING FOR ME THERE
MY TRIP WILL BE PERFECT INDEED
I’LL SEE MY SAVOIR WHO DIED IN MY PLACE
WHAT A JOY TO BEHOLD HIS DEAR FACE
I’LL SEE MY MANSION SO STATELY AND TALL
AND THE DIAMONDS ON THAT GREAT JASPER WALL

Great Jehovah, mighty Lord,
Vast and boundless is Thy Word;
King of kings, from shore to shore
Thou shalt reign forevermore.
Jew and Gentile, bond and free,
All shall yet be one in Thee;
All confess Messiah’s Name,
All His wondrous love proclaim.
From her night shall China wake,
Afric’s sons their chains shall break;
Egypt, where Thy people trod,
Shall adore and praise our God.
India’s groves of palms so fair
Shall resound with praise and prayer;
Ceylon’s isle with joy shall sing,
Glory be to Christ our King.
North and South shall own Thy sway;
East and West Thy voice obey;
Crowns and thrones before Thee fall,
King of kings and Lord of all.

I dreamed that the Great Judgement Morning,
had Dawned, and the trumpet had (DBlown,
I Dreamed that all nations had Gathered,
to Judgement be- (Dfore the White Throne.
From the throne came a bright shining angel,
and he stood on the land and the (DSea,
and swore with his hand raised to heaven,
that time was no (Dlonger to be.
And oh what weeping and wailing,
as the lost were told of their (Dfate,
they cried for the rocks and the mountains,
they prayed, but their (Dprayers were too late.
The rich man was there but his money,
had melted and vanished away,
A pauper stood there in the judgement,
his debts were too many to pay.
The great man was there, but his greatness,
when death came, was left far behind,
The angel that opened the records,
no trace of his greatness could find.
The widow was there and the orphan,
God heard and remembered their cries,
no sorrow in heaven forever,
God wiped all the tears from their eyes.
The gambler was there and the drunkard,
and they who had sold them the drink,
with people who gave them the license,
together in hell they did sink.
The mortal man to the judgement,
but self rightousness would not do,
for the men who had crucified jesus,
had passed off as mortal men too.
And the souls that had put off salvation,
not tonight I'll get saved by and by,
no time now to think of religion,
at last they had found time to die.

Great King of glory, come,
And with Thy favor crown
This temple as Thy home,
This people as Thine own;
Beneath this roof, O deign to show
How God can dwell with men below.
In sweet, exalted strains
The King of glory praise;
O’er Heav’n and earth He reigns
Through everlasting days;
He, with a nod, the world controls
Sustains or sinks the distant poles.
To earth He bends His throne,
His throne of grace divine;
Wide is His bounty known,
And wide His glories shine;
Fair Salem still His chosen rest
Is with His smiles and presence blest.
Here may Thine ears attend
Our interceding cries,
And grateful praise ascend,
Like incense, to the skies:
Here may Thy Word melodious sound,
And spread celestial joys around.
Here may our unborn sons
And daughters sound Thy praise,
And shine, like polished stones,
Through long succeeding days;
Here, Lord, display Thy saving power,
While temples stand and men adore.
Here may the listening throng
Receive Thy truth in love;
Here Christians join the song
Of seraphim above;
Till all, who humbly seek Thy face,
Rejoice in Thy abounding grace.

Great King of nations, hear our prayer,
While at Thy feet we fall,
And humbly with united cry
To Thee for mercy call;
The guilt is ours, but grace is Thine,
O turn us not away;
But hear us from Thy lofty throne,
And help us when we pray.
Our fathers’ sins were manifold,
And ours no less we own,
Yet wondrously from age to age
Thy goodness has been shown;
When dangers, like a stormy sea,
Beset our country round,
To Thee we looked, to Thee we cried,
And help in Thee was found.
With one consent we meekly bow
Beneath Thy chastening hand,
And, pouring forth confession meet,
Mourn with our mourning land;
With pitying eye behold our need,
As thus we lift our prayer;
Correct us with Thy judgments, Lord,
Then let Thy mercy spare.

Guide me, O thou great Redeemer,
pilgrim though this barren land;
I am weak, but thou art mighty;
hold me with thy powerful hand;
Bread of heaven,
feed me now and evermore.
Open now the crystal fountain,
whence the healing stream doth flow;
let the fiery cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through;
strong Deliverer,
be thou still my Strength and Shield.
When I tread the verge of Jordan,
bid my anxious fears subside;
bear me through the swelling current,
land me safe on Canaan's side;
songs of praises,
I will ever give to thee.

Great Mover of all hearts, Whose hand
Doth all the secret springs command
Of human thought and will,
Thou, since the world was made, dost bless
Thy saints with fruits of holiness,
Their order to fulfill.
Faith, hope, and love here weave one chain;
But love alone shall then remain
When this short day is gone:
O Love, O Truth, O endless Light,
When shall we see Thy Sabbath bright
With all our labors done?
We sow ’mid perils here and tears;
There the glad hand the harvest bears,
Which here in grief hath sown:
Great Three in One, the increase give;
Thy gifts of grace, by which we live,
With heavenly glory crown.

The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus;
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest Name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.
Your many sins are all forgiv’n,
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to Heav’n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.
All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Savior’s Name,
I love the Name of Jesus.
The children, too, both great and small,
Who love the Name of Jesus,
May now accept the gracious call
To work and live for Jesus.
Come, brethren, help me sing His praise,
Oh, praise the Name of Jesus;
Oh, sisters, all your voices raise,
Oh, bless the Name of Jesus.
His Name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus;
Oh! how my soul delights to hear
The charming Name of Jesus.
And when to that bright world above,
We rise to see our Jesus,
We’ll sing around the throne of love
His Name, the Name of Jesus.

Great Shepherd of Thy chosen flock,
Thy people’s Shield, their shadowing Rock,
Once more we meet to hear Thy voice,
Once more before Thee to rejoice.
Now may Thy Spirit, by the Word,
Refresh each wearied heart, O Lord,
Wearied of earth’s vain strife and woe,
And longing more Thyself to know.
Thine is the heart our griefs to feel,
And Thine the love each wound to heal;
Home Thou art gone for us to care,
Returning soon to take us there.

Great Shepherd of thy people, hear;
thy presence now display;
as thou hast given a place for prayer,
so give us hearts to pray.
Within these walls let holy peace
and love and concord dwell;
here give the troubled conscience ease;
the wounded spirit heal.
May we in faith receive thy Word,
in faith address our prayers;
and in the presence of the Lord
unbosom all our cares.
The hearing ear, the seeing eye,
the contrite heart bestow;
and shine upon us from on high,
that we in grace may grow.

Great Shepherd, Who leadest Thy people in love,
’Mid cherubim dwelling, shine Thou from above;
In might come and save us, Thy people restore,
And we shall be saved when Thy face shines once more.
O haste, Lord, to hear us and pity our woes,
Afflictions our portion, despised by our foes;
O Lord God Almighty, in mercy restore,
And we shall be saved when Thy face shines once more.
A place for Thy people, Thou, Lord, didst prepare,
Thy vine deeply rooted rewarded Thy care;
Its branches like cedars, majestic and free,
Spread over the mountains from river to sea.
Thy vineyard no longer Thy tender care knows,
Defenseless, the victim and spoil of her foes;
O turn, we beseech Thee, all glory is Thine,
Look down in Thy mercy and visit Thy vine.
The branch of Thy planting is burned and cut down,
Brought nigh to destruction because of Thy frown;
The man of Thy right hand with wisdom endue,
The son of man strengthen Thy pleasure to do.
When Thou shalt revive us Thy Name we shall praise,
And nevermore turning, depart from Thy ways;
O Lord God Almighty, in mercy restore,
And we shall be saved when Thy face shines once more.

Great Source of unexhausted good,
Who givest us health and friends and food
And peace and calm content;
Like fragrant incense, to the skies,
Let songs of grateful praises rise
For all Thy blessings lent.
Through all the dangers of the day,
Thy providence attends our way,
To guard us and to guide;
Thy grace directs our wandering will,
And warns us, lest seducing ill
Allure our souls aside.
To Thee our lives, our all, we owe,
Our peace and sweetest joys below,
And brightest hopes above;
Then let our lives, and all that’s ours,
Our souls, and all our active powers,
Be sacred to Thy love.

What a beautiful thought I am thinking,
Concerning a great speckled bird.
Remember her name is recorded,
On the pages of God's Holy Word.
All the other birds flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad.
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great Church of God.
All other churches are against her,
They envy her glory and fame.
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.
Desiring to lower her standard,
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings,
But really they find no mistake.
She is spreading her wings for a journey.
She's going to leave by and by;
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning,
She'll rise and go up in the sky.
In the presence of all her despisers,
With a song never uttered before,
She will rise and be gone in a moment
'Til the great tribulation is o'er.
I am glad I have learned of her meekness.
I am proud that my name is on her book,
For I want to be one never fearing
On the face of my Savior to look.
When He cometh descending from heaven,
On a cloud like He writes in His Word,
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird

Thou, the great, eternal God,
Art high above our thought!
Worthy to be feared, adored,
By all Thy hands have wrought:
None can with Thyself compare;
Thy glory fills both earth and sky;
We, and all thy creatures, are
As nothing in Thine eyes.
Of Thy great unbounded power
To Thee the praise we give,
Infinitely great, and more
Than heart can e’er conceive:
When Thou wilt to work proceed,
Thy purpose firm none can withstand,
Frustrate the determined deed,
Or stay the almighty hand.
Thou, our God, art wise alone;
Thy counsel doth excel;
Wonderful Thy works we own,
Thy ways unsearchable;
Who can sound the mystery,
Thy judgments’ deep abyss explain,
Thine, whose eyes in darkness see,
And search the heart of man?

Long ago
Even before you made the world
You chose me
Through what Christ would do
A greater grace
You gave to me
You are the Source
And Jesus is the means
Forgiveness
Adoption
Acceptance
Is your grace
And I fall on my face
And I yeild to you

When in Jesus we believe, and His pardon we receive,
What a comfort to the soul the promise brings;
That the weary and oppressed, when they come to Him for rest,
He will cover with the shadow of His wings.
O sing the greatness of His mercy,
Unto those that seek Him ever full and free;
O sing, while angels join the ,
Rolling onward like the sea.
When in Jesus we abide, and by faith are justified,
We have peace with God the Father through His Name;
And the joy that fills the heart, though its earthly hopes depart,
Through His all atoning merit we may claim.
When in Jesus we are one we can say, His will be done,
We can trust Him where perhaps we cannot trace;
For he keeps us by His power, every moment, every hour,
And we feel the sweet refreshing of His grace.
Oh, the whispers of His love, how they cheer us from above,
While they tell of yonder mansions bright and fair;
Where, beyond the swelling tide, we shall anchor at His side,
And be gathered with the saints in glory there.

Trouble and trials often betray those
On in the weary body to stray
But we shall walk beside the still waters
With the good shepherd leading the way
Those who have strayed were sought by the Master
He who once gave His life for the sheep
Out on the mountain still He is seaching
Bringing them in forever to keep
Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die never more
Even the Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that heavenly shore
We will not heed the voice of a stranger
For he would lead us all to despair
Following on with Jesus our savior
We shall all reach that country so fair
Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die never more
Even the Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that heavenly shore

How tedious and tasteless the hours
When Jesus no longer I see;
Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flowers,
Have all lost their sweetness to me;
The midsummer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay;
But when I am happy in him,
December's as pleasant as May.
His name yields the richest perfume,
And sweeter than music his voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice;
I should, were he always thus nigh,
Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal so happy as I,
My summer would last all the year.
Content with beholding his face,
My all to his pleasure resigned,
No changes of season or place
Would make any change in my mind:
While blest with a sense of his love,
A palace a toy would appear;
And prisons would palaces prove,
If Jesus would dwell with me there.
Dear Lord, if indeed I am thine,
If thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I languish and pine?
And why are my winters so long?
O drive these dark clouds from my sky,
Thy soul cheering presence restore;
Or take me to thee up on high,
Where winter and clouds are no more.

Won't you listen to what I've got to say to you
It could be wrong but then again it could be true
And if it's true, you need to take a second look 
Just to see if what I'm telling you is by The Book
You see, now many declare that they are preachin' the word
And though they may sound mighty pretty what they say's absurd
I'm am not eloquent, I know I may sound rough
I'm just tryin' to make a simple point -- It's not enough 
It's not enough to be livin' by simple rules
It's not enough to be sittin' in Sunday school
It's not enough to be actively takin' part
If you don't have Jesus in your heart 
It's not enuff! (x
Well, I hope you don't mind if I will say it again
My only motive is to help you 'cause you are my friend
And if you are my friend, you would say it to me
To help me understand the truth I want to see
Although I want to see, often my sight is fuzzy
When I focus on myself, I fall and stumble
'Cause he brings me down when I believe that I'm so tough
For who I am and what I've done, it's not enough 
It's not enuff! (x
(Sing it AVB.)
It's not enuff!
It's not enuff! (What did you say?)
It's not enuff! (I can't believe you believe that!)
It's not enuff! (All right, then!)
It's not enuff! (No, no, no, no)
It's not enuff!
It's not enuff! (It's not? It's not? I said it's not!)
It's not enuff! 
It's not enuff! 

Vs.Grow old along with me, the best is yet to be.
When our time has come we will be as one.
God bless our love, God bless our love.
Vs.Grow old along with me, two branches of one tree.
Face the setting sun when the day is done.
God bless our love, God bless our love.
(Bridge)
Spending our lives together; Man and wife together
World without end, world without end.
Vs.Grow old along with me, whatever life decrees.
We will see it through for our love is true.
God bless our love, God bless our love.

Lord, you're the keeper of what you grow
You water, you guard, for fruit to show;
for mercy and justice to flow.
You planted the vineyard, our needs you know.
Grow something new in our lives, oh God.
Grow something peaceful, grow something true.
Grow something new in our lives, oh God.
Grow something new, turn our hope back to you.
You broke down the wall of hostility.
You bring us near you so we can see
who you want us to be:
Not many but one for eternity.
Grow something new in our lives, oh God.
Grow something peaceful, grow something true.
Grow something new in our lives, oh God.
Grow something new, turn our hope back to you.

I'm growin' up in the Lord.
Oh I'm gettin' stronger; turnin' back no longer: 
I'm growin' up in the Lord.
I'm growin' up in the Lord.
I make mistakes but that's part of growin' up.
Part of growin' up in the Lord.
His understanding is what I need the most, 
I am staying close to His word.
Sheltered from harm when I am safe in his arms 
And I am learning to do His will.
Hearing his call although I stumble and fall.
I can get up and keep growing still.
Now as I'm growin' I'm learning what to say,
Learning how to walk in the light.
I'm made aware of the devil every day 
Learning how to handle the fight.
Tempted by wrong, He keeps me ready and strong
So I can handle the Tempter's snare.
Jesus is mine and since he's there all the time
I am protected within His care 
I'm growin' up in the, growin' up in the, I'm growin' up in the Lord.

I grew up with King James
I read it in my youth
I read it in my Sunday school
It's how I learned the truth
Learning to decipher
Elizabethan voice
Newer versions came along
And now I have a choice! 
Growin' up with King James
Learning "thees" and "thous"
Learning the unwritten rules
That the church allows
Growin' up with King James
Hard to understand
What the language means to me
Say who is this man?
King James
King James 
Back when it brand new
The lingo it was prime
It's safe to say that century
Was way before my time
When it comes to versions
Which is the one for me?
I can honestly declare
It's not the KJV! (Hey!) 
No, we are not sayin' (can't say it's bad) 
The KJV is bad (it's bad, it's bad, it's bad)
Countless souls came to the Lord
The only choice they had (only choice they had)
If you're tryin' to tell me (The only one)
That's it's the only one (The only one)
That would mean Jehovah God would be an Englishman 
Say who art thou man?
King James (Who is this man?)
King James
James
King James 

How sweet is the love of my Savior!
’Tis boundless and deep as the sea;
And best of it all, it is daily
Growing sweeter and sweeter to me.
Sweeter and sweeter to me,
Dearer and dearer each day;
Oh, wonderful love of my Savior,
Growing dearer each step of my way!
I know He is ever beside me!
Eternity only will prove
The height and the depth of His mercy,
And the breadth of His infinite love.
Wherever He leads I will follow,
Thru sorrow, or shadow or sun;
And though I be tried in the furnace,
I can say, “Lord, Thy will be it done."
Some day face to face I shall see Him,
And oh, what a joy it will be
To know that His love, now so precious,
Will forever grow sweeter to me!

With Thine eye, O Savior, guide me
Through my pilgrimage below;
In Thy secret presence hide me,
On my heart Thy grace bestow.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
May I feel that Thou art nigh;
Let me rest upon Thy promise,
“I will guide Thee with mine eye." 
Guide me when the shadows o’er me
To my vision dark appear;
Let me see my way before me,
As at noonday bright and clear.
Guide my thoughts lest they should wander
To the empty dreams of earth;
Let me on Thy goodness ponder,
Yea, on things of heav’nly worth.
Guide my words that they be spoken
In such kind and loving way;
They may heal a heart that’s broken,
Someone’s darkness turn to day.
Guide my actions, O my Father,
Guide my soul to heaven’s shore;
Thee I’ll follow and no other,
Be my guide forevermore.

Guide me, O thou great Redeemer,
pilgrim though this barren land;
I am weak, but thou art mighty;
hold me with thy powerful hand;
Bread of heaven,
feed me now and evermore.
Open now the crystal fountain,
whence the healing stream doth flow;
let the fiery cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through;
strong Deliverer,
be thou still my Strength and Shield.
When I tread the verge of Jordan,
bid my anxious fears subside;
bear me through the swelling current,
land me safe on Canaan's side;
songs of praises,
I will ever give to thee.

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
[or Guide me, O Thou great Redeemer…]
Pilgrim through this barren land.
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
Hold me with Thy powerful hand.
Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven,
Feed me till I want no more;
Feed me till I want no more.
Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fire and cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through.
Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield;
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.
Lord, I trust Thy mighty power,
Wondrous are Thy works of old;
Thou deliver’st Thine from thralldom,
Who for naught themselves had sold:
Thou didst conquer, Thou didst conquer,
Sin, and Satan and the grave,
Sin, and Satan and the grave.
When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of deaths, and hell’s destruction,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side.
Songs of praises, songs of praises,
I will ever give to Thee;
I will ever give to Thee.
Musing on my habitation,
Musing on my heav’nly home,
Fills my soul with holy longings:
Come, my Jesus, quickly come;
Vanity is all I see;
Lord, I long to be with Thee!
Lord, I long to be with Thee!

Our Father guides His people
Our Father makes a way
Our Father comes to dwell in us
(Father) And teach us what to say 
Guide us in Your truth, Lord
Guide us on our way
Guide us to Your holy dwelling
Guide us everyday
Guide us for Your name's sake
Guide us in Your light
Guide us to Your holy mountain
Guide us day and night
Guide us in Your wisdom
Guide us with Your hand
Guide us by the springs of water
(Guide us) To that promised land 
Oh, Our Savior guides His people
Our Savior makes a way
Our Savior comes to dwell in us
(Savior) And teach us what to say 
The Spirit guides His people
The Spirit makes a way
The Spirit comes to dwell in us
(Spirit) And teach us what to say 
Jesus guides His people
(Oh my) Jesus makes a way
(Oh my) Jesus comes to dwell in us
(Oh my Jesus) And tell us what to say 
Oh, Spirit guide Your people
Spirit make a way
Spirit comes and dwell in us
And tell us what to say 
Guide us 

Through each perplexing care and strife,
That marks the checkered path of life,
My Savior’s guiding hand I see,
And know that still He leadeth me.
He leadeth me, he leadeth me,
Let this my theme of rapture be!
He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
My Savior’s guiding hand I see.
Though trials great before me rise,
Though clouds of sorrow veil my skies,
Unmoved the coming storm I see,
For God my Savior leadeth me.
He leadeth me, O joy divine!
The glory His, the cross be mine,
Since He who suffered on the tree
In tender mercy leadeth me.
With Him, my soul’s eternal Guide,
What can I wish or want beside?
In life or death my song shall be,
My loving Savior leadeth me.

There’s a sacred and hallowed retreat,
Where my soul finds a fellowship sweet,
Where the Lord of my life I may meet,
In the garden of my heart.
In the cool of the day He walks with me,
In the rose bordered way He talks with me;
In love’s holy union,
And sacred communion,
In the garden of my heart.
There is naught can disturb or molest,
There my spirit finds comfort and rest,
And my soul is no longer distressed
In the garden of my heart.
Shut away from earth’s strife and its din,
And protected from soul staining sin,
For my Savior is dwelling within,
In the garden of my heart.
There the dove of sweet peace always sings,
And my faith ever trustingly clings;
And the chime of sweet happiness rings
In the garden of my heart.

There is a gate that stands ajar,
And through its portals gleaming
A radiance from the cross afar,
The Savior’s love revealing.
O depth of mercy! Can it be
That gate was left ajar for me?
For me! For me!
Was left ajar for me!
That gate ajar stands free for all
Who seek through it salvation;
The rich and poor, the great and small,
Of every tribe and nation.
Press onward, then, though foes may frown,
While mercy’s gate is open;
Accept the cross, and win the crown,
Love’s everlasting token.
Beyond the river’s brink we’ll lay
The cross that here is given,
And bear the crown of life away,
And love Him more in Heaven.

The gathering clouds, with aspect dark,
A rising storm presage;
O! to be hid within the ark,
And sheltered from its rage!
See the commissioned angel frown!
That vial in his hand,
Filled with fierce wrath, is pouring down
Upon our guilty land!
Ye saints, unite in wrestling prayer;
If yet there may be hope;
Who knows but Mercy yet may spare,
And bid the angel stop!
Already is the plague begun,
And fired with hostile rage;
Brethren, by blood and interest one,
With brethren now engage.
Peace spreads her wings, prepared for flight,
And war, with flaming sword,
And hasty strides draws nigh, to fight
The battles of the Lord.
The first alarm, alas, how few,
While distant, seem to hear!
But they will hear, and tremble too,
When God shall send it near.
So thunder, o’er the distant hills,
Gives but a murm’ring sound,
But as the tempest spreads, it fills,
And makes the welkin sound.
May we, at least, with one consent,
Fall low before the throne
With tears the nation’s sins lament,
The churches, and our own.
The humble souls who mourn and pray,
The Lord approves and knows;
His mark secures them in the day
When vengeance strikes his foes.

Though I may speak with bravest fire,
And have the gift to all inspire,
And have not love, my words are vain,
As sounding brass, and hopeless gain.
Though I may give all I possess,
And striving so my love profess,
But not be given by love within,
The profit soon turns strangely thin.
Come, Spirit, come, our hearts control,
Our spirits long to be made whole.
Let inward love guide every deed;
By this we worship, and are freed.

The glorious gates of righteousness
Throw open unto me,
And I will enter them with praise,
O Lord, my God, to Thee,
And I will enter them with praise,
O Lord, my God, to Thee.
This is Thy temple gate, O Lord,
The just shall enter there;
My Savior, I will give Thee thanks,
O Thou, that hearest prayer,
My Savior, I will give Thee thanks,
O Thou, that hearest prayer.
The stone rejected and despised
Is now the cornerstone;
How wondrous are the ways of God,
Unfathomed and unknown!
How wondrous are the ways of God,
Unfathomed and unknown!
In this the day that Thou hast made
Triumphantly we sing;
Send now prosperity, O Lord,
O Lord, salvation bring,
Send now prosperity, O Lord,
O Lord, salvation bring.
Hosanna! Ever blest be he
That cometh in God’s Name;
The blessing of Jehovah’s house
Upon you we proclaim;
The blessing of Jehovah’s house
Upon you we proclaim.
The light of joy to shine on us
The Lord our God has made;
Now be the precious sacrifice
Upon His altar laid;
Now be the precious sacrifice
Upon His altar laid.
O Lord, my God, I praise Thy Name,
All others names above;
O give Him thanks, for He is good
And boundless is His love;
O give Him thanks, for He is good
And boundless is His love.
O praise the Lord, for He is good;
Let all in Heav’n above
And all His saints on earth proclaim
His everlasting love;
And all His saints on earth proclaim
His everlasting love.

Are you at your station ready,
For the near approaching train?
Are you fully contemplating
That a pass you will obtain?
Is there some important matter,
You have left behind undone,
That will keep you hesitating,
Till too late to make the run?
O be ready for the glorious Gospel train,
Quickly make your preparation,
And your passport have in hand;
O be ready for the glorious Gospel train,
It will take you safely over,
To the glory spirit land.
Has your title been recorded,
That no question can be made?
Does your preparation warrant,
That you shall not be delayed?
When you see the headlight gleamings,
As around the curves they climb,
Have you any fears and doubtings,
That you’ll not get in on time?
Are your garments nicely fitted,
That accepted you may be,
As a guest on board for Heaven,
Trav’ling for eternity?
Do you hold the bloodstained banner,
Of Emmanuel in your hand,
With your claims inscribed upon it,
And a ride for Heav’n demand?
’Tis the only signal, brother,
That will make your passage sure,
That will stop the mighty engine,
And a seat to you secure;
That will give you close connection,
And a never failing hand,
That will take you safely over,
To the glory spirit land.
