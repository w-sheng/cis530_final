A babe lies in the cradle,<br/>
a little babe so dear,<br/>
with noble light he shineth<br/>
as shines a mirror clear,<br/>
this little babe so dear.<br/>
<br/>
The babe within the cradle<br/>
is Jesus Christ our Lord;<br/>
to us all peace and amity<br/>
at this good time afford,<br/>
thou Jesus Christ our Lord!<br/>
<br/>
Whoso would rock the cradle<br/>
where lies the gentle child,<br/>
a lowly heart must lead him,<br/>
by passions undefiled,<br/>
as Mary pure and mild.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, babe beloved!<br/>
O Jesus, babe divine!<br/>
How mighty is thy wondrous love!<br/>
Fill thou this heart of mine<br/>
with that great love of thine!

Years 
have flown by, memories have remained, <br/>
I've gone through situations that no one can explain, <br/>
I thought in my mind that this would never attend, <br/>
I have gone through the loss of a very close friend, <br/>
Trying to be strong and hold back the tears, <br/>
walking by others who have a face of fear, <br/>
With arms wide open and love poured out , <br/>
This could be the end I have no doubt, <br/>
I don't know where to go or what to do, I<br/>
 can't let go of the things I'm going through...... <br/>
<br/>
Pain and Fear is always in my way, <br/>
It hurts to know all the things in life that change, <br/>
Good or Bad... You'll always become stronger, <br/>
Let God take control.... For he will make you whole, <br/>
He is your life and living water, <br/>
Even a loving Father, <br/>
He'll make you have a Better Day..... <br/>
<br/>
I went to school that very next day, <br/>
It was hard to realize that life was so short away, <br/>
It was just so hard to see, My heart was beating so quickly, <br/>
they were their one minute gone the next, <br/>
The bell rang we all went to class, <br/>
Not a word was spoken it went by so fast, <br/>
We all bowed our heads tears rolled down our eyes, <br/>
For God was with us right by our sides, <br/>
I just can't explain, just can't explain the way I feel..... <br/>
<br/>
Pain and Fear is always in my way, <br/>
It hurts to know all the things in life that change, <br/>
Good or Bad.... You'll always become stronger, <br/>
Let God take control.... For he will make you whole, <br/>
He is your life and living water, <br/>
Even a loving Father, <br/>
He'll make you have a better day.... <br/>
<br/>
For He will make you whole, <br/>
and it will be a Better Day....... A Better Day.... <br/>

1) When I came into this world, I just can't recall<br/>
I don't remember anything about my birth at all<br/>
But one day, on my knees in prayer, I just never will forget<br/>
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
<br/>
Oh, but to the world it made no difference,<br/>
Some might even frown<br/>
But the angels, they rejoiced,<br/>
When my name was written down<br/>
Unworthy of His mercy, but yet He paid the debt<br/>
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Well, it never made the papers, it never made the evening news<br/>
When I took off the old man, and I put on the new<br/>
My sins were cast into forgetfulness, as the East is from the West<br/>
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget<br/>

I once was an outcast stranger on earth,<br/>
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,<br/>

An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown. <br/>

Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:<br/>
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King. <br/>

How sweet to know that tho' his footsteps waver<br/>
His faithful Lord is walking by his side!<br/>

O give us homes with godly fathers, mothers,<br/>
Who always place their hope and trust in Him;<br/>
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,<br/>
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;<br/>
A home where each finds joy in serving others,<br/>
And love still shines, tho' days be dark and grim.<br/>
<br/>
O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master,<br/>
The Bible read, the precious hymns still sung;<br/>
Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster,<br/>
And praise is natural speech to ev'ry tongue;<br/>
Where mountains move before a faith that's vaster,<br/>
And Christ sufficient is for old and young.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever!<br/>
We trust to Thee their problems, toil, and care;<br/>
Their bonds of love no enemy can sever<br/>
If Thou art always Lord and Master there:<br/>

Joy to see You lying in Your manger bed,<br/>
Weep to see You dying in our sinful stead.<br/>

Prince of Glory, gracing Heav'n ere time began,<br/>

By Your birth so lowly, by Your love so true,<br/>
By Your cross most holy, Lord, we worship You!<br/>

Bethlehem's Incarnation, Calvary's bitter cross,<br/>
Wrought for us salvation by Your pain and loss;<br/>

With profoundest wonder we Your body take--<br/>
Laid in manger yonder, broken for our sake:<br/>
Hushed in adoration we approach the cup--<br/>
Bethlehem's pure oblation freely offered up.<br/>

Do Your own good pleasure in the lives we bring;<br/>
In Your ransomed treasure reign forever King!<br/>

To the cold winds that chilled my very soul<br/>
& I've sung everything from lonely nights in taverns<br/>
To dime store women on the troll<br/>
& I've sung everything from sunshine to sadness<br/>
From the good life to the hells of Bob McVee<br/>
Now I sing a different song & tell a different story<br/>
'Cause Jesus sang a different song to me<br/>

CHORUS:<br/>
& he said he'd meet me_______________<br/>
(Meet me in the mornin')<br/>
In the mornin'<br/>
(Meet me in the mornin')<br/>
In the sweet still shadows of his love (of his love)<br/>
He said he'd meet me_______________<br/>
(Meet me in the mornin')<br/>
In the mornin'<br/>
(Meet me in the mornin')<br/>
In the warm soft goodness of his love<br/>

<br/>
I've read it in the pages of Matthew, Mark & Proverbs<br/>
Daniel, Revelation, Timothy<br/>
& the wisdom I discovered from cover to cover<br/>
Was enough to scare the Devil out of me<br/>
The words all have reason<br/>
& they're never out of season<br/>
They're the sweetest written words you'll ever hear<br/>
Since I've been readin' Jesus<br/>
I read a different story<br/>
'Cause Jesus, he's been readin' me for years<br/>

In the warm soft goodness of his love<br/>
Of his love___, of his love<br/>

A fervent prayer rose up to heaven,<br/>
A fragile soul was losing ground<br/>
Sorting through this earthly babble,<br/>
Heaven heard the sound.<br/>
It was a life of no distinction,<br/>
No successes, only tries.<br/>
Yet, gazing down on this unlovely one,<br/>
There was love in Heaven's Eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The orphaned child, the wayward father,<br/>
The homeless traveler in the rain<br/>
When life goes by and no one bothers,<br/>
Heaven feels the pain.<br/>
Looking down, God sees each heartache,<br/>
Knows each sorrow, hears each cry,<br/>
And looking up, we'll see compassion's<br/>
Fire ablaze in Heaven's Eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
In Heaven's Eyes, there are no losers,<br/>
In Heaven's Eyes, no hopeless cause.<br/>

And we're amazed at the grace we can find<br/>
In Heaven's Eyes. <br/>

A Few more days on earth to spend.<br/>
And all my toils and cares shall end,<br/>
And I shall see my God and Friend,<br/>
And praise His name on high;<br/>
No more to sigh or shed a tear,<br/>
No more to suffer pain or fear,<br/>
But God, and Christ, and heav'n appear<br/>
Unto the raptured eye.<br/>
<br/>
Then, O my soul, despond no more,<br/>
The storm of life will soon be o'er.<br/>
And I shall find the peaceful shore,<br/>
Of everlasting rest,<br/>
O happy day, O joyful hour!<br/>
When freed from earth my soul shall tow'r<br/>
Beyond the reach of Satan's pow'r.<br/>
To be forever blest.<br/>
<br/>
My soul anticipates the day;<br/>
I'll joyfully the call obey<br/>
Which comes to summon me away<br/>
To seats prepared above;<br/>

And dwell in his beloved embrace,<br/>
And taste the fullness of his grace,<br/>
And sing redeeming love.<br/>

A few more years shall roll,<br/>
A few more seasons come,<br/>
And we shall be with those that rest<br/>
Asleep within the tomb;<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that great day.<br/>
O wash me in Thy precious blood,<br/>
And take my sins away.<br/>
<br/>
A few more suns shall set<br/>
O'er these dark hills of time,<br/>
And we shall be where suns are not<br/>
A far serener clime:<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that blest day.<br/>
O wash me in Thy precious blood,<br/>
And take my sins away.<br/>
<br/>
A few more storms shall beat<br/>
On this wild rocky shore,<br/>
And we shall be where tempests cease,<br/>
And surges swell no more;<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that calm day.<br/>
O wash me in Thy precious blood,<br/>
And take my sins away.<br/>
<br/>
A few more struggles here,<br/>
A few more partings o'er,<br/>
A few more toils, a few more tears,<br/>
And we shall weep no more:<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that bright day.<br/>
O wash me in Thy precious blood,<br/>
And take my sins away.<br/>
<br/>
'Tis but a little while,<br/>
And He shall come again<br/>
Who died that we might live, Who lives<br/>
That we with Him may reign;<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that glad day.<br/>
O wash me in Thy precious blood,<br/>
And take my sins away.<br/>

A foolish king for his 
own praise, <br/>
An image made of gold, <br/>
Then bade all to bow down their heads, <br/>
but three alone stood bold. <br/>
<br/>
And so the king in might rage-- <br/>
He cast them in the flame. <br/>
Yet God saved them from scorching fire, <br/>
And death the overcame. <br/>
<br/>
O Father, those men like your Son, <br/>
Would not to Satan bend. <br/>
If we for Your sake risk our lives, <br/>
Will our lives you defend? <br/>
<br/>
My soul is set at rest because <br/>
Your Word has promised those, <br/>
Who through The Son come unto you <br/>
Shall conquer all their foes. <br/>

A great and mighty wonder,<br/>
a full and holy cure!<br/>
The Virgin bears the Infant<br/>
with virgin-honor pure:<br/>
(R) Repeat the hymn again!<br/>
"To God on high be glory,<br/>
and peace on earth to men."<br/>
<br/>
The Word becomes incarnate,<br/>
and yet remains on high;<br/>
and cherubim sing anthems<br/>
to shepherds from the sky; (R)<br/>
<br/>
While thus they sing your Monarch,<br/>
those bright angelic bands,<br/>
rejoice, ye vales and mountains,<br/>
ye oceans, clap your hands: (R)<br/>

Since all he comes to ransom,<br/>
by all be he adored,<br/>
the infant born in Bethlehem,<br/>
the Savior and the Lord: (R)<br/>

A Home in heav'n! what a joyful thought!<br/>
As the poor man toils in his weary lot;<br/>
His heart oppressed, and with anguish riv'n,<br/>
From his home below to a home in heav'n.<br/>
<br/>
A home in heav'n! as the suff'rer lies<br/>
On his bed of pain, and uplifts his eyes<br/>
To that bright home what a joy is giv'n.<br/>
With the blessed thought of a home in heav'n.<br/>
<br/>
A home in heav'n! when our pleasures fade,<br/>
And our wealth and fame in the dust are laid,<br/>
And our strength decays, and our health is riv'n,<br/>
We are happy still with our home in heav'n.<br/>
<br/>
A home in heav'n! when the sinner mourns,<br/>
And with contrite heart to the Saviour turns;<br/>
O then what bliss in that heart forgiv'n,<br/>
Does the hope inspire of a home in heav'n!<br/>
<br/>
A home in heav'n! when our friends are fled<br/>
To the cheerless home of the mould'ring dead;<br/>
We wait in hope of the promise giv'n,<br/>
We will meet again in our home in heav'n.<br/>

In the twinkling of an 
eye <br/>
My Lord will come for you and I <br/>
We know not when that day will be <br/>
When Jesus comes and sets us free <br/>
<br/>
Be prepared each minute and day <br/>
Look for the sign he's on his way <br/>
Rejoice and praise his Holy name <br/>
Don't seek riches nor not fame <br/>
<br/>
He will come upon a horse white <br/>
For all to see by day or night <br/>
The rapture finally is close at hand <br/>
Stand your guard my mortal man <br/>
<br/>
In the twinkling of an eye <br/>
My Lord will come for you and I <br/>
We know not when that day will be <br/>
When Jesus comes and sets us free <br/>

People steal, they cheat and lie<br/>
For wealth and what it will buy...<br/>
<br/>
But they don't know on the Judgment Day<br/>
<br/>
That Gold and silver will melt away<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be in a deep dark grave<br/>
<br/>
And know that my poor soul was saved...<br/>
<br/>
Than to live in this world in a House of Gold<br/>
<br/>
And deny my God and doom my soul<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What good is Gold and silver, too<br/>
<br/>
If your heart's not good and true<br/>
<br/>
Sinner hear me when I say<br/>

Fall down on your knees and pray <br/>

You are a present joy, O Lord;<br/>

O God, inspire our morning hymn<br/>
Of love and gratitude;<br/>
Oh, bless the sacrifice we bring,<br/>
Thou Source of every good. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Touched by Thy hand of love, we wake,<br/>
And rise from sweet repose;<br/>
Thy praise shall first the silence break,<br/>
Thy peace within us flows. <br/>
<br/>
Thy miracle of love so sweet<br/>
Preserved us all secure;<br/>
While helpless in unconscious sleep,<br/>
Thy presence kept us pure. <br/>
<br/>
’Tis blest to rise, O Lord, and join<br/>
With nature’s minstrelsy;<br/>
To hymn Thy praise at early morn,<br/>
And offer thanks to Thee. <br/>
<br/>
Sweet morning is the time to pray;<br/>
How lovely and how meet,<br/>
To send our early thoughts away<br/>
Up to the mercy seat. <br/>
<br/>
The glorious sun has driven far<br/>
The mystic shades of night;<br/>
So in our souls the morning star<br/>
Hath shed His wondrous light. <br/>

https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/a_lamb_goes_uncomplaining_forth.php




1. A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth,<br/>
The guilt of all men bearing;<br/>
And laden with the sins of earth,<br/>
None else the burden sharing!<br/>
Goes patient on, grow weak and faint,<br/>
To slaughter led without complaint,<br/>
That spotless life to offer;<br/>
Bears shame and stripes, and wounds and death,<br/>
Anguish and mockery, and saith,<br/>
"Willing all this I suffer." <br/>
<br/>
2. This Lamb is Christ, the soul's great Friend,<br/>
The Lamb of God, our Savior;<br/>
Him God the Father chose to send<br/>
To gain for us His favor.<br/>
"Go forth, My Son," the Father saith,<br/>
"And free men from the fear of death,<br/>
From guilt and condemnation.<br/>
The wrath and stripes are hard to bear,<br/>
But by Thy Passion men shall share<br/>
The fruit of Thy salvation." <br/>
<br/>
3. "Yea, Father, yea, most willingly<br/>
I'll bear what Thou commandest;<br/>
My will conforms to Thy decree,<br/>
I do what Thou demandest."<br/>
O wondrous Love, what hast Thou done!<br/>
The Father offers up His Son!<br/>
The Son, content, descendeth!<br/>
O Love, how strong Thou art to save!<br/>
Thou beddest Him within the grave<br/>
Whose word the mountains rendeth. <br/>
<br/>
4. From morn till eve my theme shall be<br/>
Thy mercy's wondrous measure;<br/>
To sacrifice myself for Thee<br/>
Shall be my aim and pleasure.<br/>
My stream of life shall ever be<br/>
A current flowing ceaselessly,<br/>
Thy constant praise outpouring.<br/>
I'll treasure in my memory,<br/>
O Lord, all Thou hast done for me,<br/>
Thy gracious love adoring. <br/>
<br/>
5. Of death I am no more afraid,<br/>
New life from Thee is flowing;<br/>
Thy cross affords me cooling shade<br/>
When noonday's sun is glowing.<br/>
When by my grief I am opprest,<br/>
On Thee my weary soul shall rest<br/>
Serenely as on pillows.<br/>
Thou art my Anchor when by woe<br/>
My bark is driven to and fro<br/>
On trouble's surging billows. <br/>
<br/>
6. And when Thy glory I shall see<br/>
And taste Thy kingdom's pleasure,<br/>
Thy blood my royal robe shall be,<br/>
My joy beyond all measure.<br/>
When I appear before Thy throne,<br/>
Thy righteousness shall be my crown,-<br/>
With these I need not hide me.<br/>
And there, in garments richly wrought<br/>
As Thine own bride, I shall be brought<br/>
To stand in joy beside Thee.<br/>

Just before His trial, Jesus entered dark Gethsemane;<br/>
Leaving eight outside, took Peter and two sons of Zebedee.<br/>
Oh, the anguish in the garden, as again He left the three;<br/>
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary! <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Let us go a little farther, farther than we’ve gone before;<br/>
Are we workers now for Jesus? Let us do a little more. <br/>
<br/>
See Him praying, hear him groaning; death sweeps o’er Him like a flood;<br/>
“Let this cup pass from me, Father"—sweat runs down as drops of blood!<br/>
“Not my will, Lord, I will drink it: let Thy will be done in me."<br/>
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary! <br/>
<br/>
Then at Pilate’s hall, behold Him, as the mob who mocked him cried,<br/>
“Away, away, give us Barabbas; let this Christ be crucified!"<br/>
Oh, Barabbas, oh, Barabbas, Jesus surely died for thee,<br/>
When He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary! <br/>
<br/>
Now He marches to Golgotha, scourged and thorn-crowned on the road;<br/>
Bears the cross upon His shoulder, sinks beneath the heavy load!<br/>
Mocked, reviled, by friends forsaken—all for you, and all for me—<br/>
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary!<br/>
<br/>

O a little talk with Jesus make it right, all right<br/>
Little talk with Jesus make it right, all right<br/>
Troubles of ev’ry kind<br/>
Hank God I’ll always find<br/>
That little talk with Jesus make it right.<br/>
<br/>
My brother, I remember when I was a sinner lost<br/>
I cried, “Have mercy, Jesus"<br/>
But still my soul was tossed<br/>
Till I heard King Jesus say,<br/>
“Come here, I’m on the way"<br/>
And little talk with Jesus make it right.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the fork lightning and muttering thunder, too<br/>
Of trials and temptations<br/>
Make it hard for me and you<br/>
But Jesus was a friend,<br/>
He’ll keep us to the end<br/>
And little talk with Jesus make it right.<br/>
<br/>
My brother and my sister, you have trials like me<br/>
When we are trying to serve the Lord<br/>
And win the victory<br/>
Old Satan fight us hard<br/>
Our journey to retard<br/>
But little talk with Jesus make it right.<br/>

In this world I walk alone<br/>
With no place to call my home<br/>
But there's one who holds my hand<br/>
The rugged road through barren lands<br/>
The way is dark the road is steep<br/>
But He's become my eyes to see<br/>
The strength to climb my grief's to bear<br/>
The Savior lives inside me there<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Your love I find release<br/>
A haven from my unbelief<br/>
Take my life and let me be<br/>
A living prayer my God to Thee<br/>
<br/>
(Take my life and let me be <br/>
a living prayer my God to Thee)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In these trials of life I find<br/>
Another voice inside my mind<br/>
He comforts me and bids me live<br/>
Inside the love the Father gives<br/>
<br/>

I love the Christ, the Son of God,<br/>
Who died that I might live;<br/>
I would my gratitude express,<br/>
A gift unto Him give. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
My gift is small, it is my all,<br/>
Accept it, Lord, I pray;<br/>
Let self be slain, let Jesus reign<br/>
Within my heart alway. <br/>
<br/>
I fail to find a sacrifice,<br/>
Or fitting gift to bring;<br/>
Earth’s treasures have too little worth<br/>
To offer to my King. <br/>
<br/>
No gift, however grand or great,<br/>
Could pay the debt I owe;<br/>
I bring myself, my life, my all,<br/>
A living gift bestow. <br/>
<br/>
My members all I gladly yield<br/>
For service, Lord, to Thee;<br/>
To bear the blessed gospel light,<br/>
That others Christ may see. <br/>

A long time ago, there was a man<br/>
Who laid his life on the line<br/>
He claimed he could make the lame walk again<br/>
And give back the sight to the blind<br/>
Now some people loved him<br/>
Some people wanted to take him and put him away<br/>
Well I wasn't there to see what he did<br/>
But if he was right here today...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
I would crawl all the way to the river<br/>
I would crawl all the way to the sea<br/>
Just to watch him walk on the water<br/>
And lay his loving hands on me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A carpenter by trade, but the kingdom that he made<br/>
Was built without hammer and nail<br/>
It stands like a rock though the ages of time<br/>
It was built with a love that never fails<br/>
I read in the good book that some day he's coming<br/>
And some say it ain't far away<br/>
On the day that he stands on the banks of the Jordan<br/>
I know I will be on my way<br/>

The ransomed who shine in its beauty,<br/>
Will dwell in that city so fair. <br/>

Refrain:<br/>
Oh, home above,<br/>
I’m going to dwell in that home;<br/>
Oh, home of love,<br/>
Get ready, poor sinner, and come. <br/>
<br/>
A mansion of rest for the weary,<br/>
Who toil in the vineyard of love;<br/>
O sinner, believe, and be ready<br/>
To enter that mansion above. <br/>
<br/>
A mansion where heavenly music<br/>
Enraptures the glorified throng;<br/>
They’re singing salvation, O sinner,<br/>
Come, join in that beautiful song. <br/>
<br/>
A mansion where angels are waiting<br/>
To welcome the holy and true,<br/>
And when to the Savior low kneeling,<br/>
They’ll sing a sweet anthem for you. <br/>

A mansion unclouded by sorrow,<br/>
Undimmed by the pains of farewell,<br/>
Where all of earth’s pilgrims will gather,<br/>
With Christ in His glory to dwell. <br/>

A mighty fortress is our God, <br/>
a bulwark never failing;<br/>
Our helper he, amid the flood<br/>
of mortal ills prevailing:<br/>
For still our ancient foe <br/>
doth seek to work us woe;<br/>
His craft and power are great, <br/>
and, armed with cruel hate,<br/>
On earth is not his equal.<br/>
<br/>
Did we in our strength confide, <br/>
our striving would be losing;<br/>
Were not the right Man on our side, <br/>
the Man of God's own choosing:<br/>
Dost ask who that may be? <br/>
Christ Jesus, it is He;<br/>
Lord Sabbaoth, His Name, <br/>
from age to age the same,<br/>
And He must win the battle.<br/>
<br/>
And though this world, with devils filled, <br/>
should threaten to undo us,<br/>
We will not fear, for God hath willed <br/>
his truth to triumph through us:<br/>
the Prince of Darkness grim, <br/>
we tremble not for him;<br/>
His rage we can endure, <br/>
for lo, his doom is sure,<br/>
one little word shall fell him.<br/>
<br/>
That word above all earthly powers, <br/>
no thanks to them, abideth;<br/>
The Spirit and the gifts are ours <br/>
through Him Who with us sideth:<br/>
Let good and kindred go, <br/>
this mortal life also;<br/>
the body they may kill: <br/>
God's truth abideth still,<br/>
his kingdom is forever.https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/all_my_life_long_i_had_panted.php



All my life long I had panted<br/>
For a draught from some cool spring,<br/>
That I hoped would quench the burning<br/>
Of the thirst I felt within. <br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah! I have found Him<br/>
Whom my soul so long has craved!<br/>
Jesus satisfies my longings;<br/>
Through His life I now am saved. <br/>
<br/>
Feeding on the husks around me,<br/>
Till my strength was almost gone,<br/>
Longed my soul for something better,<br/>
Only still to hunger on. <br/>
<br/>
Poor I was, and sought for riches,<br/>
Something that would satisfy,<br/>
But the dust I gathered round me<br/>
Only mocked my soul's sad cry. <br/>
<br/>
Well of water, ever springing,<br/>
Bread of life, so rich and free,<br/>
Untold wealth that never faileth,<br/>
My Redeemer is to me. <br/>

A wondrous sign and seal;<br/>
Lord, give our hearts to know its worth,<br/>
And all its truth to feel.<br/>
<br/>
Death to the world we thus avow,<br/>
Death to each sinful lust;<br/>
The risen life is our life now,<br/>
The risen Christ our trust.<br/>

Baptised into the Father's name,<br/>
We're children of our God;<br/>
Baptised into the Son, we claim<br/>
The ransom of his blood.<br/>

Verse 1:
<br/>
There is going to be a brand new morning. <br/>
There is going to be a brand new day. <br/>
Rest assured that day is coming <br/>
when Jesus comes to take me away. <br/>
The angels are rejoicing in heaven <br/>
They have waited so long for me. <br/>
I'm been working to get my life in order <br/>
Now I'm ready for the jubilee. <br/>
<br/>
Verse 2: <br/>
When they open the gates in heaven <br/>
He will descend on a beautiful cloud. <br/>
His arms will be open to me <br/>
As the trumpets sound out loud. <br/>
The thorns that once adorned his brow for all the world to see. <br/>
Will be a golden crown for him to wear for all eternity. <br/>

1. A Pilgrim and a Stranger,<br/>
I journey here below;<br/>
Far distant is my country,<br/>
The home to which I go.<br/>
Here I must toil and travail,<br/>
Oft weary and opprest;<br/>
But there my God shall lead me<br/>
To everlasting rest. <br/>
<br/>
2. I've met with storms and danger<br/>
E'en from my early years,<br/>
With enemies and conflicts,<br/>
With fightings and with fears.<br/>
There's nothing here that tempts me<br/>
To wish a longer stay,<br/>
So I must hasten forward,<br/>
No halting or delay. <br/>
<br/>
3. It is a well-worn pathway;<br/>
A host has gone before,<br/>
The holy saints and prophets,<br/>
The patriarchs of yore.<br/>
They trod the toilsome journey<br/>
In patience and in faith;<br/>
And them I fain would follow,<br/>
Like them in life and death. <br/>
<br/>
4. Who would share Abraham's blessing<br/>
Must Abraham's path pursue,<br/>
A stranger and a pilgrim,<br/>
Like him, must journey through.<br/>
The foes must be encountered,<br/>
The dangers must be passed;<br/>
A faithful soldier only<br/>
Receives the crown at last. <br/>
<br/>
5. So I must hasten forward,-<br/>
Thank God, the end will come!<br/>
This land of passing shadows<br/>
Is not my destined home.<br/>
The everlasting city,<br/>
Jerusalem above,<br/>
This evermore abideth,<br/>
The home of light and love. <br/>
<br/>
6. There still my thoughts are dwelling,<br/>
'Tis there I long to be;<br/>
Come, Lord, and call Thy servant<br/>
To blessedness with Thee.<br/>
Come, bid my toils be ended,<br/>
Let all my wanderings cease;<br/>
Call from the wayside lodging<br/>
To Thy sweet home of peace. <br/>
<br/>
7. There I shall dwell forever,<br/>
No more a parting guest,<br/>
With all thy blood-bought children<br/>
In everlasting rest,<br/>
The pilgrim toils forgotten,<br/>
The pilgrim conflicts o'er,<br/>
All earthly griefs behind me,<br/>
Eternal joys before.<br/>
<br/>

Savior, Thou art life to me,<br/>
Guard me by Thy watchful eye;<br/>
Ever by Thy Spirit be<br/>
Thou a guide to worlds on high.<br/>
Hide me from the storms of life;<br/>
Keep me from the tempter’s snare;<br/>
And while here ’mid toil and strife,<br/>
Let me cast on Thee my care. <br/>
<br/>
Help me, Lord, to faithful be,<br/>
Give me grace to do Thy will;<br/>
That through all eternity,<br/>
Holy love my soul may thrill.<br/>
For though blest by worldly store,<br/>
Sanctioned by the creeds of men;<br/>
Jesus says, “I am the door,"—<br/>
He alone can save from sin. <br/>
<br/>
Teach me from Thy blessed Word<br/>
Lessons precious to my soul;<br/>
Help me understand it, Lord,<br/>
By it make and keep me whole.<br/>
By Thy Word we stand or fall,<br/>
By Thy Word we live or die;<br/>
If in part and not by all,<br/>
Then we make His word a lie. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, Thou art my refuge here,<br/>
All my hopes are built on Thee;<br/>
From all sin and slavish fear<br/>
Jesus makes me fully free.<br/>
So when all my toils are o’er,<br/>
Let me gain that blest abode;<br/>
And with loved ones gone before,<br/>
Ever dwell with me, my God. <br/>

A prophet-woman broke a jar<br/>
by Love's divine appointing.<br/>
With rare perfume she filled the room,<br/>
presiding and anointing.<br/>
A prophet-woman broke a jar,<br/>
the sneers of scorn defying.<br/>
With rare perfume she filled the room,<br/>
preparing Christ for dying.<br/>
<br/>
A faithful woman left a tomb<br/>
by Love's divine commission.<br/>
She saw, she heard, she preached the word,<br/>
arising from submission.<br/>
A faithful woman left a tomb<br/>
with resurrection gospel.<br/>
She saw, she heard, she preached the word,<br/>
apostle to apostles.<br/>
<br/>
Though woman-wisdom, woman-truth<br/>
for centuries were hidden,<br/>
unsung, unwritten, and unheard,<br/>
derided and forbidden,<br/>
the Spirit's breath, the Spirit's fire,<br/>
on free and slave, descending,<br/>
can tumble our diving walls,<br/>
our shame and sadness mending.<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit knows, the Spirit calls,<br/>
by Love's divine ordaining,<br/>
the friends we need, to serve and lead,<br/>
their powers and gifts unchaining.<br/>
The Spirit knows, the Spirit calls<br/>
from women, men, and children<br/>
the friends we need, to serve and lead.<br/>
Rejoice and make them welcome!<br/>

A purple robe, a crown of thorn,<br/>
A reed in His right hand;<br/>
Before the soldiers’ spite and scorn<br/>
I see my Savior stand.<br/>
He bears between the Roman guard<br/>
The weight of all our woe;<br/>
A stumbling figure, bowed and scarred,<br/>
I see my Savior go.<br/>
<br/>
He hangs, by whom the world was made,<br/>
Beneath the darkened sky;<br/>
The everlasting ransom paid,<br/>
I see my Savior die.<br/>
He shares on high His Father’s throne,<br/>
Who once in mercy came;<br/>
For all His love to sinners shown<br/>
I sing my Savior’s Name.<br/>

Written by Johann S. Munth<br/>
<br/>
A rest remaineth for the weary;<br/>
Arise, sad heart, and grieve no more;<br/>
Though long the way, and dark and dreary,<br/>
It endeth on the golden shore.<br/>
Before His throne the Lamb will lead thee,<br/>
On heav’nly pastures He will feed thee,<br/>
Cast off thy burden, come with haste;<br/>
Soon will the toil and strife be ended,<br/>
The weary way which thou hast wended.<br/>
Sweet is the rest which thou shalt taste.<br/>
<br/>
The Father’s house has many a dwelling,<br/>
And there will be a place for thee.<br/>
With perfect love His heart is welling<br/>
Who loved thee from eternity.<br/>
His precious blood the Lamb hath given<br/>
That thou might’st share the joys of Heaven,<br/>
And now He calleth far and near:<br/>
“Ye weary souls, cease your repining,<br/>
Come while for you My light is shining;<br/>
Come, sweetest rest awaits you here!" <br/>
<br/>
O come, come all, ye weak and weary,<br/>
Ye souls bowed down with many a care;<br/>
Arise and leave your dungeons dreary<br/>
And listen to His promise fair:<br/>
“Ye bore your burdens meek and lowly,<br/>
I will fulfill My pledge most holy,<br/>
I’ll be your solace and your rest.<br/>
Ye are Mine own, I will requite you;<br/>
Though sin and Satan seek to smite you,<br/>
Rejoice! Your home is with the blest."<br/>
<br/>
There rest and peace in endless measure<br/>
Shall be ours through eternity;<br/>
No grief, no care, shall mar our pleasure,<br/>
And untold bliss our lot shall be.<br/>
Oh, had we wings to hasten yonder—<br/>
No more o’er earthly ills to ponder—<br/>
To join the glad, triumphant band!<br/>
Make haste, my soul, forget all sadness;<br/>
For peace awaits thee, joy and gladness—<br/>
The perfect rest is nigh at hand.<br/>

A safe stronghold our God is still,<br/>
a trusty shield and weapon;<br/>
he'll keep us clear from all the ill<br/>
that hath us now o'ertaken.<br/>
The ancient prince of hell<br/>
hath risen with purpose fell;<br/>
strong mail of craft and power<br/>
he weareth in this hour;<br/>
on earth is not his fellow.<br/>
<br/>
With force of arms we nothing can,<br/>
full soon were we down-ridden;<br/>
but for us fights the proper Man,<br/>
whom God himself hath bidden.<br/>
Ask ye, who is this same?<br/>
Christ Jesus is his name,<br/>
the Lord Sabaoth's Son;<br/>
he, and no other one,<br/>
shall conquer in the battle.<br/>
<br/>
And were this world all devils o'er,<br/>
and watching to devour us,<br/>
we lay it not to heart so sore;<br/>
nor they can overpower us.<br/>
And let the prince of ill<br/>
look grim as e'er he will,<br/>
he harms us not a whit;<br/>
for why?--his doom is writ;<br/>
a word shall quickly slay him.<br/>
<br/>
God's word, for all their craft and force,<br/>
one moment will not linger,<br/>
but, spite of hell, shall have its course;<br/>
'tis written by his finger.<br/>
And though they take our life,<br/>
goods, honor, children, wife,<br/>
yet is their profit small;<br/>
these things shall vanish all:<br/>
the City of God remaineth!<br/>

A servant’s heart is what I need<br/>
To follow and obey<br/>
My pleasure is to live for You<br/>
To do just as You say<br/>
<br/>
On the altar is my life<br/>
A sacrifice for You<br/>
I live and breathe each moment Lord<br/>
A willing slave for You<br/>
<br/>
But Lord You know I stumble hard<br/>
I hear the voices all around<br/>
That mock and cause my heart to fear<br/>
Although You’re always near<br/>
<br/>
A servant I will choose to be<br/>
Yet when I’m weak Lord strengthen me<br/>
My eyes will never look behind<br/>
I’ll cling to You for You are mine<br/>
My Master O, my Master<br/>
I’m a sacrifice for You<br/>

I can feel You here<br/>
So deep down in my heart<br/>

But who am I?<br/>
A simple servant, I know I am!<br/>
Touching the garment of a King<br/>

If angels praise You all day long<br/>
By Your shining throne in heaven<br/>

There’s a song in my heart that my lips cannot sing,<br/>

A sinner made whole! A sinner made whole!<br/>
The Savior has bought me and ransomed my soul!<br/>
My heart now is singing; there’s joy in my soul,<br/>
For I was a sinner, but Christ made me whole.<br/>
<br/>
I shall stand one day faultless and pure by His throne,<br/>
Transformed from my image, conformed to His own;<br/>
Then I shall find words for the song of my soul,<br/>
For I was a sinner, but Christ made me whole.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>

All the music of Heaven, so perfect and sweet,<br/>

I was a slave to sin <br/>
I did not even know <br/>
Not only did He reveal the truth <br/>
But He made me his child<br/>
<br/>
(Chorus)<br/>
I am unlovable<br/>
I am as dirty rags<br/>
But when He looked at me<br/>
His arms were filled with love<br/>
<br/>
He gave me new life<br/>
I am so thankful<br/>
The only thing I can give to Him<br/>
Is to serve Him all my life<br/>

A slave and captive now 
was I, <br/>
For I am dead in sin. <br/>
My life’s a waste; I’m now alone, <br/>
Without a friend or kin. <br/>
<br/>
What is this earth and sea so vast? <br/>
What secret Will hath made? <br/>
Whence now, poor wretch, have I come from? <br/>
God made me, without aid. <br/>

His mighty pow’r hath made all things; <br/>
With wisdom God abides. <br/>
Of his delights I fully know, <br/>
God governs and he guides. <br/>

Who is this that cometh from the wilderness,<br/>
Leaning on her well-beloved’s arm,<br/>
Sweeter than the fragrant rose of Sharon,<br/>
Winning all our hearts by her charm? <br/>

Refrain:<br/>
Blessed bride of Christ, we now adore thee;<br/>
Treasure of our hearts, we hymn thy praise;<br/>
Church of God, we love thee and no other;<br/>

Clearer than the moon’s celestial light,<br/>
Brighter than the sun’s effulgent glory,<br/>
Banishing the darkness of night? <br/>
<br/>
Who is she that standeth on the mountain,<br/>
Singing to our hearts a song of joy,<br/>
Fairer than the lilies of the valley,<br/>
Pure as gold refined from alloy? <br/>

Who is she, the fairest of ten thousand,<br/>
Shining with the brightness of the sun,<br/>
Queen of love, and choice one of her mother?<br/>
She, my undefiled, is but one. <br/>

It seems like angel voices,<br/>
In strains of joy and love,<br/>
That swell the mighty chorus<br/>
Around the throne above.<br/>

Refrain<br/>
O sweet, celestial music,<br/>
Heard from a land afar—<br/>
The song of Heav’n and Homeland,<br/>
Thro’ doors God leaves ajar!<br/>
<br/>
Now soft, and low, and restful,<br/>
It floods my soul with peace,<br/>
As if God’s benediction<br/>
Bade all earth’s troubles cease.<br/>
Then, grander than the voices<br/>
Of wind, and wave, and sea—<br/>
It fills the dome of Heaven<br/>
With glorious harmony.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
This music haunts me ever,<br/>
Like something heard in dreams—<br/>
It seems to catch the cadence<br/>
Of heav’nly winds and streams.<br/>

To think, some day to come,<br/>
I’ll sing it with the angels—<br/>
The song of Heav’n and home.<br/>

A song was heard at Christmas<br/>
to wake the midnight sky:<br/>
a Savior's birth, and peace on earth,<br/>
and praise to God on high.<br/>
The angels sang at Christmas<br/>
with all the hosts above,<br/>
and still we sing the newborn King,<br/>
his glory and his love.<br/>
<br/>
A star was seen at Christmas,<br/>
a herald and a sign,<br/>
that men might know the way to go<br/>
to find the child divine.<br/>
The wise men watched at Christmas<br/>
in some far eastern land,<br/>
and still the wise in starry skies<br/>
discern their Maker's hand.<br/>
<br/>
A tree was grown at Christmas,<br/>
a sapling green and young:<br/>
no tinsel bright with candlelight<br/>
upon its branches hung.<br/>
But he who came at Christmas<br/>
our sins and sorrows bore,<br/>
and still we name his tree of shame<br/>
our life for evermore.<br/>
<br/>
A child was born at Christmas<br/>
when Christmas first began:<br/>
the Lord of all a baby small,<br/>
for love of men made man.<br/>
For love is ours at Christmas,<br/>
and life and light restored,<br/>
and so we praise through endless days<br/>
the Savior, Christ the Lord.<br/>

I'm sure he must have been surprised at where this road had taken him<br/>
'Cause never in a million lives would he have dreamed of Bethlehem<br/>
And standing at the manger He saw with his own eyes<br/>
The message from the angel come to life and Joseph said·<br/>
<br/>
Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade<br/>
Why Him, with all the rulers in the world<br/>
Why here, inside this stable filled with hay<br/>
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl<br/>
Now I'm not one to second guess what angels have to say<br/>
But this is such a strange way to save the world<br/>
<br/>
To think of how it could have been, if Jesus had come as He deserved<br/>
There would have been no Bethlehem No lowly shepherds at His birth<br/>
But Joseph knew the reason Love had to reach so far<br/>
And as he held the Savior in his arms, he must have thought· <br/>

A stranger once did bless the earth<br/>
who never caused a heart to mourn,<br/>
whose very voice gave sorrow mirth;<br/>
and how did earth his worth return?<br/>
it spurned him from its lowliest lot:<br/>
the meanest station owned him not.<br/>
<br/>
An outcast thrown in sorrow's way,<br/>
a fugitive that knew no sin,<br/>
yet in lone places forced to stray;<br/>
men would not take the stranger in.<br/>
Yet peace, though much himself he mourned,<br/>
was all to others he returned.<br/>
<br/>
His presence was a peace to all,<br/>
he bade the sorrowful rejoice.<br/>
Pain turned to pleasure at his call,<br/>
health lived and issued from his voice;<br/>
he healed the sick, and sent abroad<br/>
the dumb rejoicing in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The blind met daylight in his eye,<br/>
the joys of everlasting day;<br/>
the sick found health in his reply,<br/>
the cripple threw his crutch away.<br/>
Yet he with troubles did remain,<br/>
and suffered poverty and pain.<br/>
<br/>
It was for sin he suffered all<br/>
to set the world-imprisoned free,<br/>
to cheer the weary when they call;<br/>
and who could such a stranger be?<br/>
The God, who hears each human cry,<br/>
and came, a Saviour, from on high.<br/>

When we pass the golden summer,<br/>
And, like autumn leaves, retire<br/>
On the bosom of our mother,<br/>
Will our song of praise expire?<br/>
 <br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Oh, we’ll sing a sweeter anthem,<br/>
With unnumbered millions there;<br/>
Glory, honor, and salvation,<br/>
In our home so bright and fair. <br/>
<br/>
If our soul is blest in singing<br/>
In this feeble house of clay,<br/>
Who can tell the bliss of reigning<br/>
In our home of endless day? <br/>
<br/>
Is it sweet to hymn the story,<br/>
Of salvation here below?<br/>
Oh, what anthems filled with glory<br/>
From the throne of God shall flow! <br/>
<br/>
Do we love our dear Redeemer,<br/>
And rejoice that we are His?<br/>
We will love and praise Him better<br/>
When we see Him as He is. <br/>
<br/>
Glory, glory be to Jesus!<br/>
Let us shout with joyful praise<br/>
To the Rock of our salvation<br/>
All this life and endless days. <br/>

I’ll tell you a tale of the olden time,<br/>
While the yule log burns bright, and the church bells chime.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
There sate a fair princess in joy on her throne,<br/>
And there in her arms her Infant was shown:<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
The beasts of the meadows bowed down their head<br/>
All under the moonlight so softly shed.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
They worshipped the King of Creation there<br/>
In the arms of the mother so passing fair.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
O who are these masters of ancient mould?<br/>
O these are the shepherds, the lords of the fold;<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
They have heard from the sky of the birth of their King,<br/>
They have heard all the sky with the harmony ring.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
The kings of the east in number three,<br/>
All worship the Monarch of high degree;<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
Their tribute they offer, their heads they bow,<br/>
And clearer and clearer is echoing now,<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
For all the zenith is blazing with light,<br/>
And musical voices enrapture the night:<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
O this is the carol of peace and goodwill<br/>
From the voices celestial, the zenith that fill;<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>

A thousand years have come and gone, and near a thousand more,<br/>
Since happier light from heaven shone than ever shone before:<br/>
And in the hearts of old and young a joy most joyful stirred.<br/>
That sent such news from tongue to tongue as ears had never heard.<br/>
<br/>
Then angels on their starry way felt bliss unfelt before,<br/>
For news that men should be as they to darkened earth they bore;<br/>
So toiling men and spirits bright a first communion had,<br/>
And in meek mercy’s rising light were each exceeding glad.<br/>
<br/>
And we are glad, and we will sing, as in the days of yore;<br/>
Come all, and hearts made ready bring, to welcome back once more<br/>
The day when first on wintry earth a summer change began,<br/>
And, dawning in a lowly birth uprose the Light of man.<br/>
<br/>
For trouble such as men must bear from childhood to fourscore,<br/>
He shared with us, that we might share His joy forevermore;<br/>
And twice a thousand years of grief of conflict, and of sin,<br/>
May tell how large the harvest sheaf His patient love shall win.<br/>

A Virgin most pure, as the prophets do tell,<br/>
Hath brought forth a baby, as it hath befell,<br/>
To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,<br/>
Which Adam's transgression hath wrapped us in:<br/>
<br/>
Aye and therefore be merry,<br/>
rejoice and be you merry,<br/>
Set sorrows aside;<br/>
Christ Jesus our Saviour<br/>
was born on this tide.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At Bethlem in Jewry a city there was,<br/>
Where Joseph and Mary together did pass,<br/>
And there to be taxed with many one mo',<br/>
For Caesar commanded the same should be so:<br/>
<br/>
But when they had entered the city so fair,<br/>
A number of people so mighty was there,<br/>
That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,<br/>
Could find in the inn there no lodging at all:<br/>
<br/>
Then they were constrained in a stable to lie,<br/>
Where horses and asses they used for to tie;<br/>
Their lodging so simple the took it no scorn,<br/>
But against the next morning our Saviour was born:<br/>
<br/>
The King of all kings to this world being brought,<br/>
Small store of fine linen to wrap him was sought;<br/>
And when she had swaddled her young son so sweet,<br/>
Within an ox-manger she laid him to sleep:<br/>
<br/>
Then God sent an angel from heaven so high,<br/>
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,<br/>
And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,<br/>
Because that our Saviour was born on this day:<br/>
<br/>
Then presently after the shepherds did spy<br/>
A number of angels that stood in the sky;<br/>
They joyfully talked, and sweetly did sing,<br/>
To God be all glory, our heavenly King:<br/>

Yes, Jesus loves me<br/>

A wedding took place in the village of Cana,<br/>
And Jesus, His mother, and followers all came.<br/>
The wine was exhausted, and Mary informed Him,<br/>
“They have no more wine"—this would surely bring shame.<br/>
“Dear woman," He answered, “why do you involve Me?<br/>
My time to be recognized has not yet come."<br/>
His mother then said to the servants there waiting,<br/>
“Whatever He tells you, now let it be done."<br/>
<br/>
Six water jars stood there for ritual washing,<br/>
Each holding then full twenty gallons or more.<br/>
He said to the servants, “Now fill them with water."<br/>
They filled them brimful; there was no room for more.<br/>
Then Jesus instructed, “Take some to the master."<br/>
The water had turned into wine—none knew how.<br/>
On tasting, the master exclaimed in amazement,<br/>
“The choicest and best wine you’ve saved until now!"<br/>
<br/>
When Jesus turned water to wine there in Cana,<br/>
This was the first miracle He’d ever done.<br/>
His glory He thus did reveal to the people,<br/>
And as a result, His disciples were won.<br/>
Lord, may I be like them, believing You fully.<br/>
And like the stone water jars, may I e’er be,<br/>
Filled up to the brim with Your transforming Spirit.<br/>
Reveal now Your glory to others through me.<br/>

A wife of noble 
character, <br/>
Is guerdon from the hand of God. <br/>
She works all day with eager hands, <br/>
Invests herself in every job. <br/>
<br/>
She is not proud but full of love <br/>
And helps the hungry and the weak. <br/>
Her husband has full faith in her; <br/>
Of her, her children highly speak. <br/>

She speaks with wisdom, faith, and love, <br/>
And faithfulness receives reward <br/>
The gilt of beauty fades away, <br/>
But praised is she who fears the Lord. <br/>

A small spark, course on fire<br/>
On fire<br/>
A small spark, course on fire<br/>
<br/>
So many animals, birds of the air, and the fish in the sea<br/>
We have been able to bring them all under control<br/>
Out of the mouth we hear praising and cursing, and this shouldn't be<br/>
Funny we're not as successful in guiding our souls<br/>
Though it's small, the tongue has power, more than you know<br/>
Like a rudder pilots where you go<br/>
We submit to restless evil, full knowing well<br/>
It's poisonous and set on fire by hell<br/>

Speaking before we are thinking, so careless with all that we say<br/>
Making remarks when we fail to consider the reason<br/>
We often react without knowin' the facts, and our tongues won't obey<br/>
Bein' corrupted with words that are full of the poison<br/>
Knowing better we should be not be down in the mire<br/>
Course directed by the burning fire<br/>
Since the time we learn to talk, we're never the same<br/>
Full of power that we cannot tame (tame)<br/>

Though it's a spark (a small spark) (a world of evil)<br/>

I was once a sinner, but I came<br/>
Pardon to receive from my Lord:<br/>
This was freely given, and I found<br/>
That He always kept His word.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a new name written down in glory,<br/>
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!<br/>
And the white robed angels sing the story,<br/>
“A sinner has come home."<br/>
For there’s a new name written down in glory,<br/>
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!<br/>
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,<br/>
Never more to roam.<br/>
<br/>
I was humbly kneeling at the cross,<br/>
Fearing naught by God’s angry frown;<br/>
When the heavens opened and I saw<br/>
That my name was written down.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a new name written down in glory,<br/>
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!<br/>
And the white robed angels sing the story,<br/>
“A sinner has come home."<br/>
For there’s a new name written down in glory,<br/>
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!<br/>
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,<br/>
Never more to roam.<br/>
<br/>
In the Book ’tis written, “Saved by Grace,"<br/>
O the joy that came to my soul!<br/>
Now I am forgiven, and I know<br/>
By the blood I am made whole.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a new name written down in glory,<br/>
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!<br/>
And the white robed angels sing the story,<br/>
“A sinner has come home."<br/>
For there’s a new name written down in glory,<br/>
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!<br/>
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,<br/>
Never more to roam.<br/>

I'm feeling like the eagle that rises<br/>
Flies above the earth and it's troubles<br/>
Oh yes it knows that there are valleys below<br/>
But under his wings there's a stronger power<br/>
<br/>
Oh Father-You are my strength<br/>
On you I wait upon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
You make the road rise up to meet me<br/>
You make the sunshine warm upon my face<br/>
The wind is at my back & the rain falls soft<br/>
God I lift you high-You are my Abba<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Running in this race to the finish line<br/>
The only road for me is the narrow<br/>
Not gonna stop or even look to the side<br/>
When I fix my eyes upon You Jesus<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh Father (Abba)-You are my strength <br/>
Now more than ever<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS<br/>
REPEAT<br/>
<br/>
When you've run too far-and the road is long<br/>
Can't walk another mile-He is waiting<br/>
Hope in Him again-He'll renew you<br/>
Then you will rise, gather up your wings and fly...<br/>

“Abba, Father!" We approach Thee<br/>
In our Savior’s precious Name;<br/>
We, Thy children, here assembled,<br/>
Now Thy promised blessing claim;<br/>
From our sins His blood hath washed us,<br/>
’Tis through Him our souls draw nigh,<br/>
And Thy Spirit, too, hath taught us,<br/>
“Abba, Father," thus to cry.<br/>
<br/>
Once as prodigals we wandered<br/>
In our folly far from Thee,<br/>
But Thy grace, o’er sin abounding,<br/>
Rescued us from misery;<br/>
Thou Thy prodigals hast pardoned,<br/>
Kissed us with a Father’s love,<br/>
Spread the festive board, and called us,<br/>
E’er to dwell with Thee above.<br/>
<br/>
Clothed in garments of salvation,<br/>
At Thy table is our place,<br/>
We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest,<br/>
In the riches of Thy grace;<br/>
“It is meet," we hear Thee saying,<br/>
“We should merry and be glad,<br/>
I have found My once lost children,<br/>
Now they live who once were dead."<br/>
<br/>
“Abba, Father!" all adore Thee,<br/>
All rejoice in Heav’n above,<br/>
While in us they learn the wonders<br/>
Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love;<br/>
Soon before Thy throne assembled,<br/>
All Thy children shall proclaim,<br/>
“Glory, everlasting glory,<br/>
Be to God and to the Lamb!"<br/>

O Abba, Father, Lord of 
Life, <br/>
What choice can curb your will? <br/>
Though men may plot their sep’rate course, <br/>
Each step obeys you still. <br/>
<br/>
O Mighty God and Upright Judge, <br/>
Who keeps their death at bay? <br/>
Men whitewash tombs and flee in vain <br/>
Your throne and judgment day. <br/>
<br/>
O Wondrous King of majesty <br/>
Who sees your holy place? <br/>
The west would fold upon the east <br/>
To glimpse your shining face. <br/>
<br/>
O Couns’lor, Christ; Love sacrificed, <br/>
My joy, my goal, my aim, <br/>
What flesh or foil can claim or spoil <br/>
Your holy, righteous name. <br/>
<br/>

Abba O Abba Father<br/>
You are the potter<br/>
And we are the clay,<br/>
The work of your hands<br/>
Mould us mould us and <br/>
Fashion us, <br/>
Into the image,<br/>
Of Jesus your Son<br/>
Of Jesus your Son.<br/>
Father, may we be one in you,<br/>
May we be one in you,<br/>
As he is in you,<br/>
And you are in him<br/>
Glory, glory and praise to thee<br/>
Glory and praise to thee<br/>
Forever amen....<br/>
Forever amen....<br/>
Forever amen....<br/>

Abide in me, O Lord, and I in Thee,<br/>
From this good hour, oh, leave me nevermore;<br/>
Then shall the discord cease, the wound be healed,<br/>
The lifelong bleeding of the soul be o’er.<br/>
<br/>
Abide in me; o’ershadow by Thy love<br/>
Each half formed purpose and dark thought of sin;<br/>
Quench ere it rise each selfish, low desire,<br/>
And keep my soul as Thine, calm and divine.<br/>
<br/>
As some rare perfume in a vase of clay,<br/>
Pervades it with a fragrance not its own,<br/>
So, when Thou dwellest in a mortal soul,<br/>
All Heaven’s own sweetness seems around it thrown.<br/>
<br/>
Abide in me; there have been moments blest<br/>
When I have heard Thy voice and felt Thy power;<br/>
Then evil lost its grasp; and passion, hushed,<br/>
Owned the divine enchantment of the hour.<br/>
<br/>
These were but seasons beautiful and rare;<br/>
Abide in me, and they shall ever be;<br/>
Fulfill at once Thy precept and my prayer,<br/>
Come, and abide in me, and I in Thee.<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/abideinthee.php

Abide in Thee, in that deep love of Thine,<br/>
My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine;<br/>
Down, closely down, as living branch with tree,<br/>
I would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Abide in Thee, my Savior, God, I know<br/>
How love of Thine, so vast, in me may flow:<br/>
My empty vessel running o’er with joy,<br/>
Now overflows to Thee without alloy.<br/>
<br/>
Abide in Thee, nor doubt, nor self, nor sin,<br/>
Can e’er prevail with Thy blest life within;<br/>
Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul<br/>
Knows naught besides its motions to control.<br/>
<br/>
Abide in Thee, ’tis thus alone I know<br/>
The secrets of Thy mind e’en while below;<br/>
All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy Word,<br/>
All power and fruit, and service for the Lord.<br/>
<br/>

Abide not in the realm of dreams,<br/>
O man, however fair it seems;<br/>
But with clear eye the present scan,<br/>
And hear the call of God and man.<br/>
<br/>
Think not in sleep to fold thy hands,<br/>
Forgetful of thy Lord’s commands;<br/>
From duty’s claims no life is free,<br/>
Behold, today hath need of thee.<br/>
<br/>
The present hour allots thy task,<br/>
For present strength and patience ask;<br/>
And trust His love Whose sure supply<br/>
Meets all thy need abundantly.<br/>

Abide, O dearest Jesus,<br/>
Among us with Thy grace,<br/>
That Satan may not harm us,<br/>
Nor we to sin give place.<br/>

Abide, O dear Redeemer,<br/>
Among us with Thy Word,<br/>
And thus now and hereafter<br/>
True peace and joy afford.<br/>
<br/>
Abide with heav’nly brightness<br/>
Among us, precious Light;<br/>
Thy truth direct, and keep us<br/>
From error’s gloomy night.<br/>
<br/>
Abide with richest blessings<br/>
Among us, bounteous Lord;<br/>
Let us in grace and wisdom<br/>
Grow daily through Thy Word.<br/>
<br/>
Abide with Thy protection<br/>
Among us, Lord, our Strength,<br/>
Lest world and Satan fell us<br/>
And overcome at length.<br/>
<br/>
Abide, O faithful Savior,<br/>
Among us with Thy love;<br/>
Grant steadfastness, and help us<br/>
To reach our home above.<br/>

“Abide with us, the day is waning,"<br/>
Thus prayed the two while on the way;<br/>
We read that Thou, O Lord, remaining,<br/>
Didst all their doubts and fears allay.<br/>
Incline Thine ear, Thou King of Grace,<br/>
When, praying thus, we seek Thy face.<br/>
<br/>
At eventide, Thy Spirit sending,<br/>
Help us, O Lord, our watch to keep,<br/>
In prayer devout before Thee bending,<br/>
Ere we our eyelids close in sleep,<br/>
Confessing sin in deed and word<br/>
With hope of mercy from the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Abide with us; with heav’nly gladness<br/>
Illumine, Lord, our darkest day;<br/>
And when we weep in pain and sadness,<br/>
Be Thou our Solace, Strength and Stay.<br/>
Tell of Thy woe, Thy victory won,<br/>
When Thou didst pray: “Thy will be done."<br/>
<br/>
Abide with us, O Savior tender,<br/>
That bitter day when life shall end,<br/>
When to the grave we must surrender,<br/>
And fear and pain our hearts shall rend.<br/>
The shield of faith do Thou bestow<br/>
When trembling we must meet the foe.<br/>
<br/>
When earthly help no more availeth,<br/>
To sup with us Thou wilt be nigh;<br/>
Thou givest strength that never faileth,<br/>
In Thee we grave and death defy.<br/>
While earth is fading from our sight,<br/>
Our eyes behold the realms of light.<br/>

Though broken and sin-marred. <br/>

Though hard the cross, the burden great,<br/>
And I so weak, so poor, undone;<br/>
Yet on Thy side I’ll stand and wait,<br/>
Till victory is won. <br/>

Though foe may kill us; yet I see<br/>
Thy blood sets poor dead captives free,<br/>
Though fierce the war may be. <br/>

Abode of peace, my Father’s home forever!<br/>
My weary soul in faith doth yearn for thee.<br/>

There is on earth no peaceful rest;<br/>
Our faith is weak, our souls oppressed,<br/>
Our vision dim and failing,<br/>
Our vision dim and failing.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord be praised that time so swiftly flieth;<br/>
God’s promise is fulfilled forevermore.<br/>
Who on God’s Word and promises relieth<br/>
Shall find at last the choicest wine in store.<br/>
Forgotten then is all distress,<br/>
Eternal peace and happiness<br/>
Shall then be ours forever,<br/>
Shall then be ours forever.<br/>
<br/>
Then, keep my heart forever, O my Savior,<br/>
And let me never, Lord, from Thee depart.<br/>
In joy, in pain, in sorrow, now and ever,<br/>
Thou only givest solace to my heart.<br/>
For when, O Lord, I am with Thee,<br/>
All other comforts well may flee;<br/>
With Thee I’m blest forever,<br/>
With Thee I’m blest forever.<br/>

Above all the roar of the cities,<br/>
And over the hills and the dells,<br/>
With a message of peace to the nations,<br/>
Ring the beautiful Bethlehem bells,<br/>
Bringing joy to the souls that are sighing<br/>
In hovels where poverty dwells—<br/>
There is life, there is life for the dying<br/>
In the beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>

Refrain<br/>

Beautiful Bethlehem bells;<br/>
Beautiful bells, beautiful bells,<br/>
Beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>

Far off in a land that is lovely,<br/>
For the tender, sweet story it tells,<br/>
In the light of a glorious morning,<br/>
Rang the beautiful Bethlehem bells;<br/>
And still in the hearts of creation<br/>
An anthem exultingly swells<br/>
At that memory sweet of the ringing<br/>
Of the beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
They rang o’er the hills and the valleys,<br/>
They summoned the glad world that day,<br/>
From the regions of night to the manger,<br/>
Where the beautiful Child Jesus lay;<br/>

A wonderful melody dwells<br/>
In the tender, sweet ringing and singing<br/>
Of the beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>

Above the hills of time the cross is gleaming,<br/>
Fair as the sun when night has turned to day;<br/>
And from it love’s pure light is richly streaming,<br/>
To cleanse the heart and banish sin away.<br/>
To this dear cross the eyes of men are turning,<br/>
Today as in the ages lost to sight;<br/>
And for Thee, O Christ, men’s hearts are yearning,<br/>
As shipwrecked seamen yearn for morning light.<br/>
<br/>
The cross, O Christ, Thy wondrous love revealing,<br/>
Awakes our hearts as with the light of morn,<br/>
And pardon o’er our sinful spirits stealing,<br/>
Tells us that we, in Thee, have been reborn.<br/>
Like echoes to sweet temple bells replying<br/>
Our hearts, O Lord, make answer to Thy love;<br/>
And we will love Thee with a love undying,<br/>
Till we are gathered to Thy home above.<br/>

Above the starry spheres,<br/>
To where He was before,<br/>
Christ had gone up, the Father’s gift<br/>
Upon the Church to pour.<br/>
<br/>
At length had fully come,<br/>
On mystic circle borne<br/>
Of seven times seven revolving days,<br/>
The Pentecostal morn.<br/>
<br/>
When, as the Apostles knelt<br/>
At the third hour in prayer,<br/>
A sudden rushing sound proclaimed<br/>
That God Himself was there.<br/>
<br/>
Forthwith a tongue of fire<br/>
Is seen on every brow,<br/>
Each heart receives the Father’s light,<br/>
The Word’s enkindling glow.<br/>
<br/>
The Holy Ghost on all<br/>
Is mightily outpoured,<br/>
Who straight in divers tongues declare<br/>
The wonders of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
While strangers of all climes<br/>
Flock round from far and near,<br/>
And their own tongue, wherever born,<br/>
All with amazement hear.<br/>
<br/>
But Judah, faithless still,<br/>
Denies the hand divine;<br/>
And, mocking, jeers the saints of Christ<br/>
As full of new made wine.<br/>
<br/>
Till Peter, in the midst,<br/>
By Joel’s ancient word,<br/>
Rebukes their unbelief, and wins<br/>
Three thousand to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The Father and the Son<br/>
And Spirit we adore,<br/>
O may the Spirit’s gifts be poured<br/>
On us forevermore.<br/>

Great calmness there, sweet patience, too,<br/>
Upon Thy face I see;<br/>
I would be calm and patient, Lord,<br/>
O lift me up to Thee!<br/>
<br/>
I am not weary of Thy work,<br/>
From earth I would not flee;<br/>
But while I walk and while I serve,<br/>
O lift me up to Thee!<br/>
<br/>
That I may bless my tender friends,<br/>
And those who love not me;<br/>
But while I walk and while I serve,<br/>
O lift me up to Thee!<br/>
<br/>
Whatever falls of good or ill,<br/>
Thy hand, Thy care I see,<br/>
And while these varied dealings pass,<br/>
O lift me up to Thee!<br/>
<br/>
And when my eyes close for the last,<br/>
Still this my prayer shall be:<br/>
Dear Savior, lift my spirit up,<br/>
And lift me up to Thee!<br/>

Above thine own ambitions here<br/>
Another voice is sounding clear;<br/>
It is the call of God to thee:<br/>
O leave thy all, and follow Me!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Go thro' with God, thy vows to pay,<br/>
Thy life upon the altar lay;<br/>
The Holy Ghost will do the rest,<br/>
And bring to thee God's very best!<br/>
<br/>
The call of God, it is so clear,<br/>
But friendships call, and home is dear;<br/>
Ah, lonely was the path He trod,<br/>
Then wilt thou not go on with God?<br/>
<br/>
So soon eternal morn shall dawn,<br/>
How fast the night is hast'ning on;<br/>
So soon His lovely face to see,<br/>
How sad to empty-handed be!<br/>
<br/>
The price is high, severe the test<br/>
For those who would enjoy God's best;<br/>
Surrender all, then take the road<br/>
With those who will go thro' with God. <br/>

Above yon clear blue sky,<br/>
Beyond our feeble sight,<br/>
The God of glory dwells on high<br/>
In everlasting light.<br/>
Around His glorious throne<br/>
The holy angels stand;<br/>
In songs of praise their King they own,<br/>
Or fly at His command.<br/>
<br/>
And we may praise Him, too,<br/>
And serve Him here below;<br/>
He stoops to mark what children do,<br/>
Their inmost thoughts to know;<br/>
And though He reigns above,<br/>
Where angels ceaseless praise,<br/>
He will accept our humble love,<br/>
And lead us in His ways.<br/>
<br/>
O may we humbly seek<br/>
To do His holy will,<br/>
And try, with thankful hearts and meek,<br/>
To sing His praises still;<br/>
And then for Jesus’ sake,<br/>
Who came for us to die,<br/>
Our happy spirits He will take<br/>
To praise Him in the sky.<br/>

The Lord woke Abraham 
one night, <br/>
And told the man to take <br/>
The promised Isaac his one son, <br/>
To kill for God’s great sake. <br/>
<br/>
Then Abraham his son did take; <br/>
The boy was unaware, <br/>
He calmly walked the mountain steep; <br/>
His son did not despair. <br/>
<br/>
But as he raised the deadly knife <br/>
His only son to slay, <br/>
“Don’t kill the boy!" The Lord called down <br/>
In bright and shining ray. <br/>
<br/>
Christ Jesus offered up himself <br/>
Like Isaac Abr’ms son; <br/>
And shining forth he rose again, <br/>
And conquered all our sins. <br/>

Absent from flesh! O blissful thought!<br/>
What unknown joys this moment brings!<br/>
Freed from the mischiefs sin has brought,<br/>
From pains, and fears, and all their springs.<br/>
<br/>
Absent from flesh! illustrious day!<br/>
Surprising scene! triumphant stroke<br/>
That rends the prison of my clay;<br/>
And I can feel my fetters broke.<br/>
<br/>
Absent from flesh! then rise, my soul,<br/>
Where feet nor wings could never climb,<br/>
Beyond the heav’ns, where planets roll,<br/>
Measuring the cares and joys of time.<br/>
<br/>
I go where God and glory shine,<br/>
His presence makes eternal day:<br/>
My all that’s mortal I resign,<br/>
For angels wait and point my way.<br/>

Under the burdens of guilt and care<br/>
Many a spirit is grieving,<br/>
Who in the joy of the Lord might share,<br/>
Life everlasting receiving.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Life, life, eternal life!<br/>
Jesus alone is the giver;<br/>

Glory to Jesus forever!<br/>

Bearing our burden of guilt,<br/>
there came One who is strong to deliver;<br/>
Bringing to men, through His wondrous name,<br/>
Life "more abundant" than ever.<br/>
<br/>
Burdened one, why will you longer bear<br/>
Sorrows from which He releases?<br/>
Open your heart and, rejoicing,<br/>
share Life "more abundant" in Jesus!<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows,<br/>
Flooding the vale with a river;<br/>
So, from the hill of the cross there flows<br/>
Life "more abundant" for ever.<br/>

O for the floods on the thirsty land!<br/>
O for a mighty revival!<br/>
O for a sanctified, fearless band,<br/>
Ready to hail its arrival! https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/accept_one_another.php



When you are going to judge<br/>
You need to take a second look<br/>
Not at your brother's speck<br/>
But the warning that's in The Book<br/>
'Cause who alone can judge<br/>
Except the One who knows our mind?<br/>
He knows the inner man<br/>
And difficulties we may find <br/>
<br/>
So often we condemn (Condemn)<br/>
And our minds are never in gear (Minds are never in gear)<br/>
Our feelings then are led (Are led)<br/>
By suspicious, crippling fear (Suspicious, crippling)<br/>
To love our brothers now (Now)<br/>
We've got to use our Master's eyes (Eyes)<br/>
So we will not condemn<br/>
The result will be a surprise when we... <br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
Accept one another without judging your brother<br/>
The Lord has been good to you<br/>
Accept one another without judging your brother<br/>
It's the Godly thing you ought to do<br/>
Accept one another without judging your brother<br/>
There's no need to cause a fight<br/>
Accept one another without judging your brother<br/>
It's the Godly way of living right <br/>
<br/>
What do you want yourself (What do you want?)<br/>
When it comes right down to a choice?<br/>
Is judgement what you want (What you want)<br/>
Or a kind and merciful voice (Merciful voice)<br/>
To tell you that they care<br/>
And are overlooking the bad?<br/>
They know your faults so well<br/>
But are accepting you instead <br/>
<br/>
And now we leave with your choice<br/>
Won't you tell me what'll you do? (What'll you do?)<br/>
The measures that you use<br/>
Is the measure that's used for you<br/>
So when you're prone to judge<br/>
Won't you think of this simple song<br/>
Before you make mistakes<br/>
By judging and treating them wrong, instead... <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus <br/>
<br/>
When you think of what He's done<br/>
Givin' up His only son<br/>
Livin' in a world of hate<br/>
How can you retaliate?<br/>
Knowing what he's done for me<br/>
Following His legacy<br/>
I'm gonna rise above<br/>
Accepting those that He has loved <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus <br/>
<br/>
It's the Godly way of living right<br/>
It's the Godly way of living right <br/>

As I come, O Savior, pleading<br/>
That my soul thou shouldst restore,<br/>
All I have I now am bringing,<br/>
Thine to be forevermore.<br/>
 <br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Thou hast said Thou wouldst receive me,<br/>
Nor my earnest plea deny;<br/>

From the world have turned aside;<br/>
Let me be a holy temple,<br/>
Where Thy presence may abide. <br/>

I am hoping in Thy mercy,<br/>
Not in that which I can do;<br/>
And I know Thou failest never,<br/>

And no longer am afraid. <br/>

According to thy gracious word,<br/>

Thy body, broken for my sake,<br/>
my bread from heaven shall be;<br/>
thy testamental cup I take,<br/>
and thus remember thee.<br/>
<br/>
Gethsemane can I forget?<br/>
Or there thy conflict see,<br/>
thine agony and bloody sweat,<br/>
and not remember thee?<br/>
<br/>
When to the cross I turn mine eyes<br/>
and rest on Calvary;<br/>
O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,<br/>
I must remember thee.<br/>
<br/>
Remember thee, and all thy pains,<br/>
and all thy love to me;<br/>
yea, while I have a breath, a pulse remains,<br/>
will I remember thee.<br/>

And when these failing lips grow dumb,<br/>
and mind and memory flee,<br/>
when thou shalt in thy kingdom come,<br/>

All around this world I've traveled<br/>
Through it all I've come to find<br/>
The ties that bind can come unraveled<br/>
I've had to face some lonely times<br/>
But when I'm tired and feeling low<br/>
Oh what a comfort it is to know <br/>
Across the miles there's someone praying for me<br/>
Across the miles there's someone on their knees<br/>
Lifting my name to the Lord above<br/>
In joy and pain I can feel the love<br/>
And see you smile<br/>
Across the miles <br/>
Life can be so complicated<br/>
Walking through it on your own<br/>
When kindred hearts are separated<br/>
It gives love a chance to grow<br/>
And even though I'm so far away<br/>
Oh I'm reminded every day <br/>
Across the miles there's someone praying for me<br/>
Across the miles there's someone on their knees<br/>
Lifting my name to the Lord above<br/>
In joy and pain I can feel the love<br/>
And see you smile<br/>
Across the miles<br/>
Across the miles<br/>
Across the miles <br/>

Across the sky the shades of night<br/>
This New Year’s Eve are fleeting,<br/>
We deck Thine altar, Lord, with light,<br/>
In solemn worship meeting;<br/>
And as the year’s last hours go by,<br/>
We raise to Thee our earnest cry,<br/>
Once more Thy love entreating.<br/>
<br/>
Before the cross subdued we bow,<br/>
To Thee our prayers addressing,<br/>
Recounting all Thy mercies now,<br/>
And all our sins confessing;<br/>
Beseeching Thee this coming year<br/>
To keep us in Thy faith and fear<br/>
And crown us with Thy blessing.<br/>
<br/>
And while we pray, we lift our eyes<br/>
To dear ones gone before us,<br/>
Safe home with thee in paradise,<br/>
Whose peace descendeth o’er us;<br/>
And beg of Thee, when life is past,<br/>
To reunite us all at last<br/>
With those who’ve gone before us.<br/>
<br/>
We gather up in this brief hour<br/>
The memory of Thy mercies;<br/>
Thy wondrous goodness, love and power<br/>
Our grateful song rehearses;<br/>
For Thou hast been our Strength and Stay<br/>
In many a dark and dreary day<br/>
Of sorrow and reverses.<br/>
<br/>
In many an hour when fear and dread,<br/>
Like evil spells, have bound us<br/>
And clouds were gathering overhead,<br/>
Thy providence hath found us.<br/>
In many a night when seas ran high,<br/>
Thy gracious presence, drawing nigh,<br/>
Hath made all calm around us.<br/>
<br/>
Then, O great God, in years to come,<br/>
Whatever may betide us,<br/>
Right onward through our journey home<br/>
Be Thou at hand to guide us;<br/>
Nor leave us till at close of life,<br/>
Safe from all perils, toil, and strife,<br/>
Heaven shall enfold and hide us.<br/>

It was an act of God<br/>
This old world was not an accident<br/>
It came to be by the touch of His hand<br/>
Through His love He formed creation<br/>
Then reached out and breathed His life into man<br/>
Yes for all of us<br/>
He is calling us with His blessings to show<br/>
The best part of it is the heart of it<br/>
It's the good news we know<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
Every time the sun shows His face<br/>
Every time I've needed His grace<br/>
Every little bird in the air<br/>
Never will escape from His care<br/>
He arose again He defeated sin<br/>
And He shed His blood for me<br/>
It was an act of God<br/>
<br/>
Now we hear such strange philosophies<br/>
From those who teach - we expect them to know<br/>
But they push God out of the picture<br/>
When His presence is quite obvious <br/>
Only fools deny Him so<br/>
<br/>
And in all of us there's a call in us<br/>
For the truth to be shown<br/>
Yes the heart of it - every part of it<br/>
Is from God's highest throne<br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus<br/>
<br/>
(I've got to know...)<br/>
Was it an act of God - causing you to turn Him away? <br/>
Is it an act of God - that you're refusing to pray?<br/>
It was an act of God - opening the blind eyes to see<br/>
It is an act of God - what He is doing for me<br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus<br/>
<br/>
I know<br/>
He arose again He defeated sin<br/>
And he's coming back for me <br/>
It is an act of God<br/>
Oh it, it is an act of God <br/>

Adam, our father and our head,<br/>
Transgressed, and justice doomed us dead;<br/>
The fiery law speaks all despair:<br/>
There’s no reprieve nor pardon there.<br/>
<br/>
But, O unutterable grace!<br/>
The Son of God takes Adam’s place;<br/>
Down to our world the Savior flies,<br/>
Stretches His arms, and bleeds, and dies.<br/>
<br/>
Justice was pleased to bruise the God,<br/>
And pay its wrongs with heav’nly blood:<br/>
What unknown racks and pangs He bore!<br/>
Then rose; the law could ask no more.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing work! look down, ye skies,<br/>
Wonder and gaze with all your eyes;<br/>
Ye heav’nly thrones, stoop from above,<br/>
And bow to this mysterious love.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! they adore th’incarnate Son,<br/>
And sing the glories He hath won;<br/>
Sing how He broke our iron chains,<br/>
How deep He sunk, how high He reigns!<br/>
<br/>
Triumph and reign, victorious Lord,<br/>
By all the flaming hosts adored;<br/>
And say, dear Conqueror, say how long<br/>
Ere we shall rise to join their song.<br/>
<br/>
Send down a chariot from above,<br/>
With fiery wheels, and paved with love;<br/>
Raise us beyond th’ethereal blue,<br/>
To sing and love as angels do.<br/>

Adore and tremble, for 
our God<br/>
Is a consuming fire!<br/>
His jealous eyes His wrath inflame,<br/>
And raise His vengeance higher.<br/>
<br/>
Almighty vengeance, how it burns!<br/>
How bright His fury glows!<br/>
Vast magazines of plagues and storms<br/>
Lie treasured for his foes.<br/>
<br/>
Those heaps of wrath, by slow degrees,<br/>
Are forced into a flame;<br/>
But kindled, oh! how fierce they blaze!<br/>
And rend all nature’s frame.<br/>
<br/>
At His approach the mountains flee,<br/>
And seek a watery grave:<br/>
The frighted sea makes haste away,<br/>
And shrinks up every wave.<br/>
<br/>
Through the wide air the mighty rocks<br/>
Are swift as hailstones hurled;<br/>
Who dares engage His fiery rage<br/>
That shakes the solid world?<br/>
<br/>
Yet, mighty God, Thy sovereign grace<br/>
Sits regent on the throne;<br/>
The refuge of Thy chosen race<br/>
When wrath comes rushing down.<br/>
<br/>
Thy hand shall on rebellious kings<br/>
A fiery tempest pour,<br/>
While we beneath Thy sheltering wings<br/>
Thy just revenge adore.<br/>

The advent of our God<br/>

Our prayers must now employ,<br/>
And we must meet Him on His road<br/>
With hymns of holy joy.<br/>
<br/>
The everlasting Son<br/>
Incarnate deigns to be;<br/>
Himself a servant’s form puts on<br/>
To set His people free.<br/>
<br/>
Daughter of Zion, rise<br/>
To meet thy lowly King,<br/>
Nor let thy faithless heart despise<br/>
The peace He comes to bring.<br/>
<br/>
As Judge, on clouds of light,<br/>
He soon will come again,<br/>
And all His scattered saints unite<br/>
With Him in Heaven to reign.<br/>
<br/>
Before the dawning day<br/>
Let sin’s dark deeds be gone;<br/>
The old man all be put away,<br/>
The new man all put on.<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Son<br/>
Who comes to set us free,<br/>
With Father, Spirit, ever One,<br/>
Through all eternity.<br/>

As the 
days grow shorter and darkness descends, <br/>
The world refuses to comprehend. <br/>
Instead they celebrate with noise and glee; <br/>
A holiday without the Nativity. <br/>
<br/>
(chorus): <br/>
<br/>
We will fast and give alms as they did long ago, <br/>
We'll feel much lighter, <br/>
Our spirits grow brighter; <br/>
Our hearts will be all aglow. <br/>
<br/>
'Tis a special time to watch and wait; <br/>
It is not yet time to celebrate. <br/>
We must strive to bring His love to a world full of hate; <br/>
Draw close to the Savior before it's too late. <br/>
<br/>
(chorus) <br/>
<br/>
This mystery we cannot comprehend; <br/>
That the Father his dear Son He would lend <br/>
To be battered and buffeted and hung on a cross; <br/>
The world still hates Him, to its great loss. <br/>
<br/>
(chorus) <br/>
<br/>
As the time of His blessed Nativity approaches <br/>
We must patiently bear the world's reproaches; <br/>
And watch for His holy birth with awe: <br/>
The Savior who came to fulfill the law. <br/>
<br/>
(chorus) <br/>
<br/>
We wait for this sacred mystery to unfold: <br/>
The incarnation from ages untold. <br/>
Then we will celebrate with gladness and joy <br/>
That Christ our Savior was born a baby boy. <br/>
<br/>
(chorus) <br/>

Advent tells us Christ 
is near;<br/>
Christmas tells us Christ is here!<br/>
In Epiphany we trace<br/>
all the glory of his grace.<br/>
<br/>
Those three Sundays before Lent<br/>
will prepare us to repent;<br/>
that in Lent we may begin<br/>
earnestly to mourn for sin.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Week and Easter, then,<br/>
tell who died and rose agin;<br/>
O that happy Easter Day!<br/>
"Christ is risen indeed," we say.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and Christ ascended, too,<br/>
to prepare a place for you;<br/>
so, we give him special praise,<br/>
after those great Forty Days.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he sent the Holy Ghost,<br/>
on the Day of Pentecost,<br/>
with us ever to abide;<br/>
well may we keep Whitsuntide!<br/>
<br/>
Last of all, we humbly sing<br/>
glory to our God and King,<br/>
glory to the One in Three,<br/>
on the Feast of Trinity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Affirm anew the 
threefold name<br/>
pf Father, Spirit, Son,<br/>
our God whose saving acts proclaim<br/>
a world's salvation won.<br/>
In him alone we live and move<br/>
and breath and being find,<br/>
the wayward children of his love<br/>
who cares for humankind.<br/>
<br/>
Declare in all the earth his grace,<br/>
to every heart his call,<br/>
the living Lord of time and place<br/>
whose love embraces all.<br/>
So shall his endless praise be sung,<br/>
his teaching truly heard,<br/>
and every culture, every tongue,<br/>
receive his timeless word.<br/>
<br/>
Confirm our faith in this our day<br/>
amid earth's shifting sand,<br/>
with Christ as life and truth and way,<br/>
a rock on which to stand;<br/>
the one eternal Son and Lord<br/>
by God the Father given,<br/>
the true and life-imparting word,<br/>
the way that leads to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Renew once more the ancient fire,<br/>
let love our hearts inflame;<br/>
renew, restore, unite, inspire<br/>
the church that bears your name;<br/>
one name exalted over all,<br/>
one Father, Spirit, Son,<br/>
O grant us grace to heed your call<br/>
and in that name be one.https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/afflictedsaint.php
Afflicted saint, to Christ draw near—<br/>
Thy Savior’s gracious promise hear,<br/>
His faithful Word declares to thee,<br/>
That as thy days thy strength shall be.<br/>
<br/>
Let not thy heart despond and say<br/>
“How shall I stand the trying day?"<br/>
He has engaged by firm decree,<br/>
That as thy days thy strength shall be.<br/>
<br/>
Thy faith is weak, thy foes are strong,<br/>
And if the conflict should be long,<br/>
The Lord will make the tempter flee,<br/>
For as thy days thy strength shall be.<br/>
<br/>
Should persecution rage and flame,<br/>
Still trust in thy Redeemer’s Name;<br/>
In fiery trials thou shalt see,<br/>
That as thy days thy strength shall be.<br/>
<br/>
When called to bear thy weighty cross,<br/>
Or sore affliction, pain, or loss,<br/>
Or deep distress or poverty,<br/>
Still as thy days thy strength shall be.<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/afflictions_do_not_come_alone.php
Afflictions do not come alone,<br/>
A voice attends the rod;<br/>
By both He to His saints is known,<br/>
A Father and a God!<br/>
Let not My children slight the stroke<br/>
I for chastisement send;<br/>
Nor faint beneath My kind rebuke,<br/>
For still I am their Friend.<br/>
<br/>
The wicked I perhaps may leave<br/>
Awhile, and not reprove;<br/>
But all the children I receive<br/>
I scourge, because I love.<br/>
<br/>
If therefore you were left without<br/>
This needful discipline;<br/>
You might, with cause, admit a doubt,<br/>
If you, indeed, were Mine.<br/>
<br/>
Shall earthly parents then expect<br/>
Their children to submit?<br/>
And wilt not you, when I correct,<br/>
Be humbled at My feet?<br/>
<br/>
To please themselves they oft chastise,<br/>
And put their sons to pain;<br/>
But you are precious in My eyes,<br/>
And shall not smart in vain.<br/>
<br/>
I see your hearts, at present, filled<br/>
With grief, and deep distress;<br/>
But soon these bitter seeds shall yield<br/>
The fruits of righteousness.<br/>
<br/>
Break through the clouds, dear Lord, and shine!<br/>
Let us perceive Thee nigh!<br/>
And to each mourning child of Thine<br/>
These gracious words apply.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/afflictionsthoughtheyseemsevere.php
Afflictions, though they seem severe;<br/>
In mercy oft are sent;<br/>
They stopped the prodigal’s career,<br/>
And forced him to repent.<br/>
<br/>
Although he no relentings felt<br/>
Till he had spent his store;<br/>
His stubborn heart began to melt<br/>
When famine pinched him sore.<br/>
<br/>
“What have I gained by sin, he said,<br/>
But hunger, shame, and fear;<br/>
My father’s house abounds with bread,<br/>
While I am starving here.<br/>
<br/>
I’ll go, and tell him all I’ve done,<br/>
And fall before his face<br/>
Unworthy to be called his son,<br/>
I’ll seek a servant’s place."<br/>
<br/>
His father saw him coming back,<br/>
He saw, and ran, and smiled;<br/>
And threw his arms around the neck<br/>
Of his rebellious child.<br/>
<br/>
“Father, I’ve sinned—but O forgive!"<br/>
I’ve heard enough, he said,<br/>
Rejoice my house, my son’s alive,<br/>
For whom I mourned as dead.<br/>
<br/>
Now let the fatted calf be slain,<br/>
And spread the news around;<br/>
My son was dead, but lives again,<br/>
Was lost, but now is found.<br/>
<br/>

’Tis thus the Lord His love reveals,<br/>
To call poor sinners home;<br/>
More than a father’s love He feels,<br/>
And welcomes all that come.<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/afterdeaththejudgment.php



Stop, sinner, on your sinful way,<br/>
And heed the warning voice today;<br/>
Oh, come to Jesus while you may,<br/>
For after death the judgment. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
After death the judgment,<br/>
After death the judgment;<br/>
After death the judgment,<br/>
Oh, will you be prepared? <br/>
<br/>
Oh, reason, sinner, will it pay<br/>
To cast your only hope away,<br/>
And on in sinful darkness stray,<br/>
When after death the judgment? <br/>
<br/>
Oh, think, what will the profit be,<br/>
If you should all earth’s pleasures see,<br/>
And lose your soul eternally,<br/>
When Jesus comes in judgment. <br/>
<br/>
The end of time draws on apace,<br/>
And your poor soul, devoid of grace,<br/>
The awful wrath of God must face,<br/>
When Jesus comes in judgment.

After the mist and shadow,<br/>
After the dreary night,<br/>
After the sleepless watching,<br/>
Cometh the morning light;<br/>
Beautiful, soft and tender,<br/>
Leading the soul along,<br/>
Over the silent river,<br/>
Into the land of song.<br/>

After the thorny pathway,<br/>
After the storms we meet,<br/>
After the heart’s deep longing,<br/>
Joy and communion sweet;<br/>
After the weary conflict,<br/>
Rest in the Savior’s love,<br/>
Over the silent river,<br/>
Safe in the home above.<br/>

After the cares and trials,<br/>
After the toils and tears,<br/>
After the time of sowing,<br/>
Reaping thro’ endless years;<br/>
After the pilgrim journey,<br/>
Rapture that ne’er shall cease,<br/>
Over the silent river,<br/>
Rest in the land of peace.<br/>

Troubles confound us, make heavy our load <br/>
Fetters that bound us, no longer will goad<br/>

After the sunrise, happy we'll be - we know <br/>

Again, as evening’s shadow falls,<br/>
We gather in these hallowed walls;<br/>
And vesper hymn and vesper prayer<br/>
Rise mingling on the holy air.<br/>
<br/>
May struggling hearts that seek release<br/>
Here find the rest of God’s own peace;<br/>
And, strengthened here by hymn and prayer,<br/>
Lay down the burden and the care.<br/>
<br/>
O God, our Light! to Thee we bow;<br/>
Within all shadows standest Thou;<br/>
Give deeper calm than night can bring;<br/>
Give sweeter songs than lips can sing.<br/>
<br/>
Life’s tumult we must meet again,<br/>
We cannot at the shrine remain;<br/>
But in the spirit’s secret cell<br/>
May hymn and prayer forever dwell.<br/>

To learn His will, and all we learn obey;<br/>
So shall He hear, when fervently we raise<br/>
Our supplications and our songs of praise.<br/>

In life our Guardian, and in death our Friend,<br/>

Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled<br/>
Within my heart, that it may be<br/>
A quiet chamber kept for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
My heart for very joy doth leap,<br/>
My lips no more can silence keep;<br/>
I, too, must sing with joyful tongue<br/>
That sweetest ancient cradle song.<br/>

Glory to God in highest Heaven,<br/>
Who unto man His Son hath given;<br/>

Ah, holy Jesus, how hast Thou offended,<br/>
That man to judge Thee hath in hate pretended?<br/>
By foes derided, by Thine own rejected,<br/>
O most afflicted.<br/>
<br/>
Who was the guilty? Who brought this upon Thee?<br/>
Alas, my treason, Jesus, hath undone Thee.<br/>
’Twas I, Lord, Jesus, I it was denied Thee!<br/>
I crucified Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered;<br/>
The slave hath sinned, and the Son hath suffered;<br/>
For man’s atonement, while he nothing heedeth,<br/>
God intercedeth.<br/>
<br/>
For me, kind Jesus, was Thy incarnation,<br/>
Thy mortal sorrow, and Thy life’s oblation;<br/>
Thy death of anguish and Thy bitter passion,<br/>
For my salvation.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, kind Jesus, since I cannot pay Thee,<br/>
I do adore Thee, and will ever pray Thee,<br/>
Think on Thy pity and Thy love unswerving,<br/>
Not my deserving.<br/>

Ah! Lord God, the world’s Creator,<br/>
King of all, great or small,<br/>
Earth’s Regenerator;<br/>
Art Thou cradled, art Thou crying,<br/>
Swathed and bound, on the ground,<br/>
In the stable lying?<br/>
<br/>
“Love of man hath brought Me hither,<br/>
Cords of love, from above,<br/>
To exalt him thither;<br/>
Dead in trespass, child, I sought thee;<br/>
Gone astray, from My way,<br/>
Life and pardon brought thee."<br/>
<br/>
“Empty be My scrip and coffer,<br/>
Yet ’tis wealth, plenty, health,<br/>
I am come to offer;<br/>
Haste I to enrich and dress thee;<br/>
Born to die, low I lie,<br/>
And would gladly bless thee."<br/>
<br/>
Therefore thousand thousand praises<br/>
Are Thy due, Babe Jesu,<br/>
These my heart upraises;<br/>
Angels, mortals, furthest, nighest,<br/>
Sing in mirth, “Peace on earth,<br/>
Glory in the highest."<br/>

Ah, what can I do, or where be secure?<br/>
If justice pursue, what heart can endure?<br/>
When God speaks in thunder and makes Himself known,<br/>
The heart breaks asunder though hard as a stone.<br/>
<br/>
With terror I read my sins’ heavy score,<br/>
The numbers exceed the sands on the shore;<br/>
Guilt makes me unable to stand or to flee,<br/>
So Cain murdered Abel, and trembled like me.<br/>
<br/>
Each sin, like his blood, with terrible cry,<br/>
Calls loudly on God to strike from on high:<br/>
Nor can my repentance, extorted by fear,<br/>
Reverse the just sentence; ’tis just, though severe.<br/>
<br/>
The case is too plain, I have my own choice;<br/>
Again, and again I slighted His voice;<br/>
His warnings neglected, His patience abused,<br/>
His Gospel rejected, His mercy refused.<br/>
<br/>
And must I then go, forever to dwell<br/>
In torments and woe with devils in hell?<br/>
Oh where is the Savior I scorned in times past?<br/>
His word in my favor would save me at last.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Jesus, on Thee I venture to call,<br/>

Oh look upon me, the vilest of all!<br/>
For whom didst Thou languish and bleed on the tree?<br/>
Oh pity my anguish, and say, “’Twas for thee."<br/>
<br/>
A case such as mine will honor Thy power;<br/>
All hell will repine, all Heav’n will adore;<br/>

It shines in salvation more glorious through grace.<br/>

Ah, whence to me the bliss,<br/>
The joy, the heav'nly sweetness,<br/>
That now in torrents pure,<br/>
My heart o'erflows,<br/>
My soul oh be thou silent,<br/>
'Tis thy own sweet Jesus,<br/>
Who comes to thee this morn,<br/>
To be thy sweet repose.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Jesus I adore Thee,<br/>
Within my happy heart,<br/>
To me, O Tender Jesus,<br/>
Thy grace and love impart.<br/>
<br/>
My King art Thou sweet Lord,<br/>
Though hidden be Thy splendor,<br/>
Its radiance ever clear,<br/>
In bliss doth shine.<br/>
And lowly 'mid its brightness,<br/>
Trembling here before Thee,<br/>
I kneel and humbly beg,<br/>
To taste the sacred stream.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Jesus I adore Thee,<br/>
Within my happy heart,<br/>
To me, O Tender Jesus,<br/>
Thy grace and love impart.<br/>
<br/>
When death in terror comes,<br/>
And folds me in its darkness,<br/>
When earth and friends depart,<br/>
Wilt Thou be near?<br/>
Ah, then, in Thy compassion,<br/>
Turn Thine eyes upon me,<br/>
And bid me come to Thee,<br/>
Then call, then let me hear.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Jesus I adore Thee,<br/>
Within my happy heart,<br/>
To me, O Tender Jesus,<br/>
Thy grace and love impart.<br/>

Ah! whither should I go,<br/>
Burdened and sick and faint?<br/>
To whom should I my trouble show,<br/>
And pour out my complaint?<br/>
My Savior bids me come;<br/>
Ah! why do I delay?<br/>
He calls the weary sinner home,<br/>
And yet from Him I stay.<br/>
<br/>
What is it keeps me back,<br/>
From which I cannot part,<br/>
Which will not let the Savior take<br/>
Possession of my heart?<br/>
Searcher of hearts, in mine<br/>
Thy trying power display;<br/>
Into its darkest corners shine,<br/>
And take the veil away.<br/>
<br/>
I now believe in Thee,<br/>
Compassion reigns alone;<br/>
According to my faith, to me<br/>
O let it, Lord, be done!<br/>
In me is all the bar,<br/>
Which Thou wouldst fain remove;<br/>
Remove it, and I shall declare<br/>
That God is only love.https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/aint_a_that_good_news.php

[G] So you think you paid the baker for the bread you [C] ate to [G] day<br/>
And you think you paid the miller for the [D] grain<br/>
But no [G] body paid the maker for the things that [C] made it [G] grow<br/>
Like the air and the [D] sunshine and the [G] rain.<br/>

CHORUS:<br/>
Now you don't [C] grumble when you pay your room and [G] board<br/>
When the land Lord comes around you don't com [D] plain<br/>
So the [G] least you can do is thank the [C] Lord<br/>
For the [G] air and the [D] sunshine and the [G] rain.<br/>
<br/>
As you travel down the highway in a bright and shiny car<br/>
Makes no difference if it's Cadillac or Ford<br/>
You must pay for oil and gasoline but air and water's free<br/>
Don't you think that you should pause and thank the Lord.<br/>

Alabare, alabare, alabare a mi Senor[2]<br/>
[I'll praise my Lord, for ever more!]<br/>
John saw the number, of all those who redeemed,<br/>
And all were singing praises to the Lord,<br/>
Thousands were praying,<br/>
Ten thousands rejoicing<br/>
And all were singing praises to the Lord<br/>
There is no God as great as You, O Lord,<br/>
There is none, there is none!<br/>
[repeat]<br/>
There is no God who does the mighty wonders<br/>
That the Lord our God has done [repeat]<br/>
Not with an army, nor with their weapons,<br/>

Alas! and did my Savior bleed<br/>
And did my Sovereign die?<br/>
Would He devote that sacred head<br/>
For sinners such as I?<br/>
[originally, For such a worm as I?]<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,<br/>
And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br/>
It was there by faith I received my sight,<br/>
And now I am happy all the day!<br/>
<br/>
Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, Thine—<br/>
And bathed in its own blood—<br/>
While the firm mark of wrath divine,<br/>
His Soul in anguish stood.<br/>
<br/>
Was it for crimes that I had done<br/>
He groaned upon the tree?<br/>
Amazing pity! grace unknown!<br/>
And love beyond degree!<br/>
<br/>
Well might the sun in darkness hide<br/>
And shut his glories in,<br/>
When Christ, the mighty Maker died,<br/>
For man the creature’s sin.<br/>
<br/>
Thus might I hide my blushing face<br/>
While His dear cross appears,<br/>
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,<br/>
And melt my eyes to tears.<br/>
<br/>
But drops of grief can ne’er repay<br/>
The debt of love I owe:<br/>
Here, Lord, I give my self away<br/>
’Tis all that I can do.<br/>

Alas! how swift the moments fly!<br/>
How flash the years along!<br/>
Scarce here, yet gone already by,<br/>
The burden of a song.<br/>
See childhood, youth, and manhood pass,<br/>
And age, with furrowed brow;<br/>
Time was—Time shall be—drain the glass—<br/>
But where in Time is now?<br/>
<br/>
Time is the measure but of change;<br/>
No present hour is found;<br/>
The past, the future, fill the range<br/>
Of Time’s unceasing round.<br/>
Where, then is now? In realms above,<br/>
With God’s atoning Lamb,<br/>
In regions of eternal love,<br/>
Where sits enthroned I AM.<br/>
<br/>
Then pilgrim, let thy joys and tears<br/>
On Time no longer lean;<br/>
But henceforth all thy hopes and fears<br/>
From earth’s affections wean:<br/>
To God let votive accents rise;<br/>
With truth, with virtue, live;<br/>
So all the bliss that Time denies<br/>
Eternity shall give.<br/>

To give or to withhold,<br/>

Enough that blessings undeserved<br/>
Have marked my erring track;<br/>
That, wheresoe’er my feet have swerved,<br/>
His chastening turned me back.<br/>

That more and more a providence<br/>
Of love is understood,<br/>
Making the springs of time and sense<br/>
Sweet with eternal good.<br/>

All beautiful the march of days, as seasons come and go;<br/>
The Hand that shaped the rose hath wrought the crystal of the snow;<br/>
Hath sent the hoary frost of Heav’n, the flowing waters sealed,<br/>
And laid a silent loveliness on hill and wood and field.<br/>
<br/>
O’er white expanses sparkling pure the radiant morns unfold;<br/>
The solemn splendors of the night burn brighter than the cold;<br/>
Life mounts in every throbbing vein, love deepens round the hearth,<br/>
And clearer sounds the angel hymn, “Good will to men on earth."<br/>
<br/>
O Thou from Whose unfathomed law the year in beauty flows,<br/>
Thyself the vision passing by in crystal and in rose,<br/>
Day unto day doth utter speech, and night to night proclaim,<br/>
In ever changing words of light, the wonder of Thy Name.<br/>

Many souls today are dying,<br/>
Sin and sorrow is their lot;<br/>
Darkness shrouds them with its mantle,<br/>
All because we love them not. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
All because we do not love them,<br/>
Millions fill the heathen grave;<br/>
Brother, can you see them perish,<br/>
When a little love would save? <br/>
<br/>
Brother, can we guiltless linger,<br/>
When to us the truth is giv’n?<br/>
Tearless, see the heathen dying,<br/>
Without God or hope of heav’n? <br/>
<br/>
Love brought Jesus down from glory,<br/>
On the cruel cross to die;<br/>
Can we say we love the heathen,<br/>
If we turn away their cry? <br/>
<br/>
Love undying, love eternal—<br/>
Love will send us o’er the wave,<br/>
Will impel us to our duty,<br/>
Helpless heathen souls to save. <br/>

They are lost if we delay;<br/>
Can we face Him at the judgment,<br/>
If His word we disobey? <br/>

All English children call Him, "Lord,"<br/>
And all the Spanish say, "Senor,"<br/>
With all the Germans who call Him, "Herr."<br/>
They are calling His name everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
"O Shuyo," call the Japanese,<br/>
"O Tju Ah," echo the Chinese,<br/>
"O Hallelujah," they all exclaim.<br/>
In each land they are praising His Name.<br/>

Children are meeting in Brazil,<br/>
Canada, Mexico, Taiwan,<br/>
England, New Zealand, and Germany.<br/>
Hear them all, as they sing joyfully.<br/>

All faded is the glowing light<br/>
That once from Heaven shone,<br/>
When startled shepherds in the night<br/>
The angels came upon.<br/>
O shine again, ye angel host,<br/>
And say that He is near;<br/>
Though but a simple few at most<br/>
Believe He will appear.<br/>
<br/>
Ye heavens, that have been growing dark,<br/>
Now also are ye dumb;<br/>
When shall the listeners say, “Hark!<br/>
They’re singing—He will come"?<br/>
<br/>
Lord, come again, O come again,<br/>
Come even as Thou wilt;<br/>
But not anew to suffer pain,<br/>
And strive with human guilt.<br/>
<br/>
O come again, Thou mighty King,<br/>
Let earth Thy glory see;<br/>
And let us hear the angels sing,<br/>
“He comes with victory."<br/>

Sometimes you misunderstand me<br/>
Yes, I feel misunderstood<br/>
You think that I'm not doin' things<br/>
Quite the way I should<br/>
Please know I'm only trying to do what's right<br/>
For my Father up above<br/>
I'm glad to have you smoothin' my rough edges<br/>
But please do it out of love<br/>
Because<br/>

Chorus:<br/>
It's all for the good<br/>
Yes it's all for the good<br/>
You know it's all<br/>
<br/>
Yes I take a Bible in the classroom<br/>
To show you I'm a Jesus freak<br/>
My only goal's to share the good news<br/>
With anyone who seeks<br/>
You hit me hard to try and stop me<br/>
Then turn to kiss the other cheek<br/>
I don't see how you could think<br/>
That I'm the one who's weak, no<br/>
But<br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Yes it's all for the good<br/>
All for the good<br/>
Yeah, it's all<br/>
<br/>
I know the day is coming<br/>
When all will be at peace<br/>
The lion will lay with the lamb<br/>
And colors then will cease<br/>
Until that day with God's help<br/>
We gotta to make all the peace we can<br/>
Though tribulation's bound to come<br/>
It's all part of His plan<br/>
Oh and<br/>

All glory to God in the sky,<br/>
And peace upon earth be restored!<br/>
O Jesus, exalted on high,<br/>
Appear our omnipotent Lord:<br/>
Who meanly in Bethlehem born,<br/>
Didst stoop to redeem a lost race,<br/>
Once more to Thy creature return,<br/>
And reign in Thy kingdom of grace.<br/>

When Thou in our flesh didst appear,<br/>
All nature acknowledged Thy birth;<br/>
Arose the acceptable year,<br/>

The Giver of concord and love,<br/>
The Prince and the Author of peace.<br/>

Again in Thy Spirit descend,<br/>
And set up in each of Thine own<br/>
A kingdom that never shall end!<br/>

And make the glad nations obey,<br/>
And bid the dire enmity cease,<br/>
And bow the whole world to Thy sway.<br/>

Come then to Thy servants again,<br/>
Who long Thy appearing to know,<br/>
Thy quiet and peaceable reign,<br/>
In mercy establish below:<br/>
All sorrow before Thee shall fly,<br/>
And anger and hatred be o’er,<br/>
And envy and malice shall die,<br/>
And discord afflict us no more.<br/>

No horrid alarm of war<br/>
Shall break our eternal repose;<br/>
No sound of the trumpet is there,<br/>
Where Jesus’ Spirit o’erflows:<br/>
Appeased by the charms of Thy grace<br/>
We all shall in amity join,<br/>
And kindly each other embrace,<br/>
And love with a passion like Thine.<br/>

Chorus: <br/>
<br/>
All God's creatures got a place in the choir <br/>
Some sing low and some sing higher <br/>
Some sing out loud on the telephone wire <br/>
Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now... <br/>
Listen to the bass; he's the one on the bottom <br/>
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus <br/>
Moans and groans with a big to do <br/>
And the old cow just goes moo. <br/>
<br/>
Dogs and cats they take up the middle <br/>
Where the honey bee hums and the cricket fiddles <br/>
Where the donkey brays and the pony neighs <br/>
And the old grey badger sighs. <br/>
<br/>
Listen to the ducks and the little birds singing <br/>
On the melody with the high notes ringing <br/>
The hoot owl cries over everything <br/>
And the jay bird disagrees. <br/>
<br/>
Singing in the night-time, singing in the day <br/>
The little duck quacks and he's on his way <br/>
The otter hasn't got that much to say <br/>
And the porcupine talks to himself. <br/>
<br/>
It's a simple song, a living song everywhere <br/>
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear <br/>
The grumpy alligator and the hawk above <br/>
The sly old weasel and the turtle dove. <br/>

Who once was slain to reconcile man to God<br/>
<br/>
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the Throne<br/>
<br/>
I gladly bow my knee and worship You alone<br/>

Lord I'm tired, so tired from walking<br/>
And Lord, I'm so alone<br/>
And Lord, the dark is creeping in, creeping up to swallow me<br/>
I think I'll stop, rest here awhile.<br/>
<br/>
This is all that I can say right now and (I know it's not much)<br/>
This is all that I can give. (repeat)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And didn't you see me crying?<br/>
And didn't You hear me call Your name?<br/>
Wasn't it You I gave my heart to?<br/>
I wish You'd remember where You sat it down,<br/>
<br/>
I didn't notice You were standing here,<br/>
I didn't know that that was You holding me.<br/>
I didn't notice You were crying too,<br/>
I didn't know that that was You washing my feet,<br/>

VERSE 1:<br/>
I don't know why, I can't see how<br/>
Your precious blood could cleanse me now<br/>
When all this time, I've lived a lie,<br/>
with no excuse, no alibi<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS:<br/>
All I know is I find mercy,<br/>
All my shame You take from me<br/>
All I know Your cross has power, <br/>
and the blood You shed cleanses me<br/>
<br/>
VERSE 2:<br/>
It's way beyond what I can see,<br/>
how anyone could die for me<br/>
So undeserved, this precious grace,<br/>
You've won my heart, I'll see your face<br/>

All I Want<br/>
Words and Music by Andy Park<br/>
<br/>
In the morning when I rise<br/>
Expectantly I lift my eyes<br/>
And I see You (echo)<br/>
Gazing on Your heavenly throne<br/>
In Your presence I'm at home<br/>
Here with You (echo)<br/>
<br/>
All I want is more<br/>
And more of You<br/>
<br/>
Earthly cares and passions pale<br/>
When You tke away the veil<br/>
And I see You (echo)<br/>
When You open heaven's door<br/>
All I want to have is more<br/>
More of You (echo)<br/>
<br/>
And all I want<br/>
Is more and more of You<br/>
<br/>
The earth and all its glory will fade<br/>
But the word of our God will stand<br/>
The earth and all its glory will fade<br/>
But the kingdom of God I will see<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in the world compares<br/>
To the love that I can share<br/>
Alone with You (echo)<br/>
There is nothing else so real<br/>
As the things as You reveal<br/>
When I'm with You (echo)<br/>

Take my hand, lead me, Lord<br/>
Take me to your door<br/>
Cover me with your blood<br/>
That's all I'm asking for, that's all I'm asking for<br/>
<br/>
Every day and every night it feel the same<br/>
When I come to the end of the road<br/>
But you Spirit give me power when I call on your name<br/>
The wonderful name of the Lord<br/>
<br/>
It's a rush and it's a high that won't ever leave<br/>
When I look into the eyes of the one<br/>
Who can heal me, who can free me to fly again<br/>
Straight to the arms of the son<br/>
<br/>
That's all I'm asking for<br/>
You go through all the broken places<br/>
Giving me the hope to try again<br/>

Lord to give up, I'd be a fool<br/>

Jesus Lamb of God, worthy is Your name<br/>
Taking my sin my cross, my shame<br/>

Rising again, I bless Your name<br/>

Numberless angels bright<br/>

Beautiful songs they sang,<br/>
Wonderful echoes rang;<br/>

Glory to God on high.<br/>

Nor let the heart withhold<br/>
Aught of its purest gold;<br/>
All to the King resign.<br/>

Broken the shades of night;<br/>

All is o’er, the pain, the sorrow,<br/>
Human taunts and fiendish spite;<br/>
Death shall be despoiled tomorrow<br/>
Of the prey he grasps tonight;<br/>
Yet awhile, His own to save,<br/>
Christ must linger in the grave.
<br/>
<br/>
Dark and still the cell that holds Him,<br/>
While in brief repose He lies;<br/>
Deep the slumber that enfolds Him,<br/>
Veiled awhile from mortal eyes;<br/>
Slumber such as needs must be<br/>
After hard won victory.<br/>
<br/>
Fierce and deadly was the anguish<br/>
Which on yonder cross He bore;<br/>
How did soul and body languish<br/>
Till the toil of death was o’er:<br/>
But that toil, so fierce and dread,<br/>
Bruised and crushed the serpent’s head.<br/>
<br/>
All night long, with plaintive voicing,<br/>
Chant His requiem soft and low:<br/>
Loftier strains of loud rejoicing<br/>
From tomorrow’s harps shall flow:<br/>
“Death and hell at length are slain!<br/>
Christ hath triumphed! Christ doth reign!"<br/>

Chorus 1:<br/>
Sitting in my boat fishing in the sea<br/>
Putting out my net and oh so carefully<br/>
When it comes back, well what will it be?<br/>
All kinds of fishes when you're fishing in the sea <br/>
All kinds of fishes when you're fishing in the sea <br/>
<br/>
Big school of dolphins splashing in the sun<br/>
They don't care much, they're just having fun<br/>
Over to the left a jellyfish in tow<br/>
Following the current wherever it may go <br/>
<br/>
Catfish make you wait all day<br/>
Then he grabs the bait and tries to run away<br/>
Bringing in starfish really is a cinch<br/>
'Cause he sits on the bottom <br/>
And doesn't move an inch <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus 1 <br/>
<br/>
Chorus 2:<br/>
Fisherman, I wanna be God's fisherman<br/>
If it weren't for all of those scales and fins<br/>
I'd say fish were just like men<br/>
Fisherman, I wanna be God's fisherman<br/>
Well the Lord told me to cast my net<br/>
Though I'm not finished yet<br/>
I am a fisherman! <br/>
<br/>
If you're dealing with a shark, never pick a fight<br/>
They've got a big mouth eating everything in sight<br/>
A whale snacked Jonah, we know this is true<br/>
He may be a giant but his heart is big too <br/>
<br/>
Crab is one nut that's tough to crack<br/>
With great big claws and thick-skinned back<br/>
Swordfish got a great big snout<br/>
But they never give up and they never give out <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus 2 <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus 1 (x2) <br/>
<br/>
All kinds of fishes when you're fishing in the sea <br/>

I am a fisherman! <br/>

All labor gained new dignity<br/>
since he who all creation made<br/>
toiled with his hands for daily bread<br/>
right manfully.<br/>
<br/>
No work is commonplace, if all<br/>
be done as unto him alone;<br/>
life's simplest toil to him is known<br/>
who knoweth all.<br/>
<br/>
Each smallest common thing he makes<br/>
serves him with its minutest part;<br/>
man only with his wand'ring heart<br/>
his way forsakes.<br/>
<br/>
His service is life's highest joy,<br/>
it yields fair fruit a hundred fold:<br/>
be this our prayer--"Not fame, nor gold,<br/>
but--thine employ!"<br/>

All lands, to God in joyful sounds<br/>
Aloft your voices raise;<br/>
Sing forth the honor of His Name,<br/>
And glorious make His praise,<br/>
And glorious make His praise.<br/>
<br/>
Say ye to God, how terrible<br/>
In all Thy works art Thou!<br/>
To Thee Thy foes by Thy great power<br/>
Shall be constrained to bow,<br/>
Shall be constrained to bow.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, all the earth shall worship Thee,<br/>
And unto Thee shall sing;<br/>
To Thy great Name shall songs of joy<br/>
With loud hosannas ring,<br/>
With loud hosannas ring.<br/>
<br/>
O come, behold the works of God,<br/>
His mighty doings see;<br/>
In dealing with the sons of men<br/>
Most wonderful is He,<br/>
Most wonderful is He.<br/>
<br/>
He led in safety through the flood<br/>
The people of His choice,<br/>
He turned the sea to solid ground;<br/>
In Him let us rejoice,<br/>
In Him let us rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
He rules forever by His might,<br/>
His eyes the nations try;<br/>
Let not the proud, rebellious ones<br/>
Exalt themselves on high,<br/>
Exalt themselves on high.<br/>

All mankind fell in Adam’s fall,<br/>
One common sin infects us all;<br/>
From sire to son the bane descends,<br/>
And over all the curse impends.<br/>
<br/>
Thro’ all man’s powers corruption creeps<br/>
And him in dreadful bondage keeps;<br/>
In guilt he draws his infant breath<br/>
And reaps its fruits of woe and death.<br/>
<br/>
From hearts depraved, to evil prone,<br/>
Flow thoughts and deeds of sin alone;<br/>
God’s image lost, the darkened soul<br/>
Nor seeks nor finds its heav’nly goal.<br/>
<br/>
But Christ, the second Adam, came<br/>
To bear our sin and woe and shame,<br/>
To be our Life, our Light, our Way,<br/>
Our only Hope, our only Stay.<br/>
<br/>
As by one man all mankind fell<br/>
And, born in sin, was doomed to hell,<br/>
So by one Man, Who took our place,<br/>
We all received the gift of grace.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee, Christ; new life is ours,<br/>
New light, new hope, new strength, new powers:<br/>
This grace our every way attend<br/>
Until we reach our journey’s end!<br/>

All men living are but mortal,<br/>
Yea, all flesh must fade as grass;<br/>
Only through death’s gloomy portal<br/>
To eternal life we pass.<br/>
This frail body here must perish<br/>
Ere the heav’nly love joys it cherish,<br/>
Ere it gain the free reward<br/>
For the ransomed of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, when my God doth choose it,<br/>
Willingly I’ll yield my life<br/>
Nor will grieve that I should lose it,<br/>
For with sorrows it was rife.<br/>
In my dear Redeemer’s merit<br/>
Peace hath found my troubled spirit,<br/>
And in death my comfort this:<br/>
Jesus’ death my source of bliss.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus for my sake descended<br/>
My salvation to obtain;<br/>
Death and hell for me are ended,<br/>
Peace and hope are now my gain;<br/>
Yea, with joy I leave earth’s sadness<br/>
For the home of heav’nly gladness,<br/>
Where I shall forever see<br/>
God, the Holy Trinity.<br/>
<br/>
There is joy beyond our telling,<br/>
Where so many saints have gone;<br/>
Thousands, thousands, there are dwelling,<br/>
Worshiping before the throne,<br/>
There the seraphim are shining,<br/>
Evermore in chorus joining:<br/>
“Holy, holy, holy Lord!<br/>
Triune God, for aye adored!"<br/>
<br/>
Patriarchs of sacred story<br/>
And the prophets there are found;<br/>
The apostles, too, in glory<br/>
On twelve seats are there enthroned,<br/>
All the saints that have ascended<br/>
Age on age, through time extended,<br/>
There in blissful concert sing<br/>
Hallelujahs to their King.<br/>
<br/>
O Jerusalem, how glorious<br/>
Dost thou shine, thou city fair!<br/>
Lo, I hear the tone victorious<br/>
Ever sweetly sounding there.<br/>
Oh, the bliss that there surprises!<br/>
Lo, the sun of morn now rises,<br/>
And the breaking day I see<br/>
That shall never end for me.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, I see what here was told me,<br/>
See that wondrous glory shine,<br/>
Feel the spotless robes enfold me,<br/>
Know a golden crown is mine,<br/>
Thus before the throne so glorious<br/>
Now I stand a soul victorious,<br/>
Gazing on that joy for aye<br/>
That shall never pass away.<br/>

All mortal vanities, begone,<br/>
Nor tempt my eyes, nor tire my ears;<br/>
Behold, amidst th’eternal throne,<br/>
A vision of the Lamb appears.<br/>
<br/>
Glory His fleecy robe adorns,<br/>
Marked with the bloody death He bore;<br/>
Seven are His eyes, and seven His horns,<br/>
To speak His wisdom and His power.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! He receives a sealèd book<br/>
From Him that sits upon the throne;<br/>
Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look<br/>
On dark decrees and things unknown.<br/>
<br/>
All the assembling saints around<br/>
Fall worshipping before the Lamb,<br/>
And in new songs of Gospel sound<br/>
Address their honors to His Name.<br/>
<br/>
The joy, the shout, the harmony,<br/>
Flies o’er the everlasting hills<br/>
“Worthy art Thou alone," they cry,<br/>
“To read the book, to loose the seals."<br/>
<br/>
Our voices join the heav’nly strain,<br/>
And with transporting pleasure sing,<br/>
“Worthy the Lamb that once was slain,<br/>
To be our Teacher and our King!"<br/>
<br/>
His words of prophecy reveal<br/>
Eternal counsels, deep designs;<br/>
His grace and vengeance shall fulfill<br/>
The peaceful and the dreadful lines.<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast redeemed our souls from hell<br/>
With Thine invaluable blood;<br/>
And wretches that did once rebel<br/>
Are now made favorites of their God.<br/>
<br/>
Worthy forever is the Lord,<br/>
That died for treasons not His own,<br/>
By every tongue to be adored,<br/>
And dwell upon His Father’s throne!<br/>

All my heart this night rejoices,<br/>
As I hear, far and near, sweetest angel voices;<br/>
“Christ is born," their choirs are singing,<br/>
Till the air, everywhere, now their joy is ringing.<br/>
<br/>
For it dawns, the promised morrow<br/>
Of His birth, Who the earth rescues from her sorrow.<br/>
God to wear our form descendeth;<br/>
Of His grace to our race here His Son He sendeth.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, so truly for us careth,<br/>
That His Son, all we've done, as our offering beareth;<br/>
As our Lamb Who, dying for us,<br/>
Bears our load, and to God, doeth in peace restore us.<br/>
<br/>
Hark! a voice from yonder manger,<br/>
Soft and sweet, doth entreat, “Flee from woe and danger;<br/>
Brethren, come; from all that grieves you<br/>
You are freed; all you need I will surely give you."<br/>
<br/>
Come, then, let us hasten yonder;<br/>
Here let all, great and small, kneel in awe and wonder,<br/>
Love Him Who with love is yearning;<br/>
Hail the star that from far bright with hope is burning.<br/>
<br/>
Ye who pine in weary sadness,<br/>
Weep no more, for the door now is found of gladness.<br/>
Cling to Him, for He will guide you<br/>
Where no cross, pain or loss, can again betide you.<br/>
<br/>
Hither come, ye poor and wretched:<br/>
Know His will is to fill every hand outstretchèd;<br/>
Here are riches without measure,<br/>
Here forget all regret, fill your hearts with treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd Savior, let me find Thee!<br/>
Keep Thou me close to Thee, cast me not behind Thee!<br/>
Life of life, my heart Thou stillest,<br/>
Calm I rest on Thy breast, all this void Thou fillest.<br/>
<br/>
Thee, dear Lord, with heed I’ll cherish;<br/>
Live to Thee and with Thee, dying, shall not perish;<br/>
But shall dwell with Thee for ever,<br/>
Far on high, in the joy that can alter never. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Forth today the Conqueror goeth,<br/>
Who the foe, sin and woe, death and hell, o’erthroweth.<br/>
God is man, man to deliver;<br/>
His dear Son now is one with our blood forever.<br/>
<br/>
Shall we still dread God’s displeasure,<br/>
Who, to save, freely gave His most cherished Treasure?<br/>
To redeem us, He hath given<br/>
His own Son from the throne of His might in Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Should He who Himself imparted<br/>
Aught withhold from the fold, leave us broken hearted?<br/>
Should the Son of God not love us,<br/>
Who, to cheer sufferers here, left His throne above us?<br/>
<br/>
If our blessèd Lord and Maker<br/>
Hated men, would He then be of flesh partaker?<br/>
If He in our woe delighted,<br/>
Would He bear all the care of our race benighted?<br/>
<br/>
He becomes the Lamb that taketh<br/>
Sin away and for aye full atonement maketh.<br/>
For our life His own He tenders<br/>
And our race, by His grace, meet for glory renders.<br/>

To this lower world descendeth,<br/>
From above, He whose love<br/>
All our sorrows endeth.<br/>
He who breath and being gave us,<br/>
Quits the skies, lives and dies<br/>
In our flesh to save us.<br/>
<br/>
Christ our Lamb so meek and loving<br/>
Dries our tears, calms our fears,<br/>
All our sins removing;<br/>
Christ our Lamb, who suffers with us;<br/>
He can quell death and hell,<br/>
And to peace restore us.<br/>
<br/>
Hark, from yon dark manger lowly,<br/>
Breezes soft seem to waft<br/>
Gentle words and holy:<br/>
“Sigh no more, away with sadness<br/>
Brethren dear; I am here,<br/>
Bringing hope and gladness."<br/>
<br/>
Come ye now, and kneel before Him;<br/>
Mortals all, great and small,<br/>
Worship and adore Him:<br/>
Love your King, whose love invites you:<br/>
Lo, His star from afar<br/>
To His dwelling lights you.<br/>
<br/>
Ye, whom galling want oppresses<br/>
Here ye find comfort kind,<br/>
Balm for your distresses:<br/>
Noblest treasures here are given;<br/>
Riches true wait for you<br/>
Poor of Christ, in Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Ye who strive with fierce temptation,<br/>
Sorrow-stung, conscience-wrung,<br/>
Here is consolation:<br/>
For the woes which men inherit<br/>
Christ can feel, Christ will heal<br/>
Every wounded spirit. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kind Redeemer, knit Thee to us;<br/>
Quelling sin, reign within,<br/>
With Thy grace renew us:<br/>
Make us Thine by true repentance;<br/>
Let us hear, free from fear,<br/>
Lord, Thy final sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Ours be Thy pure love, O Savior,<br/>
Ours Thy faith, strong in death,<br/>
Ours Thy meek behavior;<br/>
Here let us, on Thee depending,<br/>
In Thee die, with Thee fly<br/>
To the bliss unending.<br/>

All my hope on God is founded;<br/>
He doth still my trust renew,<br/>
Me through change and chance He guideth,<br/>
Only good and only true.<br/>
God unknown, He alone<br/>
Calls my heart to be His own.<br/>
<br/>
Pride of man and earthly glory,<br/>
Sword and crown betray His trust;<br/>
What with care and toil He buildeth,<br/>
Tower and temple fall to dust.<br/>
But God’s power, hour by hour,<br/>
Is my temple and my tower.<br/>
<br/>
God’s great goodness aye endureth,<br/>
Deep His wisdom, passing thought:<br/>
Splendor, light and life attend him,<br/>
Beauty springeth out of naught.<br/>
Evermore from His store<br/>
Newborn worlds rise and adore.<br/>
<br/>
Daily doth th’almighty Giver<br/>
Bounteous gifts on us bestow;<br/>
His desire our soul delighteth,<br/>
Pleasure leads us where we go.<br/>
Love doth stand at His hand;<br/>
Joy doth wait on His command.<br/>
<br/>
Still from man to God eternal<br/>
Sacrifice of praise be done,<br/>
High above all praises praising<br/>
For the gift of Christ, His Son.<br/>
Christ doth call one and all:<br/>
Ye who follow shall not fall.<br/>

All my life I had a longing<br/>
For a drink from some clear spring,<br/>
That I hoped would quench the burning<br/>
Of the thirst I felt within.<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah! I have found Him<br/>
Whom my soul so long has craved!<br/>
Jesus satisfies my longings,<br/>
Through His blood I now am saved.<br/>
<br/>
Feeding on the husks around me,<br/>
Till my strength was almost gone,<br/>
Longed my soul for something better,<br/>
Only still to hunger on.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Poor I was, and sought for riches,<br/>
Something that would satisfy,<br/>
But the dust I gathered round me<br/>
Only mocked my soul’s sad cry.<br/>

Refrain<br/>

Well of water, ever springing,<br/>
Bread of life so rich and free,<br/>
Untold wealth that never faileth,<br/>
My Redeemer is to me.<br/>

When I go don't cry for me<br/>
In my fathers arms I'll be<br/>
The wounds this world left on my soul<br/>
Will all be healed and I'll be whole<br/>
Sun and moon will be replaced<br/>
With the light of Jesus' face<br/>
And I will not be ashamed<br/>
For my savior knows my name<br/>
It don't matter where you bury me<br/>
I'll be home and I'll be free<br/>
It don't matter where I lay<br/>
All my tears be washed away<br/>
Gold and silver blind the eye<br/>
Temporary riches lie<br/>
Come and eat from heaven's store<br/>
Come and drink and thirst no more<br/>
So weep not for me my friend<br/>
When my time below does end<br/>
For my life belongs to him<br/>
Who will raise the dead again<br/>
It don't matter where you bury me<br/>
I'll be home and I'll be free<br/>
It don't matter where I lay<br/>
All my tears be washed away<br/>

That money could buy,<br/>

A strong, embracing force;<br/>
The drops that sparkle in the shower,<br/>
The planets in their course.<br/>

In this fine, sympathetic chain<br/>
All creatures bear a part;<br/>
Their every pleasure, every pain,<br/>
Linked to a feeling heart.<br/>
<br/>
More perfect bond, the Christian plan<br/>
Attaches soul to soul;<br/>
Our neighbor is the suffering man<br/>
Thou at the farthest pole.<br/>

To earth below, from Heaven above,<br/>

And whom He loves is blest.<br/>

All nature’s works His praise declare, to Whom they all belong;<br/>
There is a voice in every star, in every breeze a song.<br/>
Sweet music fills the world abroad with strains of love and power;<br/>
The stormy sea sings praise to God, the thunder and the shower.<br/>
<br/>
To God the tribes of ocean cry, and birds upon the wing;<br/>
To God the powers that dwell on high their tuneful tribute bring.<br/>
Like them, let us the throne surround, with them loud chorus raise,<br/>
While instruments of loftier sound assist our feeble praise.<br/>
<br/>
Great God, to Thee we consecrate our voices and our skill;<br/>
We bid the pealing organ wait to speak alone Thy will.<br/>
Lord, while the music round us floats may earth born passions die;<br/>
O grant its rich and swelling notes may lift our souls on high!<br/>

All praise be to God, whom all things obey,<br/>
From angels and men for ever and aye:<br/>
Who sendeth on earth the powers of His throne,<br/>
His providence good and love to make known.<br/>
<br/>
His angels are they of countenance fair,<br/>
The arm of His strength, His hand of kind care:<br/>
His message of peace to us they reveal,<br/>
His wisdom most high they seal or unseal.<br/>
<br/>
By martyrs of old they stood in the flame,<br/>
And bade them not flinch, but call on God’s Name.<br/>
Thro’ torment, thro’ shame, thro’ darkness of death<br/>
They led without fear the sires of our faith.<br/>
<br/>
They stand with the few, they fight for the free,<br/>
God’s reign to advance o’er land and o’er sea:<br/>
And when the brave die or fall in the fight,<br/>
Their spirits they bear to rest in God’s sight.<br/>
<br/>
For patience and toil a crown they prepare;<br/>
They found for the meek a kingdom full fair;<br/>
No famine nor plague ’gainst them doth prevail;<br/>
Their bread cannot lack, their cruse cannot fail.<br/>

We pray Thee, Who art Thy angels’ reward,<br/>
Thy flock to defend forget not, O Lord;<br/>
But prosper their aid, that us they may bring<br/>
To see the true face of Jesus, our King.<br/>

For us sinners; He came and died. <br/>

Protecting us from evil things. <br/>

Sleep that may me more vigorous make<br/>

All praise to Saint Patrick,<br/>
who brought to our mountains<br/>
The gift of God's faith,<br/>
the sweet light of His love.<br/>
All praise to the Shepherd<br/>
who showed us the fountains<br/>
That rise in the Heart<br/>
of the Saviour above.<br/>
For hundreds of years,<br/>
In smiles and in tears,<br/>
Our Saint hath been with us,<br/>
our shield and our stay;<br/>
All else may have gone,<br/>
Saint Patrick alone.<br/>
He hath been to us light,<br/>
when earth's lights were all set,<br/>
For the glories of faith<br/>
they can never decay,<br/>
And the best of our glories<br/>
is bright with us yet,<br/>
in the faith and the feast<br/>
of Saint Patrick's day.<br/>
There is not a Saint<br/>
in the bright courts of heaven,<br/>
More faithful than he<br/>
to the land of his choice;<br/>
Oh well may the nation<br/>
to whom he was given,<br/>
In the feast of their Sire<br/>
and apostle rejoice.<br/>
In Glory above<br/>
True to his love,<br/>
He keeps the false faith<br/>
from his children away.<br/>
The dark false faith<br/>
Far worse than death.<br/>
Oh he drives it far off<br/>
from the green sunny shore,<br/>
Like the reptiles that fled<br/>
from his curse in dismay,<br/>
And Erin when error's<br/>
proud triumph is o'er,<br/>
Will still be found keeping<br/>
Saint Patrick's day.<br/>
<br/>
Then what shall we do<br/>
for the heaven sent father?<br/>
What shall the proof<br/>
of our loyalty be?<br/>
By all that is dear<br/>
to our hearts we would rather<br/>
Be martyred sweet Saint,<br/>
than bring shame upon thee.<br/>
But oh, he will take<br/>
The promise we make,<br/>
So to live that our lives<br/>
by God's help, may display<br/>
The light that he bore<br/>
To Erin's shore.<br/>
Oh Yes Father of Ireland!<br/>
no child wilt thou own<br/>
Whose life is not lighted<br/>
by grace on its way;<br/>
For they are true Irish,<br/>
ah yes, they alone,<br/>
Whose hearts are all true<br/>
on Saint Patrick's day.<br/>

There was a holy hush all over<br/>
As I walked into the room<br/>
And as I stood to see Him face to face<br/>
I was gloriously made new<br/>
There was a great and awesome presence<br/>

And as I bowed to kneel with the angels<br/>
I hear the Spirit say (oh, heard it say)<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
All rise (all rise), all rise (all rise)<br/>
To stand before the throne<br/>
In the presence of the Holy One<br/>
All rise (all rise), all rise (all rise)<br/>

All rise<br/>

Then I looked at those all around me<br/>
With their hands uplifted high<br/>
And the Spirit laid His hands on me<br/>
And I uplifted mine (alleluia)<br/>
And He was singing alleluias<br/>
And praises to His name (praise Your Holy name)<br/>
And as I bowed to kneel with the angels<br/>
I heard the Spirit say (heard it say)<br/>

Repeat Chorus<br/>

Singing holy, holy, holy (holy, holy)<br/>
Worthy is the Lamb (worthy)<br/>

And bring down the rain,<br/>
I know that You will sustain me Lord.<br/>

Your love is all that I need,<br/>
All that I need, all that I need.<br/>
Your love is all that I need,<br/>
All that I need is You.<br/>

Jesus You know what's inside of my heart,<br/>
When I am coming apart at the seams.<br/>
But that's when my true colours<br/>
Come shining through,<br/>
I know that You are the One for me.<br/>

All that I was, my sin, my guilt,<br/>
My death, was all mine own;<br/>
All that I am I owe to Thee,<br/>
My gracious God, alone.<br/>
<br/>
The evil of my former state<br/>
Was mine, and only mine;<br/>
The good in which I now rejoice<br/>
Is Thine, and only Thine.<br/>
<br/>
The darkness of my former state,<br/>
The bondage, all was mine;<br/>
The light of life in which I walk,<br/>
The liberty, is Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Thy Word first made me feel my sin,<br/>
It taught me to believe;<br/>
Then, in believing, peace I found,<br/>
And now I live, I live!<br/>
<br/>
All that I am, e’en here on earth<br/>
All that I hope to be,<br/>
When Jesus comes and glory dawns,<br/>
I owe it, Lord to Thee.<br/>

All that our Savior hath spoken<br/>
Came from the heart of God;<br/>
Surely it cannot be broken,<br/>
Sealed with His precious blood.<br/>

Tempests may rage and thunder,<br/>

Wait a few hours, and in splendor<br/>
Morning again will dawn!<br/>

Trust! tho’ all others forsake thee,<br/>
Yet there remains one Friend;<br/>
Mercy and truth shall o’ertake thee<br/>

Who can cheer the heart like Jesus<br/>
By His presence all divine<br/>
True and tender, pure and precious<br/>
O, how blest to call Him mine<br/>
<br/>
Chorus<br/>
All that thrills my soul is Jesus<br/>
He is more than life to me<br/>
And the fairest of ten thousand<br/>
In my blessed Lord I see<br/>
<br/>
Love of Christ so freely given<br/>
Grace of God beyond degree<br/>
Mercy higher than the heavens<br/>
Deeper than the deepest sea<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful redemption<br/>
Never can a mortal know<br/>
Ho my sin, though red like crimson<br/>
Can be whiter than the snow<br/>
<br/>
Every need His hand supplying<br/>
Every good in Him I see<br/>
On His strength divine relying<br/>
He is all in all to me<br/>

With the ransomed I will sing<br/>
And forever and forever<br/>
Praise and glorify the King<br/>

Mercies dawn with every day,<br/>
Newer, brighter than before;<br/>
And the sun’s declining ray<br/>
Layeth others up in store.<br/>

Not a bird that doth not sing<br/>
Sweetest praises to Thy Name;<br/>
Not an insect on the wing<br/>
But Thy wonders doth proclaim.<br/>
<br/>
Every blade and every tree<br/>
All in happy concert ring,<br/>
And in wondrous harmony<br/>
Join in praises to their King.<br/>
<br/>
Fill us, then, with love divine;<br/>
Grant that we, though toiling here,<br/>
May in spirit, being Thine,<br/>
See and hear Thee everywhere.<br/>

Whilst on earth Thy Name adore,<br/>
Till with angel choirs we raise<br/>
Songs of praise forevermore.<br/>

A passion from within <br/>
My hands I raise <br/>
My God I praise <br/>
For I am precious to my Savior <br/>

Has filled me up <br/>

My God can never fail,<br/>

He's never early, never late<br/>
It takes courage, it takes faith<br/>
Trust Him and see<br/>
He's got all the power you need<br/>

He saves, forgives, and heals<br/>
Takes back what the devil steals<br/>
My debt's been paid in full<br/>
And every day He does miracles<br/>
<br/>
I got dreams, turn them into plans<br/>
Too big for human hands<br/>
Trust Him and see<br/>
He's got all the power you need<br/>

Faith's a lot stronger than what you feel<br/>
He's real, He's real<br/>

All the sacrifice is ended,<br/>
Breathed His body’s latest breath,<br/>
And His human Soul hath wended<br/>
Where the weary rest beneath;<br/>
Christ as Man hath comprehended<br/>
All the human law of death!<br/>
<br/>
Yet not there His Soul remaineth<br/>
Nor His body in the tomb:<br/>
Lo! what sudden glory gaineth<br/>
Quick dominion o’er the gloom!<br/>
Yea, o’er death and hell He reigneth<br/>
Bursting back the gates of doom!<br/>
<br/>
Manifold the attestation<br/>
Brethren tell the marvel o’er,<br/>
And the soldiers from their station,<br/>
And the angels at the door,<br/>
And His own Word’s revelation,<br/>
“Lo! I live for evermore."<br/>
<br/>
Hail, thou morn of resurrection,<br/>
Primal holy Easter Day!<br/>
Now the hours of deep dejection<br/>
’Neath the night-clouds’ dark array,<br/>
Foes’ reviling, friends’ defection,<br/>
In thy glory pass away!<br/>
<br/>
Now He lives and reigns for ever!<br/>
That we too may enter in<br/>
Where eternal life shall never<br/>
Taste of sorrow or of sin,<br/>
Where from Him no death shall sever<br/>
Those He vanquished death to win.<br/>
<br/>
Savior! in our night of weeping<br/>
Tell us of the joyful morn,<br/>
Guard our souls, their vigil keeping<br/>
In the hours of hate and scorn<br/>
Raise us falling, wake us sleeping,<br/>
Till our Easter Day be born.<br/>

Within my heart was fond ambition,<br/>
Vain pride, and hopes of worldly fame;<br/>
But still remained a place so vacant,<br/>
Unfilled by highest earthly aim.<br/>
Then Jesus reached His hand to help me—<br/>
“Come, seek My love," I heard Him say;<br/>
I quickly left the world behind me,<br/>
To follow Jesus all the way. <br/>
<br/>
He led me through the verdant valleys,<br/>
Where flowers bloomed by waters fair;<br/>
The sunbeams glory showered o’er me,<br/>
And fragrant odors filled the air.<br/>
Then through the shadowed vale I followed,<br/>
Where entered not a brilliant ray;<br/>
I felt His touch, though could not see Him,<br/>
Then whispered softly, “All the way." <br/>
<br/>
And then the furnace door was opened:<br/>
Within its fiery walls enclosed,<br/>
The Son of God was still beside me,<br/>
Upon His bosom I reposed.<br/>
When in my heart He saw reflected<br/>
His image pure—as bright as day—<br/>
He led me forth with joy abounding;<br/>
Again I whispered, “All the way." <br/>
<br/>
I stood all ready for His service,<br/>
With gold refined and dross removed;<br/>
The flames had left my soul uninjured,<br/>
But they my faithfulness had proved.<br/>
In dismal night or brightest noonday,<br/>
If Thou wilt near me ever stay,<br/>
Where’er Thou leadest me, O Savior,<br/>
I’ll meekly follow all the way. <br/>

This my song through endless ages—<br/>
Jesus led me all the way.<br/>

All those that pass by, to Jesus draw near,<br/>
He utters a cry, ye sinners, give ear!<br/>
From hell to retrieve you He spreads out His hands;<br/>
And now to receive you, He graciously stands.<br/>
<br/>
If any man thirst, and happy would be,<br/>
The vilest and worst may come unto Me,<br/>
May drink of My Spirit, excepted is none,<br/>
Lay claim to My merit, and take for his own.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever receives the life giving Word,<br/>
In Jesus believes, his God and his Lord,<br/>
In him a pure river of life shall arise,<br/>
Shall in the believer spring up to the skies.<br/>
<br/>
My God and my Lord! Thy call I obey,<br/>
My soul on Thy word of promise I stay,<br/>
Thy kind invitation I gladly embrace,<br/>
Athirst for salvation, salvation by grace.<br/>
<br/>
O hasten the hour! Send down from above<br/>
The Spirit of power, of health, and of love,<br/>
Of filial fear, of knowledge and grace,<br/>
Of wisdom and prayer, of joy and of praise.<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit of faith, of faith in Thy blood,<br/>
Which saves us from wrath, and brings us to God,<br/>
Removes the huge mountain of indwelling sin,<br/>
And opens a fountain that washes us clean.<br/>

Master designer, framer of the world<br/>

Lord of creation, high above the earth<br/>
With a word you spoke it, and all things came to be<br/>
Maker of the heavens, you’re all to me<br/>
<br/>
All to me, all to me<br/>
You made it all<br/>
Be all to me<br/>
The earth declares your majesty<br/>
Jesus be my all in all<br/>
<br/>
You walked on water, raised the dead to life<br/>
Taught us the Father, and proved you were the Light<br/>
Then you gave us something, no one else could give<br/>
Lamb of God: you suffered – so we could live<br/>
<br/>
All to me, all to me<br/>
You gave your all<br/>
Be all to me<br/>
You bled and died on Calvary<br/>
Jesus be my all in all<br/>
Jesus be my all in all<br/>

All who love and serve your city,<br/>
all who bear its daily stress,<br/>

In your day of loss and sorrow,<br/>

In your day of wrath and plenty,<br/>

"I must work while it is day."<br/>

For all days are days of judgment,<br/>
and the Lord is waiting still,<br/>
drawing near a world that spurns him,<br/>
offering peace from Calvary's hill.<br/>

All wise, all good, almighty Lord,<br/>
Jesus, by highest Heav’n adored,<br/>
Ere time its course began;<br/>
How did Thy glorious mercy stoop,<br/>
To take Thy fallen children up,<br/>
When Thou Thyself wert man?<br/>
<br/>
Th’eternal God from Heav’n came down;<br/>
The King of glory dropped His crown<br/>
And veiled His majesty;<br/>
Emptied of all but love He came,<br/>
Jesus, I call Thee by the Name,<br/>
The pity bore for me.<br/>
<br/>
O holy Child, still let Thy birth<br/>
Bring peace to us poor worms on earth,<br/>
And praise to God on high!<br/>
Come, Thou who didst my flesh assume;<br/>
Now to the abject sinner come,<br/>
And in a manger lie.<br/>
<br/>
Didst Thou not in person join<br/>
The natures human and divine,<br/>
That God and man might be<br/>
Henceforth inseparably one?<br/>
Haste then and make Thy nature known<br/>
Incarnated in me.<br/>
<br/>
In my weak, sinful flesh appear,<br/>
O God, be manifested here,<br/>
Peace, righteousness and joy;<br/>
Thy kingdom, Lord, set up within<br/>
My faithful heart; and all my sin,<br/>
The devil’s work, destroy.<br/>
<br/>
I long Thy coming to confess,<br/>
The mystic power of godliness,<br/>
The life divine to prove:<br/>
The fulness of Thy life to know,<br/>
Redeemed from all my sins below,<br/>
And perfected in love.<br/>
<br/>
O Christ, my Hope, make known to me<br/>
The great, the glorious mystery<br/>
The hidden life impart;<br/>
Come, Thou Desire of nations, come,<br/>
Formed in a spotless virgin’s womb,<br/>
A pure, believing heart.<br/>
<br/>
Come quickly, dearest Lord, that I<br/>
May own, though antichrist deny,<br/>
Thy incarnation’s power:<br/>
May cry, a witness to my Lord,<br/>
“Come in my flesh is Christ the Word,<br/>
And I must sin no more!"<br/>

All ye Gentile lands awake!<br/>
Thou, O Salem, rise and shine!<br/>
See the day-spring o’er you break,<br/>
Heralding a morn divine,<br/>
Telling, God hath called to mind<br/>
Those who long in darkness pined.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! the shadows flee away,<br/>
For our Light is come at length,<br/>
Brighter than all earthly day,<br/>
Source of being, life and strength!<br/>
Whoso on this Light would gaze<br/>
Must forsake all evil ways.<br/>
<br/>
Ah how blindly did we stray<br/>
Ere shone forth this glorious Sun,<br/>
Seeking each his separate way,<br/>
Leaving Heaven, unsought, unwon;<br/>
All our looks were earthward bent,<br/>
All our strength on earth was spent.<br/>
<br/>
Earthly were our thoughts and low,<br/>
In the toils of folly caught,<br/>
Tossed of Satan to and fro,<br/>
Counting goodness all for naught;<br/>
By the world and flesh deceived,<br/>
Heaven’s true joys we disbelieved.<br/>
<br/>
Then were hidden from our eyes<br/>
All the law and grace of God;<br/>
Rich and poor, the fools and wise,<br/>
Wanting light to find the road<br/>
Leading to the heavenly life,<br/>
Wandered lost in care and strife.<br/>
<br/>
But the glory of the Lord<br/>
Hath arisen on us today;<br/>
We have seen the light outpoured<br/>
That must surely drive away<br/>
All things that to night belong,<br/>
All the sad earth’s woe and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Thy arising, Lord, shall fill<br/>
All my thoughts in sorrow’s hour;<br/>
Thy arising, Lord, shall still<br/>
All my dread of death’s dark power;<br/>
Through my smiles and through my tears<br/>
Still Thy light, O Lord, appears.<br/>
<br/>
Let me, Lord in peace depart<br/>
From this evil world to Thee;<br/>
Where Thyself sole Brightness art,<br/>
Thou hast kept a place for me:<br/>
In the shining city there<br/>
Crowns of light Thy saints shall wear.<br/>

His glory tell, His praise proclaim;<br/>
Ye children of His chosen race,<br/>
Stand ye in awe before His face,<br/>
Stand ye in awe before His face.<br/>
<br/>
The suffering one He has not spurned<br/>
Who unto Him for succor turned;<br/>
From him He has not hid His face<br/>
But answered his request in grace,<br/>
But answered his request in grace.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, Thy goodness makes me raise<br/>
Amid Thy people songs of praise;<br/>
Before all them that fear Thee, now<br/>
I worship Thee and pay my vow,<br/>
I worship Thee and pay my vow.<br/>

The Jews, the people of His grace,<br/>
Shall their Redeemer sing;<br/>
And Gentile nations join the praise,<br/>
While Sion owns her King.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord takes pleasure in the just,<br/>
Whom sinners treat with scorn;<br/>
The meek that lie despised in dust<br/>
Salvation shall adorn.<br/>
<br/>
Saints should be joyful in their King,<br/>
E’en on a dying bed;<br/>
And like the souls in glory sing;<br/>
For God shall raise the dead.<br/>
<br/>
Then His high praise shall fill their tongues<br/>
Their hands shall wield the sword;<br/>
And vengeance shall attend their songs,<br/>
The vengeance of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
When Christ the judgment-seat ascends,<br/>
And bids the world appear,<br/>
Thrones are prepared for all His friends<br/>
Who humbly loved Him here.<br/>
<br/>
Then shall they rule with iron rod<br/>
Nations that dared rebel;<br/>
And join the sentence of their God<br/>
On tyrants doomed to hell.<br/>
<br/>
The royal sinners bound in chains<br/>
New triumphs shall afford:<br/>
Such honor for the saints remains:<br/>
Praise ye, and love the Lord!<br/>

All ye that pass by,<br/>
To Jesus draw nigh:<br/>
To you is it nothing that Jesus should die?<br/>
Your ransom and peace,<br/>
Your surety He is:<br/>
Come, see if there ever was sorrow like His. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For what you have done<br/>
His blood must atone:<br/>
The Father hath punished for you His dear Son.<br/>
The Lord, in the day<br/>
Of His anger, did lay<br/>
Your sins on the Lamb, and He bore them away.<br/>
<br/>
He answered for all:<br/>
O come at His call,<br/>
And low at His cross with astonishment fall!<br/>
But lift up your eyes<br/>
At Jesus’ cries:<br/>
Impassive, He suffers; immortal, He dies.<br/>
<br/>
He dies to atone<br/>
For sins not His own;<br/>
Your debt He hath paid, and your work He hath done.<br/>
Ye all may receive<br/>
The peace He did leave,<br/>
Who made intercession, “My Father, forgive!"<br/>
<br/>
For you and for me<br/>
He prayed on the tree:<br/>
The prayer is accepted, the sinner is free.<br/>
That sinner am I,<br/>
Who on Jesus rely,<br/>
And come for the pardon God cannot deny.<br/>
<br/>
My pardon I claim;<br/>
For a sinner I am,<br/>
A sinner believing in Jesus’ Name.<br/>
He purchased the grace<br/>
Which now I embrace:<br/>
O Father, Thou know’st He hath died in my place.<br/>
<br/>
His death is my plea;<br/>
My Advocate see,<br/>
And hear the blood speak that hath answered for me.<br/>
My ransom He was<br/>
When He bled on the cross;<br/>
And losing His life He hath carried my cause.<br/>

The earth has no voice and I have no choice<br/>
But to magnify God unashamed<br/>
Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day<br/>
Let the whole world sing out, let the people say<br/>
<br/>
Well time marches on, with the innocence gone,<br/>
And a darkness has covered the earth<br/>
But His Spirit dwells, He speaks, "it is well,"<br/>
And the hopeless still offered new birth<br/>
He will break the leash of death, it will have no sting<br/>
Let the prisoner go free, join the dance and sing <br/>

Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br/>
As o’er the trackless deep we roam;<br/>
Be Thou our haven always nigh,<br/>
On homeless waters Thou our home.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesu, Savior, at Whose voice<br/>
The tempest sank to perfect rest,<br/>
Bid Thou the fearful heart rejoice,<br/>
And cleanse and calm the troubled breast.<br/>
<br/>
O Holy Ghost, beneath Whose power<br/>
The ocean woke to life and light,<br/>
Command Thy blessing in this hour,<br/>
Thy fostering warmth, Thy quickening might.<br/>
<br/>
Great God of our salvation, Thee<br/>
We love, we worship, we adore;<br/>
Our Refuge on time’s changeful sea,<br/>
Our Joy on Heav’n’s eternal shore.<br/>

Almighty Father, Lord most high,<br/>
Who madest all, Who fillest all,<br/>
Thy Name we praise and magnify,<br/>
For all our needs on Thee we call.<br/>
<br/>
We offer to Thee of Thine own<br/>
Ourselves and all that we can bring,<br/>
In bread and cup before Thee shown,<br/>
Our universal offering.<br/>
<br/>
All that we have we bring to Thee,<br/>
Yet all is naught when all is done,<br/>
Save that in it Thy love can see<br/>
The sacrifice of Thy dear Son.<br/>
<br/>
By His command in bread and cup<br/>
His body and His blood we plead;<br/>
What on the cross He offered up<br/>
Is here our sacrifice indeed.<br/>
<br/>
For all Thy gifts of life and grace,<br/>
Here we Thy servants humbly pray<br/>
That Thou wouldst look upon the face<br/>
Of Thine anointed Son today.<br/>

Almighty Father of mankind,<br/>
On Thee our hopes remain;<br/>
And when the day of trouble comes<br/>
I shall not trust in vain.<br/>
In early years Thou wast my Guide,<br/>
And of my youth the Friend;<br/>
And as my days began with Thee,<br/>
With Thee my days shall end.<br/>
<br/>
I know the Power in Whom I trust,<br/>
The arm on which I lean;<br/>
He will my Savior ever be<br/>
Who has my Savior been.<br/>
<br/>
My God, Who causedst me to hope<br/>
When life began to beat,<br/>
And, when a stranger in the world,<br/>
Didst guide my wandering feet.<br/>
<br/>
Thou wilt not cast me off when age<br/>
And evil days descend;<br/>
Thou wilt not leave me in despair<br/>
To mourn my latter end.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore in life I’ll trust in Thee,<br/>
In death I will adore;<br/>
And after death will sing Thy praise<br/>
When time shall be no more.<br/>

Almighty Father, hallowed be Thy Name;<br/>

Thou madest man immortal at the first,<br/>

And when he fell from life, through sin accursed,<br/>
And lost his right to the life giving tree,<br/>
Thy love, unconquered would to him restore<br/>
His life ennobled and forevermore.<br/>

Such was Thy love, Thou didst not even spare<br/>
Thy Best-beloved, but gav’st Him for us all;<br/>
To live that human life beyond compare,<br/>
And dying, by His death retrieve our fall.<br/>
In Him Thy love unbounded we behold,<br/>
For, giving Him, Thou canst not aught withhold.<br/>
<br/>
Thou knowest what we are, how frail and blind,<br/>
Thou still rememb’rest that we are but dust:<br/>
Like as a father pitieth, Thou art kind,<br/>

There are who never yet have heard<br/>
The tidings of Thy blessèd Word,<br/>
But still in heathen darkness dwell,<br/>
Without one thought of Heav’n or hell.<br/>
<br/>
And some within Thy sacred fold<br/>
To holy things are dead and cold,<br/>
And waste the precious hours of life<br/>
In selfish ease, or toil, or strife;<br/>
<br/>
And many a quickened soul within<br/>
There lurks the secret love of sin,<br/>
A wayward will, or anxious fears,<br/>
Or lingering taint of bygone years.<br/>
<br/>
O give repentance true and deep<br/>
To all Thy lost and wandering sheep,<br/>
And kindle in their hearts the fire<br/>
Of holy love and pure desire.<br/>

May rise a sweeter song of love,<br/>

Adds triumph to our side! <br/>

The Devil shoots his fiery darts, <br/>
And hopes that we might fall. <br/>
But standing firm, we call on God, <br/>
The reigning king of all. <br/>

Upon our hearts of flesh. <br/>

I know there is a God who watches, who watches me<br/>
When I'm so alone<br/>
He promised a kingdom there to dwell forever, forever eternal<br/>
If I do His will I'll be in that number <br/>
Chorus:<br/>
Am I worthy of the blessings that (my) Christ has spread on me<br/>
In times of danger so dark I could not see<br/>
I can feel His love inside my soul<br/>
I want to know dear Lord am I worthy, worthy? <br/>
<br/>
Trials and tribulations (trials and tribulations), pain, pain and strife<br/>
They are a part (they are a part) of this life<br/>
If I follow His, His footsteps they will guide to that light<br/>
The way that is right <br/>
<br/>
Spoken:<br/>
Thank you Lord for always being there for me. Even though I did my own thing at 
times, didn't look for you first. But you've always been there, stayed around 
and watched over me. Dear Father, am I worthy? <br/>
<br/>
If I do His will I'll be in that number <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus (with stepouts) <br/>
<br/>
Keep me in your care<br/>
When I stumble I know that you'll be there<br/>
I just want to be in that number <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus (with stepouts) <br/>
<br/>
Am I worthy of the blessings that (my) Christ has spread on me<br/>
In times of danger so dark I could not see <br/>

Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound<br/>
That saved a wretch like me!<br/>
I once was lost, but now am found<br/>
Was blind, but now I see. <br/>
<br/>
'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,<br/>
And Grace my fears relieved.<br/>
How precious did that Grace appear<br/>
The hour I first believed. <br/>
<br/>
Through many dangers, toils, and snares<br/>
I have already come.<br/>
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far<br/>
And Grace will lead me home. <br/>
<br/>
The Lord has promised good to me.<br/>
His Word my hope secures.<br/>
He will my shield and portion be<br/>
As long as life endures. <br/>
<br/>
When we've been there ten thousand years<br/>
Bright shining as the sun,<br/>
We've no less days to sing God's praise<br/>
Than when we'd first begun. <br/>

God, the offended God most high,<br/>
Ambassadors to rebels sends;<br/>
His messengers His place supply,<br/>
And Jesus begs us to be friends.<br/>

Us, in the stead of Christ, they pray,<br/>
Us, in the stead of God, entreat,<br/>
To cast our arms, our sins, away,<br/>
And find forgiveness at His feet.<br/>

Our God in Christ! Thine embassy,<br/>
And proffered mercy, we embrace;<br/>

Among a thousand stars.<br/>

And in melodious accent, speaks<br/>
The goodness of Thy names.<br/>
<br/>
Thy justice, holiness, and truth,<br/>
Our solemn awe excite;<br/>
But the sweet charms of sovereign grace<br/>
O’erwhelm us with delight.<br/>
<br/>
Sinai, in clouds, and smoke, and fire,<br/>
Thunders Thy dreadful Name;<br/>
But Sion sings, in melting notes,<br/>
The honors of the Lamb.<br/>
<br/>
In all Thy doctrine and commands,<br/>
Thy counsels and designs,<br/>
In every work Thy hands have framed,<br/>
Thy love supremely shines.<br/>
<br/>
Angels and men the news proclaim,<br/>
Through earth and Heaven above,<br/>
The joyful and transporting news,<br/>
That God the Lord is love!<br/>

He has not turned from those that mourn,<br/>
He hearkens to their cries.<br/>
His goodness makes me join the throng<br/>

’Mid those who fear His Name.<br/>

When at His table sits the Lord!<br/>
The wine how rich, the bread how sweet,<br/>
When Jesus deigns the guests to meet!<br/>

If now, with eyes defiled and dim,<br/>
We see the signs, but see not Him;<br/>
O may His love the scales displace,<br/>
And bid us see Him face to face!<br/>

O lift the veil, if veil there be,<br/>
Let every saint Your glory see!<br/>

1. An Alien from God, and a Stranger to Grace<br/>
I wandered through earth its gay pleasures to trace;<br/>
In the pathway of sin I continued to roam,<br/>
Unmindful, alas! That it led me from home.<br/>
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.<br/>
O Savior, direct me to heaven my home.<br/>
<br/>
2. The pleasures of earth I have seen fade away.<br/>
They bloom for a season, but soon they decay;<br/>
But pleasures more lasting in Jesus are giv'n,<br/>
Salvation on earth and a mansion in heav'n.<br/>
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.<br/>
The saints in those mansions are ever at home.<br/>
<br/>
3. Allure me no longer, ye false glowing charms<br/>
The Savior invites me, I'll go to His arms;<br/>
At the banquet of mercy I hear there is room,<br/>
O there may I feast with His children at home.<br/>
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.<br/>
O Jesus, conduct me to heaven my home.<br/>
<br/>
4, Farewell, vain amusements, my follies adieu, <br/>
While Jesus, and heaven, and glory I view,<br/>
I feast on the pleasures that flow from His throne.<br/>
The footstool of heaven, sweet heaven, my home.<br/>
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.<br/>
O when shall I share the fruition of home.<br/>
<br/>
5. The days of my exile are passing away,<br/>
The time is approaching when Jesus will say,<br/>
"Well done, faithful servant, sit down on my throne,<br/>
And dwell in my presence forever at home.<br/>
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.<br/>
O there I shall rest with the Savior at home.<br/>
<br/>
6. Affliction and sorrow, and death shall be o'er;<br/>
The saints shall unite to be parted no more;<br/>
Their loud hallelujahs fill heaven's high dome.<br/>
They dwell with the Savior forever at home.<br/>
Home, home, sweet, sweet home.<br/>
They dwell with the Savior forever at home.<br/>

An army of youth <br/>
Flying the standards of truth, <br/>
We're fighting for Christ, the Lord.<br/>
Heads lifted high, <br/>
Catholic Action our cry, <br/>
And the Cross our only sword.<br/>
On earth's battlefield <br/>
Never a vantage we'll yield. <br/>
As dauntlessly on we swing<br/>
Comrades true, dare and do <br/>
'Neath the Queen's white and blue,<br/>
For our flag, for our faith, <br/>
For Christ the King.<br/>
Christ lifts His hands, <br/>
The King commands; challenge, 'Come and follow me.'<br/>
<br/>
From ev'ry side, <br/>
With eager stride, <br/>
We form in the lines of victory.<br/>
Let foemen lurk, <br/>
And laggards shirk, <br/>
We throw our fortunes to the Lord<br/>
Mary's Son, <br/>
Till the world is won, <br/>
WE have pledged you our loyal word.<br/>

Where Jesus bled and died;<br/>
When your debt was paid by the precious blood<br/>
That flowed from His wounded side?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
He died an atoning death for thee,<br/>
He died an atoning death;<br/>
O wondrous love! it was for thee<br/>
He died an atoning death!<br/>

Have you read how they placed the crown of thorns<br/>
Upon His kingly brow?<br/>
How He cried: "Forgive them, O forgive,<br/>
They know not what they do."<br/>
<br/>
Have you read how the dying thief was saved<br/>
While hanging on the tree?<br/>
When he looked with pleading eyes and said,<br/>
"Dear Lord, remember me."<br/>
<br/>
Have you read that He looked to heav'n and said:<br/>
"'Tis finished"— 'twas for thee?<br/>
Have you ever said: "I thank Thee, Lord,<br/>
For giving Thy life for me"?

An awe-full mystery is here<br/>
To challenge faith and waken fear:<br/>
The Savior comes as food divine,<br/>
Concealed in earthly bread and wine.<br/>
<br/>
This world is loveless—but above<br/>
What wondrous boundlessness of love!<br/>
The King of Glory stoops to me<br/>
My spirit’s life and strength to be.<br/>
<br/>
In consecrated wine and bread<br/>
No eye perceives the mystery dread;<br/>
But Jesus’ words are strong and clear;<br/>
“My body and My blood are here."<br/>
<br/>
How dull are all the powers of sense<br/>
Employed on proofs of love immense!<br/>
The richest food remains unseen,<br/>
And highest gifts appear—how mean!<br/>
<br/>
But here we have no boon on earth,<br/>
And faith alone discerns its worth.<br/>
The Word, not sense, must be our guide,<br/>
And faith assure since sight’s denied.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, show us still that Thou art good<br/>
And grant us evermore this food.<br/>
Give faith to every wavering soul<br/>
And make each wounded spirit whole.<br/>

Here I labor and toil as I look for a home<br/>
Just an humble abode among men<br/>
While in Heaven a mansion is waiting for me<br/>
And a gentle voice pleading "come in"<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
There's a mansion now empty, just waiting for me<br/>
At the end of life's troublesome way<br/>
Many friends and dear loved ones will welcome me there<br/>
Near the door of that mansion some day<br/>
<br/>
When my labor and toiling have ended below<br/>
And my hands shall lie folded in rest<br/>
I'll exchange this old home for a mansion up there<br/>
And invite the arch angel as guest<br/>

"Once for all I gave my life on Calv'ry;<br/>

An empty tomb will always be a witness;<br/>
I'm not coming this way anymore."<br/>
<br/>
In my dreams I wandered back to Calv'ry,<br/>
To the place where Jesus bled and died.<br/>
In His hands my eyes beheld the nail scars;<br/>
And I saw the spear wound in His side. <br/>
<br/>
As my tho'ts then wandered to the garden,<br/>
To the tomb wherein my Savior lay.<br/>
There the angel came and rolled the stone away;<br/>
He was gone - He is alive today! <br/>
<br/>
As I stooped and looked into the tomb there,<br/>
With the grave clothes lying separately,<br/>
As today I ponder all the reasons,<br/>
Seems I hear my Savior say to me: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chorus<br/>
"Once for all I gave my life on Calv'ry;<br/>
I am now alive forever more,<br/>

I'm not coming this way anymore. <br/>

there of the kingdom learned<br/>
the mysteries sublime;<br/>

An image of that heavenly light,<br/>
the goal the Church keeps ay in sight,<br/>
Christ on the holy mount displays<br/>
where he outshines the sun's bright rays.<br/>
<br/>
Let every age proclaimer be<br/>
how, on this day, the chosen three<br/>
with Moses and Elias heard<br/>
the Lord speak many a gracious word.<br/>
<br/>
As witnesses to grace are nigh<br/>
those twain, the Law and Prophecy;<br/>
and to the Son, from out the cloud,<br/>
the Father's record thunders loud.<br/>
<br/>
With garments whiter than the snows,<br/>
and shining face, Lord Jesus shows<br/>
what glory for those saints shall be<br/>
who joy in God with piety.<br/>
<br/>
The vision and the mystery<br/>
make faithful hearts beat quick and high,<br/>
so on this solemn day of days<br/>
the cry goes up of prayer and praise.<br/>

O God the Father, God the Son,<br/>
and Holy Spirit, Three in One,<br/>

An upper room did our Lord prepare<br/>
for those he loved until the end:<br/>
and his disciples still gather there,<br/>
to celebrate their Risen Friend.<br/>
<br/>
A lasting gift Jesus gave his own,<br/>
to share his bread, his loving cup.<br/>
Whatever burdens may bow us down,<br/>
he by his Cross shall lift us up.<br/>
<br/>
And after Supper he washed their feet,<br/>
for service, too, is sacrament.<br/>
In him our joy shall be made complete<br/>
sent out to serve, as he was sent.<br/>
<br/>
No end there is! We depart in peace.<br/>
He loves beyond our uttermost:<br/>
in every room in our Father's house<br/>
he will be there, as Lord and host.<br/>

Long my restless soul had sought<br/>
Refuge from the troubled sea;<br/>
Struggling vainly till I thought<br/>
There was no repose for me;<br/>
Jesus whispered ’mid the storm,<br/>
“Trust Mine everlasting arm." <br/>
<br/>
As my spirit, terror-filled,<br/>
Breasted storm and tide alone,<br/>
Jesus came—the tempest stilled,<br/>
Hushed its loud and angry moan;<br/>
Standing on the restless wave,<br/>
Reached His hand my soul to save. <br/>
<br/>
Jesus, Master of the sea,<br/>
Never let my vessel strand;<br/>
Keep me sheltered in the lee,<br/>
In the hollow of Thy hand,<br/>
Free from storm and tempest shock,<br/>
Anchored deeply in the rock. <br/>
<br/>
Safely by the rock-bound coast,<br/>
And the treach’rous breakers past,<br/>
Guide me, lest my way be lost,<br/>
Into heaven’s port at last;<br/>
Stormy seas no more I’ll sail—<br/>
Safe at last within the veil. <br/>

Ancient of Days, who sittest throned in glory,<br/>
To Thee all knees are bent, all voices pray;<br/>
Thy love has blessed the wide world’s wondrous story<br/>
With light and life since Eden’s dawning day.<br/>
<br/>
O Holy Father, Who hadst led Thy children<br/>
In all the ages, with the fire and cloud,<br/>
Through seas dry shod, through weary wastes bewildering;<br/>
To Thee, in reverent love, our hearts are bowed.<br/>
<br/>
O Holy Jesus, Prince of Peace and Savior,<br/>
To Thee we owe the peace that still prevails,<br/>
Stilling the rude wills of men’s wild behavior,<br/>
And calming passion’s fierce and stormy gales.<br/>
<br/>
O Holy Ghost, the Lord and the Lifegiver,<br/>
Thine is the quickening power that gives increase;<br/>
From Thee have flowed, as from a pleasant river,<br/>
Our plenty, wealth, prosperity and peace.<br/>
<br/>
O Triune God, with heart and voice adoring,<br/>
Praise we the goodness that doth crown our days;<br/>
Pray we that Thou wilt hear us, still imploring<br/>
Thy love and favor kept to us always.<br/>

1. And Am I Blessed With Jesus' Love<br/>
And shall I dwell with Him above,<br/>
And will the joyful period come<br/>
When I shall call the heav'ns my home?<br/>
<br/>
2. Think, O my soul! What must it be<br/>
A world of glorious minds to see,<br/>
Drink at the fountain-head of peace,<br/>
And bathe in everlasting bliss!<br/>
<br/>
3. To hear them all at once proclaim<br/>
Eternal glories to the Lamb,<br/>
And join with joyful heart and tongue<br/>
That new, that never-ending song!<br/>
<br/>
4. And does the happy hour draw near<br/>
When Christ will in the clouds appear,<br/>
And I without a vail shall see<br/>
The Man, the Christ, who bled for me?<br/>
<br/>
5. If in my soul such joys abound<br/>
While weeping faith explores His wound,<br/>
How glorious will those scars appear<br/>
When perfect love forbids a tear!<br/>
<br/>
6. Think, O my soul, if 't is so sweet<br/>
On earth to sit at Jesus' feet,<br/>
What must it be to wear a crown<br/>
And sit with Jesus on the throne!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andamionlyborntodie.php



And am I only born to die?<br/>
And must I suddenly comply<br/>
With nature’s stern decree?<br/>
What after death for me remains?<br/>
Celestial joys, or hellish pains,<br/>
To all eternity?<br/>
<br/>
How then ought I on earth to live,<br/>
While God prolongs the kind reprieve<br/>
And props the house of clay?<br/>
My sole concern, my single care,<br/>
To watch, and tremble, and prepare<br/>
Against the fatal day.<br/>
<br/>
No room for mirth or trifling here,<br/>
For worldly hope, or worldly fear,<br/>
If life so soon is gone:<br/>
If now the Judge is at the door,<br/>
And all mankind must stand before<br/>
The inexorable throne!<br/>
<br/>
No matter which my thoughts employ,<br/>
A moment’s misery, or joy;<br/>
But O! when both shall end,<br/>
Where shall I find my destined place?<br/>
Shall I my everlasting days<br/>
With fiends, or angels spend?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is worth a thought beneath<br/>
But how I may escape the death<br/>
That never, never dies;<br/>
How make mine own election sure,<br/>
And, when I fail on earth, secure<br/>
A mansion in the skies.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, vouchsafe a pitying ray,<br/>
Be Thou my guide, be Thou my way<br/>
To glorious happiness;<br/>
Ah, write the pardon on my heart,<br/>
And whensoe’er I hence depart,<br/>
Let me depart in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andareweyetalive.php



And are we yet alive,<br/>
And see each other’s face?<br/>
Glory and thanks to Jesus give<br/>
For His almighty grace!<br/>
<br/>
Preserved by power divine<br/>
To full salvation here,<br/>
Again in Jesus’ praise we join<br/>
And in His sight appear.<br/>
<br/>
What troubles have we seen,<br/>
What mighty conflicts past,<br/>
Fightings without, and fears within,<br/>
Since we assembled last!<br/>
<br/>
Yet out of all the Lord<br/>
Hath brought us by His love;<br/>
And still He doth His help afford,<br/>
And hides our life above.<br/>
<br/>
Then let us make our boast<br/>
Of His redeeming power,<br/>
Which saves us to the uttermost,<br/>
Till we can sin no more.<br/>
<br/>
Let us take up the cross<br/>
Till we the crown obtain,<br/>
And gladly reckon all things loss<br/>
So we may Jesus gain.<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andartthoucometoustodwell.php



And art Thou come with us to dwell,<br/>
Our Prince, our Guide, our Love, our Lord?<br/>
And is Thy Name Emmanuel,<br/>
God present with His world restored?<br/>
<br/>
The heart is glad for Thee! It knows<br/>
None now shall bid it err or mourn;<br/>
And o’er its desert breaks the rose<br/>
In triumph o’er the grieving thorn.<br/>
<br/>
Thou bringest all again; with Thee<br/>
Is light, is space, is breadth and room<br/>
For each thing fair, beloved, and free<br/>
To have its hour of life and bloom.<br/>
<br/>
The world is glad for Thee! the heart<br/>
Is glad for Thee! and all is well,<br/>
And fixed and sure, because Thou art,<br/>
Whose Name is called Emmanuel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andcaniyetdelay.php



And can I yet delay<br/>
My little all to give?<br/>
To tear my soul from earth away<br/>
For Jesus to receive?<br/>
<br/>
Nay, but I yield, I yield;<br/>
I can hold out no more;<br/>
I sink, by dying love compelled,<br/>
And own Thee Conqueror.<br/>
<br/>
Though late, I all forsake;<br/>
My friends, my all, resign;<br/>
Gracious Redeemer, take, O take,<br/>
And seal me ever Thine!<br/>
<br/>
Come, and possess me whole,<br/>
Nor hence again remove;<br/>
Settle and fix my wavering soul<br/>
With all Thy weight of love.<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andcanitbethatishouldgain.php



And can it be that I should gain<br/>
An interest in the Savior’s blood?<br/>
Died He for me, who caused His pain—<br/>
For me, who Him to death pursued?<br/>
Amazing love! How can it be,<br/>
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?<br/>
Amazing love! How can it be,<br/>
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?<br/>
<br/>
’Tis mystery all: th’Immortal dies:<br/>
Who can explore His strange design?<br/>
In vain the firstborn seraph tries<br/>
To sound the depths of love divine.<br/>
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,<br/>
Let angel minds inquire no more.<br/>
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore;<br/>
Let angel minds inquire no more.<br/>
<br/>
He left His Father’s throne above<br/>
So free, so infinite His grace—<br/>
Emptied Himself of all but love,<br/>
And bled for Adam’s helpless race:<br/>
’Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br/>
For O my God, it found out me!<br/>
’Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br/>
For O my God, it found out me!<br/>
<br/>
Long my imprisoned spirit lay,<br/>
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;<br/>
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray—<br/>
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br/>
My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.<br/>
My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Still the small inward voice I hear,<br/>
That whispers all my sins forgiven;<br/>
Still the atoning blood is near,<br/>
That quenched the wrath of hostile Heaven.<br/>
I feel the life His wounds impart;<br/>
I feel the Savior in my heart.<br/>
I feel the life His wounds impart;<br/>
I feel the Savior in my heart.<br/>
<br/>
No condemnation now I dread;<br/>
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;<br/>
Alive in Him, my living Head,<br/>
And clothed in righteousness divine,<br/>
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,<br/>
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.<br/>
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,<br/>
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.<br/>

And did those feet in ancient time<br/>
Walk upon England’s mountains green?<br/>
And was the Holy Lamb of God<br/>
On England’s pleasant pastures seen?<br/>
And did the countenance divine<br/>
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?<br/>
And was Jerusalem builded here<br/>
Among these dark satanic mills?<br/>
<br/>
Bring me my bow of burning gold!<br/>
Bring me my arrows of desire!<br/>
Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!<br/>
Bring me my chariot of fire!<br/>
I will not cease from mental fight,<br/>
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,<br/>
Till we have built Jerusalem<br/>
In England’s green and pleasant land.<br/>
<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andidstthoulovetherace.php



And didst Thou love the race that loved not Thee?<br/>
And didst Thou take to Heaven a human brow?<br/>
Dost plead with man’s voice by the marvelous sea?<br/>
Art Thou his Kinsman now?<br/>
<br/>
O God, O Kinsman loved, but not enough,<br/>
O Man, with eyes majestic after death,<br/>
Whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough,<br/>
Whose lips drawn human breath!<br/>
<br/>
By that one likeness which is ours and Thine,<br/>
By that one nature which doth hold us kin,<br/>
By that high Heaven where, sinless, Thou dost shine<br/>
To draw us sinners in;<br/>
<br/>
By Thy last silence in the judgment hall,<br/>
By long foreknowledge of the deadly tree,<br/>
By darkness, by the wormwood and the gall,<br/>
I pray Thee visit me.<br/>
<br/>
Come, lest this heart should, cold and cast away,<br/>
Die ere the Guest adored she entertain—<br/>
Lest eyes which never saw Thine earthly day<br/>
Should miss Thy heavenly reign.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

And dost Thou say, “Ask what thou wilt"?<br/>
Lord, I would seize the golden hour;<br/>
I pray to be released from guilt,<br/>
And freed from sin and Satan’s power.<br/>
<br/>
More of Thy presence, Lord, impart,<br/>
More of Thine image let me bear;<br/>
Erect Thy throne within my heart,<br/>
And reign without a rival there.<br/>
<br/>
Give me to read my pardon sealed,<br/>
And from Thy joy to draw my strength;<br/>
To have Thy boundless love revealed<br/>
In all its height, and breadth, and length.<br/>
<br/>
Grant these requests—I ask no more,<br/>
But to Thy care the rest resign;<br/>
Living or dying, rich or poor,<br/>
All shall be well if Thou art mine.<br/>

1. And Have I, Christ, No Love for Thee<br/>
Nor passion for thy charms?<br/>
Nor wish my Savior's face to see<br/>
And dwell with His arms?<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there no spark of gratitude<br/>
In this cold heart of mine,<br/>
To Him whose gen'rous bosom glowed<br/>
With friendship all divine?<br/>
<br/>
3. Can I pronounce His charming name,<br/>
His acts of kindness tell,<br/>
And while I dwell upon the theme,<br/>
No sweet emotion feel?<br/>
<br/>
4. Such base ingratitude as this,<br/>
What heart but must detest?<br/>
Sure Christ deserves the noblest place<br/>
In ev'ry human breast.<br/>
<br/>
5. A very wretch, Lord, I should prove,<br/>
Had I no love to thee:<br/>
Rather than not my Savior love,<br/>
O may I cease to be.<br/>
<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/and_i_beheld_and_i_heard.php

And I beheld and I heard<br/>
The voice of many angels<br/>
Round about the throne<br/>
And the beasts and the elders<br/>
And the number to them<br/>
Was ten thousand times ten thousand<br/>
And thousands and thousands<br/>
Saying with a loud voice:<br/>
<br/>
Blessing and Honor and Glory and Power<br/>
Be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne<br/>
And unto the Lamb, forever and ever<br/>
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/and_i_love_you_so.php

And I love you so<br/>
The people ask me how<br/>
How I've lived till now<br/>
I tell them I don't know<br/>
(With lead-in)<br/>
I guess they understand<br/>
How lonely life has been<br/>
But life began again<br/>
The day you took my hand<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
And yes I know how lonely life can be<br/>
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free<br/>
But I won't let the evening bring me down<br/>
Now that you're around me<br/>
<br/>
And I love you too (love you)<br/>
Your thoughts are just for me (just for me)<br/>
You set my spirit free (set me free)<br/>
I'm happy that you do<br/>
<br/>
The book of life is brief (book of life is brief)<br/>
And once a page is read (once a page is read)<br/>
All but love is brief<br/>
That is my belief <br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus <br/>

And is it so—I shall be like Thy Son?<br/>
Is this the grace which He for me has won?<br/>
Father of glory (thought beyond all thought!)—<br/>
In glory, to His own blest likeness brought!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like to Thee?<br/>
Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see<br/>
Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,<br/>
Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.<br/>
<br/>
Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest<br/>
Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest.<br/>
That love that gives not as the world, but shares<br/>
All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.<br/>
<br/>
Nor I alone; Thy loved ones all, complete<br/>
In glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet,<br/>
All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,<br/>
Object supreme of all, by all adored.<br/>
<br/>
The heart is satisfied; can ask no more<br/>
All thought of self is now forever o’er:<br/>
Christ, its un-mingled Object, fills the heart<br/>
In blest adoring love—the endless part.<br/>
<br/>
Father of mercies, in Thy presence bright<br/>
All this shall be unfolded in the light;<br/>
Thy children all, with joy Thy counsels know<br/>
Fulfilled; patient in hope, while here below.<br/>

<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/and_is_it_so_a_little_while.php

And is it so? “A little while,"<br/>
And then the life undying,<br/>
The light of God’s unclouded smile,<br/>
The singing for the sighing?<br/>
“A little while!" O glorious word,<br/>
Sweet solace of our sorrow;<br/>
And then “forever with the Lord,"<br/>
The everlasting morrow.<br/>
<br/>
Then be it ours to journey on<br/>
In paths that He decrees us,<br/>
Where His own feet before have gone,<br/>
Our strength, our hope, our Jesus;<br/>
In lowly fellowship with Him<br/>
The cross appointed bearing;<br/>
For O a crown no grief can dim<br/>
One day we shall be wearing.<br/>
<br/>
O ’twill be passing sweet to gaze<br/>
On Him in all His glory;<br/>
And lost in love and glad amaze<br/>
To shout redemption’s story;<br/>
Till angels bend to catch the strain<br/>
Our human lips are swelling,<br/>
And “worthy is the Lamb once slain,"<br/>
Resounds through Heaven’s high dwelling.<br/>
<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andisthetimeapproaching.php

And is the time approaching,<br/>
By prophets long foretold,<br/>
When all shall dwell together,<br/>
One Shepherd and one fold?<br/>
Shall every idol perish,<br/>
To moles and bats be thrown,<br/>
And every prayer be offered<br/>
To God in Christ alone?<br/>
<br/>
Shall Jew and Gentile, meeting<br/>
From many a distant shore,<br/>
Around one altar kneeling,<br/>
One common Lord adore?<br/>
Shall all that now divides us<br/>
Remove, and pass away<br/>
Like shadows of the morning<br/>
Before the blaze of day?<br/>
<br/>
Shall all that now unites us<br/>
More sweet and lasting prove,<br/>
A closer bond of union<br/>
In a blest land of love?<br/>
Shall war be learned no longer,<br/>
Shall strife and tumult cease;<br/>
All earth His blessèd kingdom,<br/>
The Lord and Prince of Peace?<br/>
<br/>
O long expected dawning,<br/>
Come with Thy cheering ray;<br/>
When shall the morning brighten,<br/>
The shadows flee away?<br/>
O sweet anticipation!<br/>
It cheers the watchers on<br/>
To pray, and hope, and labor,<br/>
Till the dark night be gone.<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andletourbodiespart.php

And let our bodies part,<br/>
To different climes repair;<br/>
Inseparably joined in heart<br/>
The friends of Jesus are.<br/>
<br/>
O let us still proceed<br/>
In Jesus’ work below;<br/>
And, following our triumphant Head,<br/>
To further conquests go!<br/>
<br/>
The vineyard of the Lord<br/>
Before His laborers lies;<br/>
And lo! we see the vast reward<br/>
Which waits us in the skies.<br/>
<br/>
O let our heart and mind<br/>
Continually ascend,<br/>
That haven of repose to find,<br/>
Where all our labors end.<br/>
<br/>
When all our toils are o’er,<br/>
Our suffering and our pain!<br/>
Who meet on that eternal shore<br/>
Shall never part again.<br/>
<br/>
O happy, happy place,<br/>
Where saints and angels meet;<br/>
There we shall see each other’s face,<br/>
And all our brethren greet.<br/>

https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andletthisfeeblebodyfail.php

And let this feeble body fail,<br/>
And let it droop and die;<br/>
My soul shall quit the mournful vale,<br/>
And soar to worlds on high;<br/>
Shall join the disembodied saints,<br/>
And find its long sought rest,<br/>
That only bliss for which it pants,<br/>
In my Redeemer’s breast.<br/>
<br/>
In hope of that immortal crown<br/>
I now the cross sustain,<br/>
And gladly wander up and down,<br/>
And smile at toil and pain:<br/>
I suffer out my threescore years,<br/>
Till my Deliverer come,<br/>
And wipe away His servant’s tears,<br/>
And take His exile home.<br/>
<br/>
O what hath Jesus bought for me!<br/>
Before my ravished eyes<br/>
Rivers of life divine I see,<br/>
And trees of paradise:<br/>
I see a world of spirits bright,<br/>
Who taste the pleasures there;<br/>
They all are robed in spotless white,<br/>
And conquering palms they bear.<br/>
<br/>
O what are all my sufferings here,<br/>
If, Lord, Thou count me meet<br/>
With that enraptured host to appear,<br/>
And worship at Thy feet!<br/>
Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,<br/>
Take life or friends away,<br/>
But let me find them all again<br/>
In that eternal day.<br/>

1. And may I hope that when no more<br/>
My pulse shall beat with life below,<br/>
I shall the God of grace adore,<br/>
And all the bliss of glory know?<br/>
<br/>
2. I, who deserve no place but hell.<br/>
No portion but devouring fire,<br/>
Shall I with Christ my Savior dwell,<br/>
Possessed of all I now desire?<br/>
<br/>
3. Will Jesus own a wretch like me,<br/>
And tell to saints and angels round,<br/>
That when he suffered on the tree,<br/>
My sins did cause his ev'ry wound?<br/>
<br/>
4. He will! I read it in his word,<br/>
And in my heart the witness feel;<br/>
I shall be with, and like my Lord,<br/>
Though sin oppose, in league with hell.<br/>
<br/>
5. I shall be with Him when he comes<br/>
Triumphant down the pathless skies;<br/>
And when his voice breaks up the tombs,<br/>
Among his children I shall rise.<br/>

https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andmustibetojudgmentbrought.php

And must I be to judgment brought,<br/>
And answer in that day,<br/>
For every vain and idle thought,<br/>
And every word I say? <br/>
<br/>
Yes, every secret of my heart,<br/>
Shall shortly be made known,<br/>
And I receive my just desert<br/>
For all that I have done.<br/>
<br/>
How careful, then ought I to live,<br/>
With what religious fear!<br/>
Who such a strict account must give<br/>
For my behavior here.<br/>
<br/>
Thou awful Judge of quick and dead,<br/>
The watchful power bestow;<br/>
So shall I to my ways take heed,<br/>
To all I speak or do.<br/>
<br/>
If now Thou standest at the door,<br/>
O let me feel Thee near,<br/>
And make my peace with God, before<br/>
I at Thy bar appear.<br/>

And Must this body die?<br/>
This mortal frame decay?<br/>
And must these active limbs of mine<br/>
Lie mould'ring in the clay?<br/>
<br/>
Corruption, earth, and worms<br/>
Shall but refine this flesh<br/>
Till my triumphant spirit comes<br/>
To put it on afresh.<br/>
<br/>
God my Redeemer lives,<br/>
And always from the skies<br/>
Looks down, and watches all my dust<br/>
Till he shall bid it rise.<br/>
<br/>
Arrayed in glorious grace<br/>
Shall these vile bodies shine.<br/>
And ev'ry shape and ev'ry face<br/>
Look heav'nly and divine.<br/>
<br/>
These lively hopes we owe.<br/>
To Jesus' saving love;<br/>
We would adore his grace below,<br/>
And sing his pow'r above.<br/>

And now, belovèd Lord, Thy Soul resigning,<br/>
Into Thy Father’s arms with conscious will,<br/>
Calmly, with reverend grace, Thy head inclining,<br/>
The throbbing brow and laboring breast grow still. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Freely Thy life Thou yieldest, meekly bending<br/>
E’en to the last beneath our sorrows’ load,<br/>
Yet strong in death, in perfect peace commending,<br/>
Thy Spirit to Thy Father and Thy God.<br/>
<br/>
My Savior, in mine hour of mortal anguish,<br/>
When earth grows dim, and round me falls the night,<br/>
O breathe Thy peace, as flesh and spirit languish,<br/>
At that dread eventide let there be light.<br/>
<br/>
To Thy dear cross turn Thou my eyes in dying;<br/>
Lay but my fainting head upon Thy breast;<br/>
Those outstretched arms receive my latest sighing;<br/>
And then, oh! then, Thine everlasting rest.<br/>
<br/>
O love! o’er mortal agony victorious,<br/>
Now is Thy triumph! now that cross shall shine<br/>
To earth’s remotest age revered and glorious,<br/>
Of suffering’s deepest mystery the sign.<br/>
<br/>
The present, past and future here are blending,<br/>
Moment supreme in this world’s history,<br/>
Mid darkness, opening graves, and mountains rending,<br/>
New light is dawning on humanity.<br/>

And now, my soul, another year<br/>
Of thy short life is past;<br/>
I cannot long continue here,<br/>
And this may be my last.<br/>
<br/>
Awake, my soul! with utmost care<br/>
Thy true condition learn;<br/>
What are thy hopes, how sure? how fair?<br/>
What is thy great concern?<br/>
<br/>
Behold, another year begins!<br/>
Set out afresh for Heaven;<br/>
Seek pardon for thy former sins,<br/>
In Christ so freely given.<br/>
<br/>
Devoutly yield thyself to God,<br/>
And on His grace depend;<br/>
With zeal pursue the heavenly road,<br/>
Nor doubt a happy end.<br/>

And now, O Father, mindful of the love<br/>
That bought us, once for all, on Calvary’s tree,<br/>
And having with us Him that pleads above,<br/>
We here present, we here spread forth to Thee,<br/>
That only offering perfect in Thine eyes,<br/>
The one true, pure, immortal sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Father, look on His anointed face,<br/>
And only look on us as found in Him;<br/>
Look not on our misusings of Thy grace,<br/>
Our prayer so languid, and our faith so dim;<br/>
For lo! between our sins and their reward,<br/>
We set the passion of Thy Son our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
And then for those, our dearest and our best,<br/>
By this prevailing presence we appeal;<br/>
O fold them closer to Thy mercy’s breast!<br/>
O do Thine utmost for their souls’ true weal!<br/>
From tainting mischief keep them white and clear,<br/>
And crown Thy gifts with strength to persevere.<br/>
<br/>
And so we come; O draw us to Thy feet,<br/>
Most patient Savior, Who canst love us still!<br/>
And by this food, so awful and so sweet,<br/>
Deliver us from every touch of ill:<br/>
In Thine own service make us glad and free,<br/>
And grant us nevermore to part with Thee.<br/>

And now the wants are told, that brought<br/>
Thy children to Thy knee;<br/>
Here lingering still, we ask for naught,<br/>
But simply worship Thee.<br/>
<br/>
The hope of Heav’n’s eternal days<br/>
Absorbs not all the heart<br/>
That gives Thee glory, love, and praise<br/>
For being what Thou art.<br/>
<br/>
For Thou art God, the One, the Same,<br/>
O’er all things high and bright;<br/>
And round us, when we speak Thy Name,<br/>
There spreads a heav’n of light.<br/>
<br/>
O wondrous peace, in thought to dwell<br/>
On excellence divine;<br/>
To know that naught in man can tell<br/>
How fair Thy beauties shine!<br/>
<br/>
O Thou, above all blessing blest,<br/>
O’er thanks exalted far,<br/>
Thy very greatness is a rest<br/>
To weaklings as we are;<br/>
<br/>
For when we feel the praise of Thee<br/>
A task beyond our powers,<br/>
We say, “A perfect God is He,<br/>
And He is fully ours."<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Father be,<br/>
All glory to the Son,<br/>
All glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,<br/>
While endless ages run.<br/>

And now this holy day<br/>
Is drawing to its end,<br/>
Once more, to Thee, O Lord,<br/>
Our thanks and prayers we send.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee for this rest<br/>
From earthly care and strife;<br/>
We thank Thee for this help<br/>
To higher, holier life.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee for Thy house;<br/>
It is Thy palace-gate<br/>
Where Thou, upon Thy throne<br/>
Of mercy, still dost wait.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee for Thy Word,<br/>
Thy Gospel’s joyful sound;<br/>
Oh, may its holy fruits<br/>
Within our hearts abound!<br/>
<br/>
Yet, ere we go to rest,<br/>
Father, to Thee we pray,<br/>
Forgive the sins that stain<br/>
E’en this Thy holy day.<br/>
<br/>
Through Jesus let the past<br/>
Be blotted from Thy sight,<br/>
And let us all now sleep<br/>
At peace with Thee this night.<br/>
<br/>
To God the Father, Son,<br/>
And Spirit glory be,<br/>
From all in earth and Heav’n,<br/>
Through all eternity.<br/>

I sang to the people in Russia<br/>
As they were searching for the truth<br/>
Their eyes were so cold and empty<br/>
From the eldest to the youth<br/>
What a privilege I had to carry<br/>
The joy of the God we love<br/>
And I sang of the Christ, His compassionate life<br/>
Of a home He's prepared above<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God because of me<br/>
<br/>
I sang to the people in Africa<br/>
Some who didn't have food to eat<br/>
In the depths of full-blown poverty<br/>
Most were living out in the street<br/>
What a thrill to deliver the Gospel<br/>
To a people who were so distressed<br/>
Holding back the tears and the cultural fears<br/>
Overwhelmingly I was impressed<br/>
<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God instead of me<br/>
<br/>
I sang to the people in my hometown<br/>
Trying to guess their minds<br/>
Most had already heard the precious Word<br/>
Of a God who's good and kind<br/>
As I sang I could tell that they knew it<br/>
I didn't sing for the joy of the song<br/>
But because of a Cross and a Savior's loss<br/>
To deliver mankind gone wrong<br/>
<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God in spite of me <br/>
<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God (praised God)<br/>
And they praised God because of me <br/>

Chorus:<br/>
And this is life eternal<br/>
That they might know thee, the only true God<br/>
And Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent <br/>
<br/>
I have glorified beyond the earth<br/>
I have finished the work which thou givest me to do<br/>
And now oh Father<br/>
Glorify thou me with thine own self<br/>
With the glory which I had with Thee<br/>
Before the world was (world was) <br/>
<br/>

 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/andtrulyitisamostgloriousthing.php

And truly it is a most glorious thing<br/>
Thus to hear men pray and God’s praises sing,<br/>
O how great comfort is it now to see—<br/>
The churches to enjoy full liberty.<br/>
And to have the Gospel preachèd here with power,<br/>
And such wolves repelled as all would else devour.<br/>
<br/>
But God will still for His people provide<br/>
Such as be able them to help and guide,<br/>
If they cleave to Him and do not forsake—<br/>
His laws and truth and their own ways do take.<br/>
If thou hast viewed the camp of Israel,<br/>
How God in the wilderness with them did dwell.<br/>
<br/>
His great and marvelous works they here saw,<br/>
And He them taught in His most holy law,<br/>
A small emblem hereof thou mayest see,<br/>
How God hath dealt with them in some degree,<br/>
For much of Himself they now there have seen,<br/>
And marvelous to them His works have been.<br/>

And will the Judge descend,<br/>
And must the dead arise<br/>
And not a single soul escape<br/>
His all discerning eyes?<br/>
<br/>
And from His righteous lips<br/>
Shall this dread sentence sound<br/>
And through the numerous guilty throng<br/>
Spread black despair around:<br/>
<br/>
“Depart from Me, accursed,<br/>
To everlasting flame,<br/>
For rebel angels first prepared,<br/>
Where mercy never came"?<br/>
<br/>
How will my heart endure<br/>
The terrors of that day<br/>
When earth and Heav’n before His face<br/>
Astonished shrink away?<br/>
<br/>
But ere that trumpet shakes<br/>
The mansions of the dead,<br/>
Hark from the Gospel’s cheering sound<br/>
What joyful tidings spread:<br/>
<br/>
Ye sinners, seek His grace<br/>
Whose wrath ye cannot bear;<br/>
Fly to the shelter of His cross<br/>
And find salvation there.<br/>

These walls we to Thy honor raise;<br/>

And Thou, descending, fill the place<br/>
With choicest tokens of Thy grace.<br/>
<br/>
Here let the great Redeemer reign,<br/>
With all the graces of His train;<br/>
While power divine His Word attends,<br/>
To conquer foes, and cheer His friends.<br/>

And in that great decisive day,<br/>
When God the nations shall survey,<br/>
May it before the world appear<br/>
That crowds were born to glory here.<br/>

A sinner such as I,<br/>
Although Thy book his crimes record,<br/>
Of such a crimson dye?<br/>

So deep are they engraved,<br/>
So terrible their fear,<br/>
The righteous scarcely shall be saved,<br/>
And where shall I appear?<br/>
<br/>
O Thou Physician blest,<br/>
Make clean my guilty soul<br/>
And me, by many a sin oppressed,<br/>

I know not how to praise<br/>
Thy mercy and Thy love;<br/>
But deign my soul from earth to raise<br/>
And learn from Thee above.<br/>

Angel of peace, thou hast wandered too long;<br/>
Spread thy white wings to the sunshine of love!<br/>
Come while our voices are blended in song,<br/>
Fly to our ark like the storm-beaten dove—<br/>
Fly to our ark on the wings of the dove;<br/>
Speed o’er the far-sounding billows of song,<br/>
Crowned with the olive leaf garland of love;<br/>
Angel of peace, thou hast waited too long!<br/>

Brothers we meet on this altar of thine,<br/>
Mingling the gifts we have gathered for thee;<br/>
Sweet with the odors of myrtle and pine,<br/>
Breeze of the prairie and breath of the sea—<br/>
Meadow and mountain and forest and sea;<br/>
Sweet is the fragrance of myrtle and pine,<br/>
Sweeter the incense we offer to thee,<br/>
Brothers once more round this altar of thine!<br/>
<br/>
Angels of Bethlehem, answer the strain!<br/>
Hark! a new birth-song is filling the sky!<br/>
Loud as the storm wind that tumbles the main,<br/>
Bid the full breath of the organ reply—<br/>
Loud let the tempest of voices reply;<br/>
Roll its long surge like the earth-shaking main!<br/>
Swell the vast song till it mounts to the sky!<br/>
Angels of Bethlehem, echo the strain!<br/>

Can it be that Thou regardest songs of sinful man?<br/>
Can we feel that Thou art near us and wilt hear us? Yea, we can.<br/>

Lord, we know Thy love rejoices o’er each work of Thine;<br/>
Thou didst ears and hands and voices for Thy praise combine;<br/>
Craftsman’s art and music’s measure for Thy pleasure didst design.<br/>

Here, great God, today we offer of Thine own to Thee;<br/>
And for Thine acceptance proffer, all unworthily,<br/>
Hearts and minds, and hands and voices, in our choicest melody.<br/>

Angels long to look into these things (repeat 3x)<br/>
The glory of Jesus <br/>

He has given us new birth into a living hope <br/>
Through his resurrection from the dead <br/>
He has given us a new birth into inheritance <br/>

Grief and trials, we have genuine faith <br/>

We are receiving the goal of our faith <br/>

He prophets intently searched, searched with the greatest care <br/>
To find the time when Christ would come <br/>
It was not revealed to those who were searching then <br/>
But now we know the glory of the Son <br/>
Concerning this salvation the grace that has come to us <br/>
Praise God the mystery's been revealed <br/>

Hail! victorious Jesus, hail!<br/>
On Thy cloud of glory sail<br/>
In long triumph through the sky,<br/>

Glorious Hero, through them ride:<br/>

Where is now, O death! thy sting?<br/>

Angel your march oppose,<br/>
Who still in strength excel,<br/>
Your secret, sworn, eternal foes,<br/>
Countless, invisible.<br/>
With rage that never ends<br/>
Their hellish arts they try;<br/>
Legions of dire malicious fiends,<br/>
And spirits enthroned on high.<br/>
<br/>
On earth the usurpers reign,<br/>
Exert their baneful power,<br/>
O’er the poor fallen sons of men<br/>
They tyrannize their hour:<br/>
But shall believers fear?<br/>
But shall believers fly?<br/>
Or see the bloody cross appear,<br/>
And all their power defy?<br/>
<br/>
Jesus’ tremendous Name<br/>
Puts all our foes to flight:<br/>
Jesus, the meek, the angry Lamb,<br/>
A Lion is in fight.<br/>
By all hell’s host withstood,<br/>
We all hell’s host o’erthrow;<br/>
And conquering them, through Jesus’ blood,<br/>
We still to conquer go.<br/>
<br/>
Our Captain leads us on;<br/>
He beckons from the skies,<br/>
And reaches out a starry crown,<br/>
And bids us take the prize:<br/>
“Be faithful unto death;<br/>
Partake My victory;<br/>
And thou shalt wear this glorious wreath.<br/>
And thou shalt reign with Me."<br/>

Check them ere they soil the lip.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Love one another thus saith the Savior,<br/>
Children obey the Father’s blest command,<br/>
Love each other, love each other,<br/>
’Tis the Father’s blest command.<br/>

Love is much too pure and holy,<br/>
Friendship is too sacred far,<br/>
For a moment’s reckless folly,<br/>
Thus to desolate and mar.<br/>

 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/anniversaryhymn.php

Our fathers, in the years grown dim, reared slowly, wall by wall<br/>
A holy dwelling place for Him, that filleth all in all.<br/>
They wrought His house of faith and prayer, the rainbow round the throne,<br/>
A precious temple builded fair on Christ the Cornerstone.<br/>
<br/>
The angel of the golden reed hath found the measure strait;<br/>
He hears the Great Foundation plead for ampler wall and gate.<br/>
The living pillars of the Truth grown on from morn to morn,<br/>
And still the heresy of youth is age’s creed outworn.<br/>
<br/>
But steadfast is their inner shrine wrought of the heart’s fine gold,<br/>
Its hunger and its thirst divine, with jewels manifold,<br/>
Red sard of pain, hope’s emerald gleam, white peace, no glory missed<br/>
Of righteous life and saintly dream, jasper to amethyst.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit of truth, forbid that we who now God’s temple are<br/>
And keep the faith with minds more free, our father’s fabric mar.<br/>
Better than thoughts the stars that search is self still sacrificed,<br/>
For only love can build the church whose cornerstone is Christ.<br/>

There’s a voice I hear, and it calls me near<br/>
To the Savior’s bleeding side;<br/>
And it says to me, “You may now be free,<br/>
If you plunge beneath the crimson tide."<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O, I’ll take another look at the cross of Calvary,<br/>
For surely He can cleanse by the precious blood;<br/>
There is purity and power,<br/>
There is victory every hour,<br/>
When we’re living ’neath the smile of God.<br/>
<br/>
There is One above, looking down in love,<br/>
On a world deep sunk in sin;<br/>
And I hear Him call to His children all:<br/>
“Who will go and bring the lost ones in?"<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There’s a hand stretched out unto souls in doubt,<br/>
And it saves from sin and woe;<br/>
In His riven side is a fountain wide,<br/>
Where the vilest of the vile may go.<br/>

Refrain<br/>

O the bitter cries, and the longing eyes,<br/>
That we daily hear and see;<br/>
For our love they plead, and our help they need;<br/>
Shall we saviors of the lost ones be?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>

O the joy to stand on the golden strand,<br/>
Right before the great white throne;<br/>
There to meet some soul we have helped to the goal,<br/>

Another Sabbath day has come,<br/>
Another week is o’er;<br/>
And we, a grateful, happy throng,<br/>
Are gathered here once more:<br/>
We meet to sing of Jesus’ love,<br/>
And bow to Him in prayer,<br/>
We meet to read His holy Word,<br/>
And learn our duty there.<br/>
<br/>
Our Sunday school, our Sunday school;<br/>
No place on earth so dear!<br/>
How many precious souls have found<br/>
The way to glory here;<br/>
And now around the shining throne<br/>
They wait for us to come<br/>
And share with them the fadeless love<br/>
Of their eternal home.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, may the seed thus early sown<br/>
Spring up on goodly ground,<br/>
And in our hearts, our souls and lives<br/>
May fruit of grace abound—<br/>
Immortal fruit, that yet shall bloom<br/>
In paradise above,<br/>
Where we, with those now gone before,<br/>
Shall sing redeeming love.<br/>

Another six days’ work is done<br/>
Another Sabbath is begun;<br/>
Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,<br/>
Improve the day that God hath blest.<br/>
<br/>
Come, praise the Lord, Whose love assigns<br/>
So sweet a rest to weary minds;<br/>
Provides an antepast of Heaven<br/>
And gives this day the food of seven.<br/>
<br/>
O that our thoughts and thanks may rise<br/>
As grateful incense to the skies!<br/>
And draw from Heaven that sweet repose<br/>
Which none but he who feels it knows.<br/>
<br/>
A heavenly calm pervades the breast<br/>
Is the dear pledge of glorious rest,<br/>
Which for the Church of God remains,<br/>
The end of cares, the end of pains.<br/>
<br/>
With joy, great God, Thy works we view,<br/>
In various scenes, both old and new;<br/>
With praise we think on mercies past,<br/>
With hope we future pleasure taste.<br/>
<br/>
In holy duties let the day,<br/>
In holy comforts pass away;<br/>
The Sabbath thus we love to spend,<br/>
In hope of one which ne’er shall end.<br/>

I've (A) stood on the bank by the weeping willow,<br/>
With another wide river to cross.<br/>
(D) Another wide river to cross.<br/>
With (A) another wide river to cross.<br/>
I believe I can make it to the other side,<br/>
'Cos I feel a hand on me,<br/>
Helping (D) me with (E) another wide river to (A) cross.<br/>
<br/>
When I wake up to many a day,<br/>
With another wide river to cross. <br/>
Another wide river to cross.<br/>
Another wide river to cross.<br/>
I jump right in the dark and I swim right on, toward the light on the other 
side.<br/>
It's always there when there's another wide river to cross. <br/>
<br/>
(Key change to B for the rest of the song)<br/>
<br/>
Oh the (B) whirlpools twist and pull at me,<br/>
With another wide river to cross.<br/>
(E) Another wide river to cross.<br/>
With (B) another wide river to cross.<br/>
If I reach up a hand is always reaching down for me.<br/>
It's always (E) there when there's (F#) another wide river to (B) cross.<br/>
<br/>
Well the river Jordan is a narrow stream,<br/>
But it's another wide river to cross.<br/>
It's another wide river to cross.<br/>
Another wide river to cross.<br/>
But I believe that there's a resting place that's provided just for me,<br/>
On the heaven's side of another wide river to cross.<br/>

Another year completed,<br/>
The day comes round once more<br/>
Which with our patron’s radiance<br/>
Is bright as heretofore.<br/>
Now, strong in hope, united<br/>
His festival we greet;<br/>
He will present our troubles<br/>
Before the mercy-seat.<br/>
<br/>
The Scriptures tell how Moses<br/>
Did for the people pray,<br/>
Appeased the Judge eternal,<br/>
And turned His wrath away;<br/>
Elijah’s prayer had power,<br/>
To close and open Heav’n;<br/>
Such saints as were aforetime,<br/>
Such saints to us are giv’n.<br/>
<br/>
O saint of God, belovèd,<br/>
And placed on His right hand,<br/>
Thy prayers be like a rampart<br/>
As ’gainst the foe we stand;<br/>
For Abraham’s God is thy God,<br/>
And Isaac’s God is thine,<br/>
Thine is the God of Jacob,<br/>
The Lord of power benign.<br/>
<br/>
For forty years His Israel<br/>
He fed with angels’ food;<br/>
The flinty rock He opened<br/>
The streams of water flowed.<br/>
Entreat that Christ His people<br/>
May lead to victory:<br/>
The God of Joshua’s triumph<br/>
The Lord thy God is He.<br/>

Another year of mercies, of faithfulness and grace,<br/>
Another year of gladness in the shining of Thy face;<br/>
Another year of leaning upon Thy loving breast;<br/>
Another year of trusting, of quiet, happy rest.<br/>

Untold joys by faith I see,<br/>
Untold happiness to be<br/>
Mine forevermore. <br/>

Approach, my soul, the mercy seat,<br/>
Where Jesus answers prayer;<br/>
There humbly fall before His feet,<br/>
For none can perish there.<br/>
<br/>
Thy promise is my only plea,<br/>
With this I venture nigh;<br/>
Thou callest burdened souls to Thee,<br/>
And such, O Lord, am I.<br/>
<br/>
Bowed down beneath a load of sin,<br/>
By Satan sorely pressed,<br/>
By war without and fears within,<br/>
I come to Thee for rest.<br/>
<br/>
Be Thou my Shield and hiding Place,<br/>
That, sheltered by Thy side,<br/>
I may my fierce accuser face,<br/>
And tell him Thou hast died!<br/>
<br/>
O wondrous love! to bleed and die,<br/>
To bear the cross and shame,<br/>
That guilty sinners, such as I,<br/>
Might plead Thy gracious Name.<br/>
<br/>
“Poor tempest-tossèd soul, be still;<br/>
My promised grace receive";<br/>
’Tis Jesus speaks—I must, I will,<br/>
I can, I do believe.<br/>

Are all the foes of Sion fools,<br/>
Who thus devour her saints?<br/>
Do they not know her Savior rules,<br/>
And pities her complaints?<br/>
<br/>
They shall be seized with sad surprise;<br/>
For God’s revenging arm<br/>
Scatters the bones of them that rise<br/>
To do His children harm.<br/>
<br/>
In vain the sons of Satan boast<br/>
Of armies in array;<br/>
When God has first despised their host<br/>
They fall an easy prey.<br/>
<br/>
O for a word from Zion’s King,<br/>
Her captives to restore!<br/>
Jacob with all his tribes shall sing,<br/>
And Judah weep no more.<br/>

We must be clean,<br/>

Without holiness your life were spent in vain,<br/>
Though a profession you may yet maintain;<br/>
Naught but the life of Christ within the soul<br/>
Will avail to help you reach the final goal. <br/>

He will surely keep you pure and white within,<br/>
Give you dominion over every sin;<br/>
But if you still refuse His wondrous grace,<br/>
You will flee in terror from before His face. <br/>

Sat a hopeless blind man begging,<br/>
By the road to Jericho.<br/>
Soon he heard the noise of footsteps,<br/>
As of waters rolling nigh;<br/>
For the Galilean Prophet<br/>
With the throng was passing by. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Then arise, He calleth thee,<br/>
Sick or suff’ring, blind or lame!<br/>
Jesus healed in Galilee,<br/>
He is evermore the same. <br/>
<br/>
When he heard that it was Jesus,<br/>
Who had healed the sin-sick soul,<br/>
Then he called aloud for mercy,<br/>
That he, too, might be made whole.<br/>
But the multitude rebuked him,<br/>
Saying he should silent be;<br/>
Yet he only called more loudly,<br/>
“Have compassion, Lord, on me!" <br/>
<br/>
Paused the Master for a moment—<br/>
“Bring him hither unto Me."<br/>
Someone ran to bear the message:<br/>
“Come, arise, He calleth thee!"<br/>
Oh, what words of cheer and comfort!<br/>
What today could sweeter be<br/>
To the weary, sick, and suff’ring—<br/>
“Come, arise, He calleth thee"? <br/>
<br/>
Then as he approached the Master,<br/>
Healing virtue to receive,<br/>
Jesus said, “Thy faith hath saved thee,<br/>
Be it as thou dost believe."<br/>
And the blind man’s eyes were opened,<br/>
He had proved the promise true;<br/>
Ye, who still in sickness languish,<br/>
Lo, the Master calls for you. <br/>

NOT A WORD WAS HEARD AT THE TOMB THAT DAY<br/>
JUST SHUFFLING SOLDIERS FEET AS THEY GUARDED THE GRAVE<br/>
ONE DAY TWO DAYS THREE DAYS HAD PASSED<br/>
COULD IT BE THAT JESUS HAD BREATHED HIS LAST<br/>
COULD IT BE THAT HIS FATHER HAD FORSAKEN HIM<br/>
TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS SON DESPISING OUR SIN<br/>
ALL HELL SEEMED TO WHISPER JUST FORGET IT HE'S DEAD<br/>
THEN THE FATHER LOOKED DOWN TO HIS SON AND SAID<br/>
<br/>
ARISE MY LOVE ARISE MY LOVE<br/>
THE GRAVE NO LONGER HAS A HOLD ON YOU<br/>
NO MORE DEATH'S STING NO MORE SUFFERING<br/>
ARISE ARISE MY LOVE (ARISE-LAST TIME)<br/>
<br/>
THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE TOMB BEGAN TO SHAKE<br/>
AND LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN THE STONE WAS ROLLED AWAY<br/>
AND AS DEAD MEN THE GUARDS THEY ALL STOOD THERE IN FRIGHT<br/>
AS THE POWER OF LOVE DISPLAYED IT'S MIGHT<br/>
THEN SUDDENLY A MELODY FILLED THE AIR<br/>
RIDING WINGS OF WIND IT WAS EVERYWHERE<br/>
THE WORDS THAT CREATION HAD BEEN LONGING TO HEAR<br/>
THE SWEET SOUND OF VICTORY SO LOUD AND CLEAR<br/>
<br/>
SIN WHERE ARE YOUR SHACKLES DEATH WHERE IS YOUR STING<br/>
HELL HAS BEEN DEFEATED THE GRAVE COULD NOT HOLD THE KING!https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/arisemysoularise.php

Arise, my soul, arise; shake off thy guilty fears;<br/>
The bleeding sacrifice in my behalf appears:<br/>
Before the throne my surety stands,<br/>
Before the throne my surety stands,<br/>
My name is written on His hands.<br/>
<br/>
He ever lives above, for me to intercede;<br/>
His all redeeming love, His precious blood, to plead:<br/>
His blood atoned for all our race,<br/>
His blood atoned for all our race,<br/>
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.<br/>
<br/>
Five bleeding wounds He bears; received on Calvary;<br/>
They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me:<br/>
“Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,<br/>
“Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,<br/>
“Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"<br/>
<br/>
The Father hears Him pray, His dear anointed One;<br/>
He cannot turn away, the presence of His Son;<br/>
His Spirit answers to the blood,<br/>
His Spirit answers to the blood,<br/>
And tells me I am born of God.<br/>
<br/>
My God is reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear;<br/>
He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear:<br/>
With confidence I now draw nigh,<br/>
With confidence I now draw nigh,<br/>
And “Father, Abba, Father," cry.<br/>

Arise, my soul, my joyful powers,<br/>
And triumph in my God;<br/>
Awake, my voice, and loud proclaim<br/>
His glorious grace abroad.<br/>
<br/>
He raised me from the deeps of sin,<br/>
The gates of gaping hell,<br/>
And fixed my standing more secure<br/>
Than ’twas before I fell.<br/>
<br/>
The arms of everlasting love<br/>
Beneath my soul He placed;<br/>
And on the Rock of ages set<br/>
My slippery footsteps fast.<br/>
<br/>
The city of my blessed abode<br/>
Is walled around with grace,<br/>
Salvation for a bulwark stands<br/>
To shield the sacred place.<br/>
<br/>
Satan may vent his sharpest spite,<br/>
And all his legions roar;<br/>
Almighty mercy guards my life,<br/>
And bounds his raging power.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, my soul; awake, my voice,<br/>
And tunes of pleasure sing;<br/>
Loud hallelujahs shall address<br/>
My Savior and my King.<br/>

Arise my soul and greet 
him, the Lord who reigns on high. <br/>
Sing out your praises loudly, let triumph fill the sky. <br/>
He chose me and he saved me, from darkness and despair, <br/>
He knew me and he loved me, before I had a care. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stand to greet my maker, He formed me out of dust, <br/>
Since life began I've wandered, <br/>
not knowing whom to trust. <br/>
Not worthy of the mercy, <br/>
that Christ bestowed on me, <br/>
I'll rise and Praise the Lord now, <br/>
His grace has set me free. <br/>
<br/>
My God has saved me fully, <br/>
now I will always be, <br/>
His servant and His worker, <br/>
whose sights are set on He. <br/>
Now that my soul's been pardoned, <br/>
for sins beyond degree, <br/>
I'll fight the fight till death comes, <br/>
Then live eternally. <br/>

To torrents melt my streaming eyes;<br/>
And thou, my heart, with anguish feel<br/>
Those evils which thou canst not heal.<br/>
<br/>
See human nature sunk in shame!<br/>
See scandals poured on Jesus’ Name!<br/>
The Father wounded thro’ the Son;<br/>
The world abused, the soul undone!<br/>

See the short course of vain delight,<br/>
Closing in everlasting night—<br/>
In flames that no abatement know,<br/>
Tho’ briny tears forever flow.<br/>

His children evermore.<br/>

To Him your salutation,<br/>
Who bringeth great salvation,<br/>
And bids the sinner live.<br/>

The King in grace remembers<br/>
His loved ones here below<br/>
With gifts of royal treasures,<br/>
Yea, doth Himself bestow<br/>
Through His blest Word and grace.<br/>
O King, arrayed in splendor,<br/>
To Thee all praise we’ll render<br/>
Here and there face to face.<br/>

Upon these feet which he hath shod. <br/>
He guards us with his heavenly sword, <br/>
Which is his own, almighty Word. <br/>
<br/>
But do we thank him for his deeds? <br/>
For tending to our every need? <br/>
No, we think we had all the wit, <br/>
And our Lord Jesus we emit. <br/>
<br/>
The mocker pride’s our sure demise. <br/>
Why listen to the devil’s lies? <br/>
For pride will come before a fall, <br/>
Oh, sinner listen to my call! <br/>
<br/>
The dragon pride, creeps in on us; <br/>
What happened to our selflessness? <br/>
We need to see that we are low, <br/>
Arise! Obey! to God follow! <br/>

Say to the heathen from Thy throne,<br/>
“I am Jehovah, God alone";<br/>

The blood that flowed from Jesus’ side.<br/>

O bring the tribes of Israel home;<br/>
And let our wondering eyes behold<br/>
Gentiles and Jews in Jesus’ fold.<br/>

Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,<br/>
With shield of faith and Spirit’s sword.<br/>
Forth to the battle may they go<br/>
And boldly fight against the foe.<br/>

With banner of the cross unfurled,<br/>
They overcome the evil world<br/>
And so at last receive from Thee<br/>
The palm and crown of victory.<br/>
<br/>
Come, ever blessèd Spirit, come<br/>
And make Thy servants’ heart Thy home.<br/>
May each a living temple be<br/>
Hallowed forever, Lord, to Thee.<br/>

Enrich that temple’s holy shrine<br/>
With sevenfold gifts of grace divine;<br/>
With wisdom, light, and knowledge bless,<br/>
With counsel, strength, and godliness.<br/>

O Trinity in Unity,<br/>
One only God in Persons Three,<br/>
In Whom, through Whom, by Whom, we live,<br/>

God ever blest, and God alone.<br/>

Their golden crowns they fling<br/>
Before His throne of light,<br/>
And strike the rapturous string,<br/>

“Earth, Heav’n, and sea, Thy praise declare;<br/>
For Thine they are, and Thine shall be.<br/>

“O holy, holy, Lord,<br/>
Creation’s sovereign King!<br/>
Thy majesty adored<br/>
Let all creation sing;<br/>
Who wast, and art, and art to be;<br/>
Nor time shall see Thy sway depart.<br/>

“Great are Thy works of praise,<br/>
O God of boundless might;<br/>
All just and true Thy ways,<br/>
Thou King of saints, in light:<br/>
Let all above, and all below,<br/>

Some wait around Him ready still<br/>
To sing His praise and do His will,<br/>

To guard His servants here below.<br/>

Lord, give Thine angels every day<br/>
Command to guard us on our way,<br/>
And bid them every evening keep<br/>
Their watch around us while we sleep.<br/>

To do us harm or cause us fear;<br/>
And we shall dwell, when life is past,<br/>
With angels round Thy throne at last.<br/>

Why pour'st thou forth thine anxious plaint,<br/>

Despairing of relief,<br/>
As if the Lord o'erlooked thy cause,<br/>
And did not heed thy grief?<br/>
Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard,<br/>
That firm remains on high<br/>
The everlasting throne of Him<br/>
Who formed the earth and sky?<br/>

Art thou afraid his pow'r shall fail<br/>
When comes thy evil day?<br/>
And can an all-creating arm<br/>
Grow weary or decay?<br/>
Supreme in wisdom as in pow'r<br/>
The Rock of ages stands;<br/>
Though him thou canst not see,<br/>
nor trace The working of his hands.<br/>
<br/>
He gives the conquest to the weak,<br/>
Supports the fainting heart;<br/>
And courage in the evil hour<br/>
His heav'nly aids impart.<br/>
Mere human pow'r shall fast decay,<br/>
And youthful vigor cease;<br/>
But they who wait upon the Lord,<br/>
In strength shall still increase.<br/>
<br/>
They with unwearied feet shall tread<br/>
The path of life divine;<br/>
With growing ardor onward move,<br/>
With growing brightness shine.<br/>
On eagles' wings they mount, they soar,<br/>
Their wings are faith and love,<br/>
Till, past the cloudy regions here,<br/>
They rise to heav'n above. <br/>

<br/>
Hath He diadem, as monarch,<br/>
That His brow adorns?<br/>
Yes, a crown in very surety,<br/>
But of thorns.<br/>
<br/>
If I find Him, if I follow,<br/>
What His guerdon here?<br/>
Many a sorrow, many a labor,<br/>
Many a tear.<br/>
<br/>
If I still hold closely to Him,<br/>
What hath He at last?<br/>
Sorrow vanquished, labor ended,<br/>
Jordan passed.<br/>
<br/>
If I ask Him to receive me,<br/>
Will He say me nay?<br/>
Not till earth and not till Heaven<br/>
Pass away.<br/>
<br/>
Finding, following, keeping, struggling,<br/>
Is He sure to bless?<br/>
Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs,<br/>
Answer, Yes!<br/>

As a tree beside the water,<br/>
Has the Savior planted me;<br/>
All my fruit shall be in season,<br/>
I shall live eternally.<br/>

Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I shall not be moved,<br/>
I shall not be moved,<br/>
Anchored to the Rock of Ages,<br/>
I shall not be moved.<br/>

Through the storm my Lord I see,<br/>
Pointing upward to that haven,<br/>
Where my loved ones wait for me.<br/>

When by grief my heart is broken,<br/>
And the sunshine steals away,<br/>

Oh, what joy it will afford,<br/>
Just to see the sinner ransomed,<br/>
And behold my sovereign Lord.<br/>

As above the darkest storm cloud<br/>
Shines the sun, serenely bright<br/>
Waiting to restore to nature<br/>
All the glory of his light,<br/>
So, behind each cloud of sorrow,<br/>
So, in each affliction, stands,<br/>
Hid, an angel, with a blessing<br/>
From the Father in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
As without the tempest, pouring<br/>
O’er the earth the welcome rain,<br/>
All were but a fruitless desert,<br/>
Barren sand for ripen’ng grain,<br/>
So if ne’er a cloud of sadness<br/>
Veiled the sunshine of the soul,<br/>
If affliction’s waves were never<br/>
Suffered o’er the heart to roll.<br/>
<br/>
Love and faith might fail forever<br/>
To bring forth their fruits of peace;<br/>
Heaven’s good seed of truth would perish<br/>
In a thorny wilderness.<br/>
So, with cloud and storm and tempest<br/>
Grows our earthly summer dim,<br/>
That the rebel heart, our Father<br/>
Thus may win to turn to Him.<br/>

As birds their infant brood protect,<br/>
And spread their wings to shelter them,<br/>
Thus saith the Lord to His elect,<br/>
“So will I guard Jerusalem."<br/>
<br/>
And what then is Jerusalem,<br/>
This darling object of His cares?<br/>
Where is its worth in God’s esteem?<br/>
Who built it? Who inhabits there?<br/>
<br/>
Jehovah founded it in blood,<br/>
The blood of His incarnate Son;<br/>
There dwell the saints, once foes to God<br/>
The sinners whom He calls His own.<br/>
<br/>
There, though besieged on every side,<br/>
Yet much beloved and guarded well,<br/>
From age to age they have defied<br/>
The utmost force of earth and hell.<br/>
<br/>
Let earth repent, and hell despair,<br/>
This city has a sure defense;<br/>
Her name is called, “The Lord is there,"<br/>
And who has power to drive Him hence?<br/>

As it fell out upon one day,<br/>
Rich Divès made a feast,<br/>
And he invited all his friends,<br/>
And gentry of the best.<br/>
<br/>
Then Lazarus laid him down and down<br/>
And down at Divès’ door:<br/>
“Some meat and drink, brother, Diverus,<br/>
Bestow upon the poor."<br/>
<br/>
“Thou’rt none of my brothers, Lazarus,<br/>
That liest begging at my door;<br/>
No meat, nor drink will I give thee,<br/>
Nor bestow upon the poor."<br/>
<br/>
Then Lazarus laid him down and down,<br/>
All under Divès’ wall:<br/>
“Some meat, some drink, brother Diverus,<br/>
For hunger starve I shall."<br/>
<br/>
“Thou’rt none of my brothers, Lazarus,<br/>
That liest begging at my gate;<br/>
No meat, no drink will I give thee,<br/>
For Jesus Christ His sake."<br/>
<br/>
Then Divès sent out his hungry dogs,<br/>
To bite him as he lay;<br/>
They hadn’t the power to bite one bite,<br/>
But licked his sores away.<br/>
<br/>
Then Divès sent to his merry men,<br/>
To worry poor Lazarus away;<br/>
They’d not the power to strike one stroke,<br/>
But flung their whips away.<br/>
<br/>
As it fell out upon one day,<br/>
Poor Lazarus sickened and died;<br/>
There came two angels out of heaven,<br/>
His soul therein to guide.<br/>
<br/>
“Rise up! rise up! brother Lazarus,<br/>
And go along with me;<br/>
For you’ve a place prepared in heaven,<br/>
To sit on an angel’s knee."<br/>
<br/>
As it fell out upon one day,<br/>
Rich Divès sickened and died;<br/>
There came two serpents out of hell,<br/>
His soul therein to guide.<br/>
<br/>
“Rise up! rise up! brother Diverus,<br/>
And come along with me;<br/>
There is a place provided in hell<br/>
For wicked men like thee."<br/>
<br/>
Then Divès looked up with his eyes<br/>
And saw poor Lazarus blest;<br/>
“Give me one drop of water, brother Lazarus,<br/>
To quench my flaming thirst."<br/>
<br/>
“O, was I now but alive again<br/>
The space of one half hour!<br/>
O, that I had my peace again<br/>
Then the devil should have no power."<br/>

As Jacob with travel was weary one day,<br/>
at night on a stone for a pillow he lay;<br/>
he saw in a vision a ladder so high,<br/>
that its foot was on earth and its top in the sky:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain: Alleluia to Jesus, who died on the tree<br/>
and has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,<br/>
and has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.<br/>
<br/>
The ladder is long, it is strong and well-made,<br/>
has stood hundreds of years and is not yet decayed;<br/>
many millions have climbed it and reached Zion's hill,<br/>
many millions by faith now are climbing it still. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Come, let us ascend! All may climb it who will,<br/>
for the angels of Jacob are guarding it still;<br/>
and remember, each step that by faith we pass o'er,<br/>
many prophets and martyrs have trod it before. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And when we arrive at the haven of rest,<br/>
we shall hear the glad words, "Come to me all the blest,<br/>
here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss."<br/>
Who would not want to climb such a ladder as this. Refrain<br/>

As Jonah, issuing from his three days’ tomb,<br/>
At length was cast, uninjured, on the earth;<br/>
So, from the virgin’s unpolluted womb<br/>
Th’incarnate Word, That dwelt there, had His birth:<br/>
For He, Who knew no taint of mortal stain,<br/>
Willed that His mother spotless should remain.<br/>
<br/>
Christ comes, incarnate God, amongst us now,<br/>
Begotten of the Father ere the day:<br/>
And He, to Whom the sinless legions bow,<br/>
Lies cradled, ’midst unconscious beasts on hay:<br/>
And, by His homely swaddling-bands girt in,<br/>
Looses the many fetters of our sin.<br/>
<br/>
Now the new Child of Adam’s race draws nigh,<br/>
To us, the faithful, giv’n: This, this is He<br/>
That shall the Father of eternity,<br/>
The Angel of the Mighty Counsel, be:<br/>
This the eternal God, by Whose strong hands<br/>
The fabric of the world supported stands.<br/>

For me Thou gav’st Thy blood to flow.<br/>

Eternal thanks to Thee I’ll give.<br/>

It doesn't matter if I'm all alone<br/>
As long as I'm with Jesus<br/>
It doesn't matter if I'm weak or strong<br/>
As long as I'm with Jesus<br/>
<br/>
Young or old, high or low<br/>
Wherever I am and wherever I go<br/>
It doesn't matter to me, <br/>
As long as I'm with Jesus<br/>
<br/>
In this life of trouble<br/>
In this world of sorrow<br/>
Somehow I wonder how I'll make it through the day<br/>
And how I'm going to face tomorrow<br/>
But Jesus loves me this I know<br/>
For the Bible tells me so<br/>
What else can I need<br/>
What else can I want to know https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/asmanandwomanweweremade.php

As man and woman we were made<br/>
That love be found and life begun,<br/>
So praise the Lord Who made us two,<br/>
And praise the Lord when two are one;<br/>
Praise for the love that comes to life<br/>
Through child or parent, husband, wife.<br/>
<br/>
Now Jesus lived and gave His love<br/>
To make our life and loving new;<br/>
So celebrate with Him today<br/>
And drink the joy He offers you;<br/>
That makes the simple moment shine<br/>
And changes water into wine.<br/>
<br/>
And Jesus died to live again,<br/>
So praise the love that, come what may,<br/>
Can bring the dawn and clear the skies,<br/>
And waits to wipe all tears away;<br/>
And let us hope for what shall be,<br/>
Believing where we cannot see.<br/>
<br/>
Then spread the table, clear the hall,<br/>
And celebrate till day is done;<br/>
Let peace go deep between us all<br/>
And joy be shared by everyone;<br/>
Laugh and make merry with your friends,<br/>
And praise the love that never ends!<br/>

From fire and foe securely kept,<br/>

And past the perils of the sea,<br/>
Receive us on the blissful shore,<br/>

Because we trust Thy love;<br/>

As oft, with worn and weary feet,<br/>
We tread earth's rugged valley o'er,<br/>
The thought, how comforting and sweet:<br/>
Christ trod this very path before!<br/>
Our wants and weaknesses He knows,<br/>
From life's first dawning to its close.<br/>
<br/>
Does sickness, feebleness or pain<br/>
Or sorrow in our path appear?<br/>
The recollection will remain,<br/>
More deeply did He suffer here:<br/>
His life, how truly sad and brief,<br/>
Filled up with suffering and with grief.<br/>
<br/>
If Satan tempt our hearts to stray<br/>
And whisper evil things within,<br/>
So did he, in the desert way,<br/>
Assail our Lord with thoughts of sin,<br/>
When worn and in a feeble hour<br/>
The tempter came with all his power.<br/>
<br/>
Just such as I, this earth He trod,<br/>
With every human ill but sin;<br/>
And though indeed the very God,<br/>
As I am now so He has been.<br/>
My God, my Savior, look on me,<br/>
With pity, love and sympathy.<br/>
 https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/asonthecrossthesaviorhung.php

As on the Cross the Savior Hung<br/>
And wept, and bled, and died,<br/>
He poured salvation on a wretch<br/>
That languished at his side.<br/>
<br/>
His crimes with inward grief and shame<br/>
The penitent confessed<br/>
Then turned his dying eyes to Christ,<br/>
And thus his prayer addressed:<br/>
<br/>
"Jesus, thou Son and heir of heav'n!<br/>
Thou spotless Lamb of God!<br/>
I see thee bathed in sweat and tears<br/>
And welt'ring in thy blood<br/>
<br/>
"Yet quickly from these scenes of woe,<br/>
In triumph thou shalt rise--<br/>
Burst through the gloomy shades of death,<br/>
And shine above the skies.<br/>
<br/>
"Amid the glories of that world,<br/>
Dear Saviou, think on me,<br/>
and in the vict'ries of thy death<br/>
Let me a sharer be."<br/>
<br/>
His prayer the dying Jesus hears,<br/>
And instantly replies<br/>
"To-day thy parting soul shall be<br/>
With me in Paradise."<br/>

As pants the hart for cooling streams,<br/>
When heated in the chase,<br/>
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee<br/>
And Thy refreshing grace.<br/>
<br/>
For Thee, my God, the living God,<br/>
My thirsty soul doth pine;<br/>
O, when shall I behold Thy face,<br/>
Thou majesty divine?<br/>
<br/>
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?<br/>
Hope still; and thou shalt sing<br/>
The praise of Him Who is thy God,<br/>
Thy health’s eternal spring.<br/>

To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br/>
The God Whom we adore,<br/>
Be glory as it was, is now,<br/>

As powers of good so wonderfully hide us,<br/>

we face the future boldly, come what may;<br/>
at dawn or dusk our God is still beside us,<br/>
to whom we trust, completely, each new day.<br/>
<br/>
Yet still old torments cause consternation;<br/>
through days of fear and grief we have despaired.<br/>
O, give our tortured souls, Lord, your salvation:<br/>
the healing you have promised and prepared.<br/>
<br/>
Then offer us the cup of desolation,<br/>
brimfull of bitterness, and we will stand<br/>
and drink with thanks, in spite of trepidation,<br/>
from such a dearly loved and gracious hand.<br/>
<br/>
Yet should you bring us back to share the gladness<br/>
of this bright world, your sunshine breaking through,<br/>
we would remember times of pain and sadness<br/>
and offer up the whole of life to you.<br/>
<br/>
As evening falls, the candles we have lighted<br/>
will point us through the darkness to your light;<br/>
we long to be with loved ones, reunited;<br/>
we know your love outshines the darkest night.<br/>
As silence deepens, let us hear the chorus<br/>
that harmonizes earth's discordant days,<br/>
poured out from the unseen that lies before us:<br/>
your children's soaring song of endless praise.<br/>
<br/>
By powers of good so faithfully surrounded,<br/>
secure and comforted in spite of fear,<br/>
we live each day with you Lord, unconfounded,<br/>
and go with you to meet the coming year.https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/asroyalbannersareunfurled.php

As royal banners are unfurled,<br/>
the cross displays its mystery:<br/>
the Maker of our flesh, in flesh,<br/>
impaled and hanging helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
Already deeply wounded: see<br/>
his side now riven by a spear,<br/>
and all our sins are swept away<br/>
by blood and water flowing there.<br/>
<br/>
See everything the prophets wrote<br/>
fulfilled in its totality,<br/>
and tell the nations of the world<br/>
our God is reigning from a tree.<br/>
<br/>
This tree, ablaze with royal light<br/>
and with the blood-red robe it wears,<br/>
is hallowed and embellished<br/>
by the weight of holiness it bears.<br/>
<br/>
Stretched like a balance here, his arms<br/>
have gauged the price of wickedness;<br/>
but, hanging here, his love outweighs<br/>
hell's unforgiving bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
The Savior, victim, sacrifice,<br/>
is, through his dying, glorified;<br/>
his life is overcome by death<br/>
and leaps up, sweeping death aside.<br/>
<br/>
We hail the cross, faith's one true hope:<br/>
God's passion set in time and space,<br/>
by which our guilt is blotted out,<br/>
engulfed in such stupendous grace.https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/assaintsofold.php

As saints of old their first fruits brought<br/>

of orchard, flock, and field<br/>
to God the giver all good,<br/>
the source of bounteous yield;<br/>
so we today first fruits would bring:<br/>
the wealth of this good land,<br/>
of farm and market, shop and home,<br/>
of mind, and heart, and hand.<br/>

As shadows cast by cloud and sun<br/>
Flit o’er the summer grass,<br/>
So, in Thy sight, Almighty One,<br/>
Earth’s generations pass.<br/>
And as the years, an endless host,<br/>
Come swiftly pressing on,<br/>
The brightest names that earth can boast<br/>
Just glisten and are gone.<br/>
<br/>
Yet doth the star of Bethlehem shed<br/>
A luster pure and sweet;<br/>
And still it leads, as once it led,<br/>
To the Messiah’s feet.<br/>
O Father, may that holy star<br/>
Grow every year more bright,<br/>
And send its glorious beams afar<br/>
To fill the world with light.<br/>

Under His wings thy defense shall be,<br/>
He with His feathers shall cover thee,<br/>
Cover thee, cover thee,<br/>
He with His feathers will cover thee.<br/>

Fly back, fly back, to thy Father then,<br/>

There'll be singing, there'll be shouting, when we all get home,<br/>
When the day breaks o'er the hills.<br/>

As when the Hebrew prophet raised<br/>
The brazen serpent high,<br/>
The wounded looked and straight were cured,<br/>
The people ceased to die. <br/>
<br/>
So from the Savior on the cross<br/>
A healing virtue flows;<br/>
Who looks to Him with lively faith<br/>
Is saved from endless woes.<br/>
<br/>
For God gave up His Son to death,<br/>
So generous was His love,<br/>
That all the faithful might enjoy<br/>
Eternal life above.<br/>
<br/>
Not to condemn the sons of men<br/>
The Son of God appeared;<br/>
No weapons in His hand are seen,<br/>
Nor voice of terror heard.<br/>
<br/>
He came to raise our fallen state,<br/>
And our lost hopes restore;<br/>
Faith leads us to the mercy seat,<br/>
And bids us fear no more.<br/>
<br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Here’s Watts’ original version:<br/>
<br/>
So did the Hebrew prophet raise<br/>
The brazen serpent high,<br/>
The wounded felt immediate ease,<br/>
The camp forbore to die.<br/>
“Look upward in the dying hour,<br/>
And live," the prophet cries;<br/>
But Christ performs a nobler cure,<br/>
When Faith lifts up her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
High on the cross the Savior hung,<br/>
High in the heav’ns he reigns:<br/>
Here sinners by th’ old serpent stung<br/>
Look, and forget their pains.<br/>
<br/>
When God’s own Son is lifted up,<br/>
A dying world revives;<br/>
The Jew beholds the glorious hope,<br/>
Th’expiring Gentile lives.<br/>

Did the guiding star behold<br/>
As with joy they hailed its light<br/>
Leading onward, beaming bright<br/>
So, most glorious Lord, may we<br/>
Evermore be led to Thee. <br/>
<br/>
As with joyful steps they sped<br/>
To that lowly manger bed<br/>
There to bend the knee before<br/>
Him Whom Heaven and earth adore;<br/>
So may we with willing feet<br/>
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.<br/>
<br/>
As they offered gifts most rare<br/>
At that manger rude and bare;<br/>
So may we with holy joy,<br/>
Pure and free from sin’s alloy,<br/>
All our costliest treasures bring,<br/>
Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Jesus, every day<br/>
Keep us in the narrow way;<br/>
And, when earthly things are past,<br/>
Bring our ransomed souls at last<br/>
Where they need no star to guide,<br/>
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.<br/>
<br/>
In the heavenly country bright,<br/>
Need they no created light;<br/>
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,<br/>
Thou its Sun which goes not down;<br/>
There forever may we sing<br/>
Alleluias to our King!<br/>

Spoken intro:<br/>
Matt: When the world was made life began. It was perfect and whole, but sin 
changed life to death. The Son came forward to return life to its blameless 
state...<br/>
Rick: "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life," He said, so He was sent to 
restore the work of His father, and life seemed to overcome...<br/>
James: But as He hung from the cross and His life ebbed away, He whispered, "It 
is finished." Death once again reigned...<br/>
Brian Fuller: Three days passed as life stood still. Then, life filled the void 
that death had token whole. Life arose victoriously and has been given to us...<br/>
Brian Lewis: Life has been restored to perfection through the One from whom it 
was so freely given. <br/>
<br/>
Fading twilight, dusk is near<br/>
A star emerges bright and clear<br/>
Shining gently from on high<br/>
Is this my guardian angel guiding me tonight? <br/>
<br/>
Lost and hopeless, can't even stand<br/>
Then comes a stranger, a helping hand<br/>
There by your side in your time of need<br/>
Unforseen comfort, a bringer of God's holy peace <br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
Ask for angels (ask Him, ask Him for angels)<br/>
Guiding light (guiding light)<br/>
Ask for angels (ask Him, ask Him for angels)<br/>
Through the night (through the night)<br/>
Ask for angels (ask Him, ask Him for angels)<br/>
God provides (God provides)<br/>
And when you ask for angels<br/>
They are at your side <br/>
<br/>
Praying mother, sleepless child<br/>
Weary traveler, driving through the night<br/>
Unaware of darkness near by<br/>
For there is an angel keeping them in the light <br/>
<br/>
When it seems the world is closing in with all its might<br/>
When it seems you're all alone and must give up the fight<br/>
Just call upon the Lord and He is there to see you through<br/>
He'll send ten thousand angels strong, an army just for you <br/>

What is faith’s foundation strong?<br/>
What awakes my heart to song?<br/>
He Who bore my sinful load,<br/>
Purchased for me peace with God,<br/>

Who is He that makes me wise<br/>
To discern where duty lies?<br/>
Who is He that makes me true<br/>
Duty, when discerned to do,<br/>
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.<br/>
<br/>
Who defeats my fiercest foes?<br/>
Who consoles my saddest woes?<br/>
Who revives my fainting heart,<br/>
Healing all its hidden smart?<br/>
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.<br/>
<br/>
Who is life in life to me?<br/>
Who the death of death will be?<br/>
Who will place me on His right,<br/>
With the countless hosts of light?<br/>
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.<br/>

This is that great thing I know;<br/>
This delights and stirs me so;<br/>
Faith in Him Who died to save,<br/>
Him Who triumphed over the grave:<br/>
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.<br/>

Asleep in Jesus! Blessèd sleep,<br/>
From which none ever wakes to weep;<br/>
A calm and undisturbed repose,<br/>
Unbroken by the last of foes.<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet,<br/>
To be for such a slumber meet,<br/>
With holy confidence to sing<br/>
That death has lost his venomed sting!<br/>

Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest,<br/>

No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour<br/>
That manifests the Savior’s power.<br/>

May such a blessèd refuge be!<br/>
Securely shall my ashes lie<br/>
And wait the summons from on high.<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! time nor space<br/>
Debars this precious “hiding place";<br/>
On Indian plains or Lapland snows<br/>
Believers find the same respose.<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! Far from thee<br/>
Thy kindred and their graves may be;<br/>
But there is still a blessèd sleep,<br/>
From which none ever wakes to weep.<br/>

Assembled at Thy great command,<br/>
Before Thy face, dread King, we stand;<br/>
The voice that marshaled every star<br/>
Has called Thy people from afar.<br/>
<br/>
We meet through distant lands to spread<br/>
The truth for which the martyrs bled;<br/>
Along the line, to either pole,<br/>
The anthem of Thy praise to roll.<br/>
<br/>
Our prayers assist; accept our praise;<br/>
Our hopes revive; our courage raise;<br/>
Our counsels aid; to each impart<br/>
The single eye, the faithful heart.<br/>
<br/>
Forth with Thy chosen heralds come;<br/>
Recall the wandering spirits home;<br/>
From Zion’s mount send forth the sound,<br/>
To spread the spacious earth around.<br/>

Bid unbelief depart;<br/>
With love his soul inflame;<br/>
Take full possession of his heart,<br/>

May stubborn sinners bend<br/>
To thy divine control;<br/>
Constrain the wand'ring to attend.<br/>
And make the wounded whole.<br/>

Tell me not of the pleasures of sin,<br/>
For I now from its bondage am free,<br/>
And the joys of the One crucified<br/>
Have ecclipsed all its follies to me.<br/>
Shall I shrink from the thorns in the way,<br/>
When He lendeth me favor and breath,<br/>
When the thorns He hath borne on His brow,<br/>
When He tasted the sorrows of death? <br/>
<br/>
Though I walk ’mid the sorrows of life,<br/>
And the billows of sin sweep the sky,<br/>
I will trust in my Savior and Friend,<br/>
To His wide open arms I will fly.<br/>
Oh, I fear not the breakers of sin,<br/>
For my anchor is fastened above,<br/>
And the One who has gone on before<br/>
Has enraptured my soul with His love. <br/>
<br/>
Though my path be in sadness and grief,<br/>
And the shadows grow dark on the lea,<br/>
And the last earthly friend prove untrue,<br/>
I will trust in the blood shed for me.<br/>
When around me the sea billows foam,<br/>
Let me hide till the storm passes by,<br/>
From the tempter’s allurement and charm,<br/>
In the Rock that is higher than I. <br/>

I will love you, I will trust you <br/>
You are my strength and you are my song giving me hope and guiding me on <br/>

At all times I will sing of your greatness <br/>
At all times I will sing of your love <br/>
At all times I will sing of your faithfulness <br/>

At all times praise the Lord;<br/>
His promises are sure;<br/>
What if thou doubt? His steadfast Word<br/>
Unchanging shall endure.<br/>
Praise Him when skies are bright,<br/>
And gladness fills thy days;<br/>
Heav’n shames thee with its glorious light,<br/>
And calls thee to His praise.<br/>
<br/>
Praise Him when clouds are dark;<br/>
True faith waits not to prove;<br/>
Tho’ hope no bright’ning gleam may mark,<br/>
His meaning still is love.<br/>
Praise Him when drear and lone<br/>
The shadows ’round thee fall,<br/>
No eye upon Thy sins but One—<br/>
Fear not, He pardons all.<br/>
<br/>
Praise Him when home is sweet,<br/>
As tho’ we ne’er should part;<br/>
But pray—while kindred spirits meet—<br/>
Pray for a thoughtful heart.<br/>
Praise Him when far away<br/>
On mountain or on sea;<br/>
Each place is home to them who pray;<br/>
The Father guardeth thee.<br/>
<br/>
Praise Him when joyful songs<br/>
The saints on earth unite,<br/>
In sacred chorus, with the throngs<br/>
Of angels in the height.<br/>
At all times praise the Lord;<br/>
His promises are sure;<br/>
Fear not, doubt not; His steadfast Word<br/>
Unchanging shall endure.<br/>

At the Name of Jesus, every knee shall bow,<br/>
Every tongue confess Him King of glory now;<br/>
’Tis the Father’s pleasure we should call Him Lord,<br/>
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.<br/>
<br/>
Mighty and mysterious in the highest height,<br/>
God from everlasting, very light of light:<br/>
In the Father’s bosom with the spirit blest,<br/>
Love, in love eternal, rest, in perfect rest.<br/>
<br/>
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight,<br/>
All the angel faces, all the hosts of light,<br/>
Thrones and dominations, stars upon their way,<br/>
All the heavenly orders, in their great array.<br/>
<br/>
Humbled for a season, to receive a name<br/>
From the lips of sinners unto whom He came,<br/>
Faithfully He bore it, spotless to the last,<br/>
Brought it back victorious when from death He passed.<br/>
<br/>
Bore it up triumphant with its human light,<br/>
Through all ranks of creatures, to the central height,<br/>
To the throne of Godhead, to the Father’s breast;<br/>
Filled it with the glory of that perfect rest.<br/>
<br/>
Name Him, brothers, name Him, with love strong as death<br/>
But with awe and wonder, and with bated breath!<br/>
He is God the Savior, He is Christ the Lord,<br/>
Ever to be worshipped, trusted and adored.<br/>
<br/>
In your hearts enthrone Him; there let Him subdue<br/>
All that is not holy, all that is not true;<br/>
Crown Him as your Captain in temptation’s hour;<br/>
Let His will enfold you in its light and power.<br/>
<br/>
Brothers, this Lord Jesus shall return again,<br/>
With His Father’s glory, with His angel train;<br/>
For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow,<br/>
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.<br/>

Years I spent in vanity and pride,<br/>
Caring not my Lord was crucified,<br/>
Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;<br/>
Pardon there was multiplied to me;<br/>
There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
By God’s Word at last my sin I learned;<br/>
Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned,<br/>
Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Now I’ve given to Jesus everything,<br/>
Now I gladly own Him as my King,<br/>
Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!<br/>

Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!<br/>
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!<br/>
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!<br/>

At Cana's wedding, long ago,<br/>
they knew his presence by this sign,<br/>
a virtue none but Christ could show,<br/>
to turn their water into wine:<br/>
And still on us his blessing be<br/>
as in the days of Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
What if the way be far to go<br/>
and life at times a weary load?<br/>
Yet may our hearts within us glow<br/>
as theirs on that Emmaus road:<br/>
The risen Christen become our guest,<br/>
with him to walk, in him to rest.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord of all our life below,<br/>
O risen Lord of realms above,<br/>
eternal joy be theirs to know,<br/>
united in the bond of love:<br/>
One in the faith, with one accord,<br/>
one with each other and the Lord.<br/>

At even, ere the sun was set,<br/>
The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;<br/>
O, with how many pains they met!<br/>
O, with what joy they went away!<br/>
<br/>
Once more ’tis eventide, and we,<br/>
Oppressed with various ills, draw near;<br/>
What if Thyself we cannot see?<br/>
We know that Thou art ever near.<br/>
<br/>
O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;<br/>
For some are sick, and some are sad;<br/>
And some have never loved Thee well,<br/>
And some have lost the love they had.<br/>
<br/>
And some are pressed with worldly care<br/>
And some are tried with sinful doubt;<br/>
And some such grievous passions tear,<br/>
That only Thou canst cast them out.<br/>
<br/>
And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,<br/>
For none are wholly free from sin;<br/>
And they who fain would serve Thee best<br/>
Are conscious most of wrong within.<br/>
<br/>
O Savior Christ, Thou too art man;<br/>
Thou has been troubled, tempted, tried;<br/>
Thy kind but searching glance can scan<br/>
The very wounds that shame would hide.<br/>
<br/>
Thy touch has still its ancient power.<br/>
No word from Thee can fruitless fall;<br/>
Hear, in this solemn evening hour,<br/>
And in Thy mercy heal us all.<br/>

At first I prayed for light:<br/>
Could I but see the way,<br/>
How gladly, swiftly would I walk<br/>
To everlasting day!<br/>
<br/>
And next I prayed for strength:<br/>
That I might tread the road<br/>
With firm, unfaltering feet, and win<br/>
The heavens’ serene abode.<br/>
<br/>
And then I prayed for faith:<br/>
Could I but trust my God,<br/>
I’d live infolded in His peace,<br/>
Though foes were all abroad.<br/>
<br/>
But now I pray for love:<br/>
Deep love to God and man;<br/>
A living love that will not fail,<br/>
However dark His plan.<br/>
<br/>
And light and strength and faith<br/>
Are opening everywhere!<br/>
God waited patiently until<br/>
I prayed the larger prayer.<br/>

Praise to our victorious King,<br/>
Who hath washed us in the tide<br/>
Flowing from his piercèd side;<br/>
Praise we Him, Whose love divine<br/>
Gives His sacred blood for wine,<br/>
Gives His body for the feast,<br/>
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.<br/>

Where the Paschal blood is poured,<br/>
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;<br/>
Israel’s hosts triumphant go<br/>
Through the wave that drowns the foe.<br/>
Praise we Christ, Whose blood was shed,<br/>
Paschal Victim, paschal Bread;<br/>
With sincerity and love<br/>
Eat we Manna from above.<br/>

Mighty Victim from the sky,<br/>
Hell’s fierce powers beneath Thee lie;<br/>
Thou hast conquered in the fight,<br/>
Thou hast brought us life and light;<br/>
Now no more can death appall,<br/>
Now no more the grave enthrall;<br/>
Thou hast opened Paradise,<br/>
And in Thee Thy saints shall rise.<br/>

Paschal triumph, Easter joy,<br/>
Only sin can this destroy;<br/>
From sin’s death do Thou set free<br/>
Souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.<br/>
Hymns of glory and of praise,<br/>

At length there dawns the glorious day<br/>
By prophets long foretold,<br/>
At length the chorus clearer grows<br/>
That shepherds heard of old.<br/>
The day of dawning brotherhood<br/>
Breaks on our eager eyes,<br/>
And human hatreds flee before<br/>
The radiant eastern skies.<br/>
<br/>
For what are sund’ring strains of blood,<br/>
Or ancient caste and creed?<br/>
One claim unites all men in God<br/>
To serve each human need.<br/>
Then here together, brother men,<br/>
We pledge the Lord anew<br/>
Our loyal love, our stalwart faith,<br/>
Our service strong and true.<br/>
<br/>
One common faith unites us all,<br/>
We seek one common goal;<br/>
One tender comfort broods upon<br/>
The struggling human soul.<br/>
To this clear call of brotherhood<br/>
Our hearts responsive ring<br/>
We join the glorious new crusade<br/>
Of our great Lord and King.<br/>

From our trials look away,<br/>
When we all shall meet together,<br/>
At the breaking of the day!<br/>
Refrain<br/>

At the breaking of the day,<br/>
When we anchor on the shore,<br/>
At the breaking of the day,<br/>
When the storms of life are o’er,<br/>
When our sorrow and our sighing,<br/>
Like a dream will pass away,<br/>
When we all shall meet together,<br/>
At the breaking of the day!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, how oft amid the conflict<br/>
And the battle raging high,<br/>
With a faith as clear as noonday<br/>
We behold the vict’ry nigh,<br/>
And we know that with the righteous<br/>
We shall stand in bright array,<br/>
When we all shall meet together,<br/>
At the breaking of the day!<br/>

Endless praise to our Redeemer<br/>
For His all atoning love,<br/>
That prepares for us a mansion<br/>

Of the flow’rs that ne’er decay,<br/>
When we all shall meet together,<br/>
At the breaking of the day!<br/>

Alas! and did my Savior bleed<br/>
And did my Sovereign die?<br/>
Would He devote that sacred head<br/>
For sinners such as I?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,<br/>
And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br/>
It was there by faith I received my sight,<br/>
And now I am happy all the day!<br/>
<br/>
Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, Thine—<br/>
And bathed in its own blood—<br/>
While the firm mark of wrath divine,<br/>
His Soul in anguish stood.<br/>
<br/>
Was it for crimes that I had done<br/>
He groaned upon the tree?<br/>
Amazing pity! grace unknown!<br/>
And love beyond degree!<br/>
<br/>
Well might the sun in darkness hide<br/>
And shut his glories in,<br/>
When Christ, the mighty Maker died,<br/>
For man the creature’s sin.<br/>
<br/>
Thus might I hide my blushing face<br/>
While His dear cross appears,<br/>
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,<br/>
And melt my eyes to tears.<br/>
<br/>
But drops of grief can ne’er repay<br/>
The debt of love I owe:<br/>
Here, Lord, I give my self away<br/>
’Tis all that I can do.<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/atthecrossherstationkeeping.php

At the cross her station keeping,<br/>
stood the mournful mother weeping, <br/>
close to Jesus at the last,<br/>
Through her soul, of joy bereavèd,<br/>
bowed with anguish, deeply grievèd,<br/>
now at length the sword hath passed.<br/>
<br/>
O, that blessed one, grief-laden,<br/>
blessed Mother, blessed Maiden,<br/>
Mother of the all-holy One;<br/>
O that silent, ceaseless mourning,<br/>
O those dim eyes, never turning<br/>
from that wondrous, suffering Son.<br/>
<br/>
Who, on Christ's dear mother gazing,<br/>
in her trouble so amazing,<br/>
born of woman, would not weep?<br/>
Who, on Christ's dear Mother thinking,<br/>
such a cup of sorrow drinking,<br/>
would not share her sorrows deep?<br/>
<br/>
For his people's sins, in anguish,<br/>
there she saw the victim languish,<br/>
bleed in torments, bleed and die.<br/>
Saw the Lord's anointed taken,<br/>
saw her Child in death forrsaken,<br/>
heard his last expiring cry.<br/>
<br/>
In the passion of my Maker,<br/>
be my sinful soul partaker,<br/>
may I bear with her my part;<br/>
of his passion bear the token,<br/>
in a spirit bowed and broken<br/>
bear his death within my heart.<br/>
<br/>
May his wounds both wound and heal me,<br/>
he enkindle, cleanse, and heal me,<br/>
be his cross my hope and stay.<br/>
May he, when the mountains quiver,<br/>
from that flame which burns for ever<br/>
shield me on the judgment day.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, may thy cross defend me,<br/>
and thy saving death befriend me,<br/>
cherished by thy deathless grace:<br/>
when to dust my dust returneth,<br/>
grant a soul that to thee yearneth<br/>
in thy paradise a place.<br/>

While low at the cross of my Jesus I kneel. <br/>

At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords,<br/>
While they drank from golden vessels, as the Book of Truth records,<br/>
In the night, as they reveled in the royal palace hall,<br/>
They were seized with consternation—’twas the Hand upon the wall! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
’Tis the hand of God on the wall!<br/>
’Tis the hand of God on the wall!<br/>
Shall the record be “Found wanting!"<br/>
Or shall it be “Found trusting!"<br/>
While that hand is writing on the wall?<br/>
<br/>
See the brave captive, Daniel, as he stood before the throne,<br/>
And rebuked the haughty monarch for his mighty deeds of wrong;<br/>
As he read out the writing—’twas the doom of one and all,<br/>
For the kingdom now was finished—said the Hand upon the wall!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
See the faith, zeal and courage, that would dare to do the right,<br/>
Which the Spirit gave to Daniel—’twas the secret of his might,<br/>
In his home in Judea, or a captive in the hall,<br/>
He understood the writing of his God upon the wall!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
So our deeds are recorded—there’s a Hand that’s writing now:<br/>
Sinner, give your heart to Jesus, to His royal mandates bow;<br/>
For the day is approaching—it must come to one and all,<br/>
When the sinners’ condemnation will be written on the wall!<br/>

Learning wisdom’s lesson<br/>
From her loving Lord;<br/>
Mary, led by heav’nly grace,<br/>
Chose the meek disciple’s place.<br/>
At the feet of Jesus<br/>

There a humble learner<br/>
Would I choose to be.<br/>
<br/>
At the feet of Jesus,<br/>
Pouring perfume rare,<br/>
Mary did her Savior<br/>
For the grave prepare;<br/>
And, from love the “good work" done,<br/>
She her Lord’s approval won.<br/>
At the feet of Jesus<br/>
Is the place for me,<br/>
There, in sweetest service<br/>
Would I ever be.<br/>
<br/>
At the feet of Jesus,<br/>

Loving hearts, receiving<br/>
Resurrection power,<br/>

Risen now for me,<br/>
I shall sing His praises<br/>

Now I love Him only, all else is loss,<br/>
His grace availed for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I met Jesus when I needed Him most,<br/>
Despair possessed my soul;<br/>
I was under condemnation and lost,<br/>
When Jesus made me whole.<br/>

At the Lamb’s high feast we sing,<br/>
Praise to our victorious King,<br/>
Who hath washed us in the tide<br/>
Flowing from his piercèd side;<br/>
Praise we Him, Whose love divine<br/>
Gives His sacred blood for wine,<br/>
Gives His body for the feast,<br/>
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.<br/>
<br/>
Where the Paschal blood is poured,<br/>
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;<br/>
Israel’s hosts triumphant go<br/>
Through the wave that drowns the foe.<br/>
Praise we Christ, Whose blood was shed,<br/>
Paschal Victim, paschal Bread;<br/>
With sincerity and love<br/>
Eat we Manna from above.<br/>
<br/>
Mighty Victim from the sky,<br/>
Hell’s fierce powers beneath Thee lie;<br/>
Thou hast conquered in the fight,<br/>
Thou hast brought us life and light;<br/>
Now no more can death appall,<br/>
Now no more the grave enthrall;<br/>
Thou hast opened Paradise,<br/>
And in Thee Thy saints shall rise.<br/>
<br/>
Paschal triumph, Easter joy,<br/>
Only sin can this destroy;<br/>
From sin’s death do Thou set free<br/>
Souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.<br/>
Hymns of glory and of praise,<br/>
Father, to Thee we raise;<br/>
Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,<br/>
Ever with the Spirit be.<br/>

https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/atthenameofjesus.php

At the Name of Jesus, every knee shall bow,<br/>
Every tongue confess Him King of glory now;<br/>
’Tis the Father’s pleasure we should call Him Lord,<br/>
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.<br/>
<br/>
Mighty and mysterious in the highest height,<br/>
God from everlasting, very light of light:<br/>
In the Father’s bosom with the spirit blest,<br/>
Love, in love eternal, rest, in perfect rest.<br/>
<br/>
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight,<br/>
All the angel faces, all the hosts of light,<br/>
Thrones and dominations, stars upon their way,<br/>
All the heavenly orders, in their great array.<br/>
<br/>
Humbled for a season, to receive a name<br/>
From the lips of sinners unto whom He came,<br/>
Faithfully He bore it, spotless to the last,<br/>
Brought it back victorious when from death He passed.<br/>
<br/>
Bore it up triumphant with its human light,<br/>
Through all ranks of creatures, to the central height,<br/>
To the throne of Godhead, to the Father’s breast;<br/>
Filled it with the glory of that perfect rest.<br/>
<br/>
Name Him, brothers, name Him, with love strong as death<br/>
But with awe and wonder, and with bated breath!<br/>
He is God the Savior, He is Christ the Lord,<br/>
Ever to be worshipped, trusted and adored.<br/>
<br/>
In your hearts enthrone Him; there let Him subdue<br/>
All that is not holy, all that is not true;<br/>
Crown Him as your Captain in temptation’s hour;<br/>
Let His will enfold you in its light and power.<br/>
<br/>
Brothers, this Lord Jesus shall return again,<br/>
With His Father’s glory, with His angel train;<br/>
For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow,<br/>
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.<br/>

Fain would we Thy Word embrace,<br/>
Live each moment on Thy grace,<br/>
All our selves to Thee consign,<br/>
Fold up all our wills in Thine,<br/>
Think, and speak, and do, and be<br/>
Simply that which pleases Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Hear us, Lord, and that right soon;<br/>
Hear, and grant the choicest boon<br/>
That Thy love can e’er impart,<br/>
Loyal singleness of heart;<br/>

Ave Maria! blessed Maid!<br/>
Lily of Eden's fragrant shade!<br/>
Who can express the love<br/>
that nurtured thee, so pure and sweet,<br/>
making thy heart a shelter meet<br/>
for Jesus' holy Dove!<br/>
<br/>
Ave Maria! Mother blest,<br/>
to whom, caressing and caressed,<br/>
clings the eternal Child;<br/>
favored beyond Archangels' dream,<br/>
when first on thee with tendered gleam<br/>
thy new-born Savior smiled.<br/>
<br/>
Thou wept'st meek Maiden, Mother mild.,<br/>
thou wept'st upon thy sinless Child,<br/>
thy very heart was riven:<br/>
and yet, what mourning matron here<br/>
would deem thy sorrows bought too dear<br/>
by all on this side heaven!<br/>
<br/>
A Son that never did amiss,<br/>
that never shamed his Mother's kiss,<br/>
nor crossed her fondest prayer:<br/>
e'en from the Tree he deigned to bow<br/>
for her his agonized brow,<br/>
her, his sole earthly care.<br/>
<br/>
Ave Maria! thou whose name<br/>
all but adoring love may claim,<br/>
yet may we reach thy shrine;<br/>
for he, thy Son and Savior, vows<br/>
to crown all lowly lofty brows<br/>
with love and joy like thine.<br/>

Sing how He intercedes above<br/>
For those whose sins He bore.<br/>

Sing on your heavenly way,<br/>
Ye ransomed sinners, sing;<br/>
Sing on, rejoicing every day<br/>
In Christ, the eternal King.<br/>
<br/>
Soon shall we hear Him say,<br/>
“Ye blessèd children, come!"<br/>
Soon will He call us hence away,<br/>
To our eternal home.<br/>

There shall each raptured tongue<br/>
His endless praise proclaim;<br/>
And sweeter voices tune the song<br/>
Of Moses and the Lamb.<br/>

and on his praises dwell.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, with what gladness and surprise<br/>
the saints their Savior greet;<br/>
nor will they trust their ears and eyes<br/>
but by his hands and feet,<br/>
<br/>
those hands of liberal love indeed<br/>
in infinite degree,<br/>
those feet still free to move and bleed<br/>
for millions and and for me.<br/>
<br/>
His enemies had sealed the stone<br/>
as Pilate gave them leave,<br/>
lest dead and friendless and alone<br/>
he should their skill deceive.<br/>

O Dead arise! O Friendless stand<br/>
by seraphim adored!<br/>
O Solitude again command<br/>
your host from heaven restored!<br/>

Shout “Hosanna!" while we boldly march along;<br/>
Faithful soldiers here below, only Jesus will we know;<br/>
Shouting “Free salvation!" o’er the world we go.<br/>
<br/>
A cry for light from dying ones in heathen lands;<br/>
It comes, it comes across the ocean’s foam;<br/>
Then haste! Oh, haste to spread the words of truth abroad,<br/>
Forgetting not the starving poor at home, dear home.<br/>

Look up! Look up! The promised day is drawing near,<br/>

Awake! Awake! Fling off the night,<br/>
for God has sent a glorious light,<br/>
and we who live in Christ's new day<br/>
must works of darkness put away.<br/>
<br/>
Awake and sing, with praises strong,<br/>
in psalm and hymn and spirit-song.<br/>
Let love our words and works renew<br/>
with all that's good and right and true.<br/>
<br/>
Let in the light; all sin expose<br/>
to Christ, whose life no darkness knows.<br/>
Before the cross expectant kneel,<br/>
that Christ may judge, and judging, heal.<br/>
<br/>
Then rise as children of the light.<br/>
Be neither proud, nor hide from sight.<br/>
Be careful how you live, and wise <br/>
to sift the truth from cunning lies.<br/>
<br/>
Through Christ give thanks to God, and say<br/>
to other sleepers on the way:<br/>
"Awake, and rise up from the dead<br/>
that Christ may shine on you instead!"<br/>

Awake! awake! O Christian,<br/>
the long dark night is past,<br/>
the Daystar is arising,<br/>
the dawn is near at last;<br/>
the lands so long enshrouded<br/>
in darkness deep and drear<br/>
are longing that the tidings<br/>
of God's love they may hear.<br/>
<br/>
A cry comes o'er the mountains<br/>
and floats upon the breeze,<br/>
from tropic shores and islands,<br/>
and from the Arctic seas.<br/>
'Neath gleaming constellations,<br/>
the pole star in the north,<br/>
from Yukon's ice-bound borders,<br/>
the yearning cry comes forth.<br/>
<br/>
From sea-girt Australasia,<br/>
where in the starry sky<br/>
the Southern Cross burns brightly,<br/>
again there comes the cry.<br/>
In valleys fair and smiling,<br/>
where Christian ne'er hath trod,<br/>
the weary hearts are sighing<br/>
for thee--the unknown God.<br/>
<br/>
Where o'er the slopes of Persia<br/>
the fiery crescent gleams,<br/>
from distant dark Uganda,<br/>
and Niger's deadly streams,<br/>
from China's unloved daughters,<br/>
from flower-crowned Japan,<br/>
the cry is heard, "O tell us,<br/>
God's wondrous love to man."<br/>
<br/>
From lips of suffering sisters,<br/>
'neath India's glowing sun,<br/>
from earth's dark, cruel places,<br/>
from many a weary one,<br/>
the cry is "Come and help us,<br/>
who grope as in the night,<br/>
our eyes are blind and sightless,<br/>
O show us the true light."<br/>
<br/>
"O hear our cry, good Christian,<br/>
and in our sore distress<br/>
reveal to us the Savior,<br/>
who longs to love and bless;<br/>
and then with hearts uplifted,<br/>
and grateful voice we'll raise,<br/>
to Father, Son, and Spirit,<br/>
our joyful song of praise."<br/>

That awful Word, that sovereign Power,<br/>
By whom the worlds were made,<br/>
O happy morn, illustrious hour,<br/>
Was once in flesh arrayed.<br/>
<br/>
Then shone almighty power and love,<br/>
In all their glorious forms,<br/>
When Jesus left His throne above,<br/>
To dwell with sinful worms.<br/>

To dwell with misery below,<br/>
The Savior left the skies,<br/>
And sunk to wretchedness and woe,<br/>
That worthless man might rise.<br/>

Both tuneful heart and song.<br/>

Where life is waking all around,<br/>
Where love’s sweet voices sing,<br/>

Of an eternal spring.<br/>

The shade and gloom of life are fled<br/>
This resurrection day;<br/>
Henceforth in Christ are no more dead,<br/>
The grave hath no more prey.<br/>

In Christ we live, in Christ we sleep,<br/>
In Christ we wake and rise,<br/>
And the sad tears death makes us weep,<br/>
He wipes from all our eyes.<br/>

And every bird and every tree,<br/>
And every opening flower,<br/>
Proclaim His glorious victory,<br/>
His resurrection power.<br/>

The folds are glad, the fields rejoice,<br/>
With vernal verdure spread,<br/>
The little hills lift up their voice<br/>
And shout that death is dead.<br/>

Then wake, glad heart! awake! awake<br/>
And seek Thy risen Lord;<br/>
Joy in His resurrection take,<br/>
And comfort in His Word.<br/>

Awake, my heart, with gladness,<br/>
See what today is done;<br/>
Now, after gloom and sadness,<br/>
Comes forth the glorious Sun.<br/>
My Savior there was laid<br/>
Where our bed must be made<br/>
When to the realms of light<br/>
Our spirit wings its flight.<br/>
<br/>
The foe in triumph shouted<br/>
When Christ lay in the tomb;<br/>
But, lo, he now is routed,<br/>
His boast is turned to gloom.<br/>
For Christ again is free;<br/>
In glorious victory<br/>
He Who is strong to save<br/>
Has triumphed o’er the grave.<br/>
<br/>
This is a sight that gladdens;<br/>
What peace it doth impart!<br/>
Now nothing ever saddens<br/>
The joy within my heart.<br/>
No gloom shall ever shake,<br/>
No foe shall ever take,<br/>
The hope which God’s own Son<br/>
In love for me hath won.<br/>
<br/>
Now hell, its prince, the devil<br/>
Of all their powers are shorn;<br/>
Now I am safe from evil,<br/>
And sin I laugh to scorn.<br/>
Grim Death with all his might<br/>
Cannot my soul affright;<br/>
He is a powerless form,<br/>
Howe’er he rave and storm.<br/>
<br/>
The world against me rageth<br/>
Its fury I disdain;<br/>
Though bitter war it wageth<br/>
Its work is all in vain.<br/>
My heart from care is free,<br/>
No trouble troubles me.<br/>
Misfortune now is play<br/>
And night is bright as day.<br/>
<br/>
Now I will cling forever<br/>
To Christ, my Savior true;<br/>
My Lord will leave me never,<br/>
Whate’er He passeth through.<br/>
He rends Death’s iron chain,<br/>
He breaks through sin and pain,<br/>
He shatters hell’s dark thrall,<br/>
I follow Him through all.<br/>
<br/>
To halls of heavenly splendor<br/>
With Him I penetrate;<br/>
And trouble ne’er may hinder<br/>
Nor make me hesitate.<br/>
Let tempests rage at will,<br/>
My Savior shields me still;<br/>
He grants abiding peace<br/>
And bids all tumult cease.<br/>
<br/>
He brings me to the portal<br/>
That leads to bliss untold,<br/>
Whereon this rhyme immortal<br/>
Is found in script of gold:<br/>
“Who there My cross hath shared<br/>
Finds here a crown prepared;<br/>
Who there with Me hath died<br/>
Shall here be glorified."<br/>

Thy precious time misspent, redeem,<br/>
Each present day thy last esteem,<br/>
Improve thy talent with due care;<br/>

High praise to the eternal King.<br/>

Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake<br/>
I may of endless light partake.<br/>

Heav’n is, dear Lord, where’er Thou art,<br/>
O never then from me depart;<br/>
For to my soul ’tis hell to be<br/>
But for one moment void of Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;<br/>
Disperse my sins as morning dew.<br/>
Guard my first springs of thought and will,<br/>
And with Thyself my spirit fill.<br/>
<br/>
Direct, control, suggest, this day,<br/>
All I design, or do, or say,<br/>
That all my powers, with all their might,<br/>
In Thy sole glory may unite.<br/>
<br/>
I would not wake nor rise again<br/>
And Heaven itself I would disdain,<br/>
Wert Thou not there to be enjoyed,<br/>
And I in hymns to be employed.<br/>
<br/>
Heaven is, dear Lord, where’er Thou art;<br/>
O never then from me depart;<br/>
For to my soul ’tis hell to be<br/>
But for one moment without Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;<br/>
Praise Him, all creatures here below;<br/>
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;<br/>
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br/>

Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue,<br/>
My glory wake and sing,<br/>
And celebrate the holy birth,<br/>
The birth of Israel’s King!<br/>
<br/>
O happy night that brought forth light,<br/>
Which makes the blind to see,<br/>
The Dayspring from on high came down<br/>
To cheer and visit thee.<br/>
<br/>
The careful shepherds with their flocks<br/>
Were watching for the morn,<br/>
But better news from Heav’n was brought;<br/>
Your Savior now is born!<br/>
<br/>
In Bethlehem the Infant lies,<br/>
Within a place obscure,<br/>
Your Savior’s come, O sing God’s praise!<br/>
O sing His praise fore’er.<br/>

A cloud of witnesses around<br/>
Hold thee in full survey;<br/>
Forget the steps already trod,<br/>
And onward urge thy way,<br/>

’Tis God’s all animating voice<br/>
That calls thee from on high;<br/>
’Tis His own hand presents the prize<br/>
To thine aspiring eye.<br/>

Then wake, my soul, stretch every nerve,<br/>
And press with vigor on,<br/>
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,<br/>
And an immortal crown.<br/>

Awake, my soul, to joyful lays,<br/>
And sing thy great Redeemer’s praise;<br/>
He justly claims a song from me -<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how free!<br/>
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how free!<br/>
<br/>
He saw me ruined in the fall,<br/>
Yet loved me notwithstanding all;<br/>
He saved me from my lost estate -<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how great!<br/>
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how great!<br/>
<br/>
Though numerous hosts of mighty foes,<br/>
Though earth and hell my way oppose,<br/>
He safely leads my soul along -<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how strong!<br/>
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how strong!<br/>
<br/>
When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,<br/>
Has gathered thick and thundered loud,<br/>
He near my soul has always stood -<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how good!<br/>
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,<br/>
His lovingkindness, O how good!<br/>
<br/>
Often I feel my sinful heart<br/>
Prone from my Jesus to depart;<br/>
But though I have him oft forgot,<br/>
His lovingkindness changes not.<br/>
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,<br/>
His lovingkindness changes not.<br/>
<br/>
Soon I shall pass the gloomy vale,<br/>
Soon all my mortal powers must fail;<br/>
O! may my last expiring breath<br/>
His lovingkindness sing in death.<br/>
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,<br/>
His lovingkindness sing in death.<br/>
<br/>
Then let me mount and soar away<br/>
To the bright world of endless day;<br/>
And sing with raptures and surprise,<br/>
His lovingkindness in the skies.<br/>
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness,<br/>
His lovingkindness in the skies.<br/>

Join, all my pow’rs the song to raise,<br/>
And morning incense bring.<br/>
<br/>
Among the people of his care,<br/>
And thro’ the nations round,<br/>
Glad sons of praise will I prepare,<br/>
And there his name resound.<br/>
<br/>
Be Thou exalted, O my God!<br/>
Above the starry train;<br/>
Diffuse Thy heav’nly grace abroad,<br/>
And teach the world Thy reign.<br/>

And throng Thy courts above;<br/>

<br/>
How vast is His knowledge, how profound!<br/>
A deep where all our thoughts are drowned;<br/>
The stars He numbers, and their names<br/>
He gives to all those heavenly flames.<br/>
<br/>
Through each bright world above, behold<br/>
Ten thousand thousand charms unfold;<br/>
Earth, air, and mighty seas combine<br/>
To speak His wisdom all divine.<br/>

Its wonders, O what thought can trace!<br/>
Here, wisdom shines forever bright;<br/>

Awake, O Christian, from thy sleep,<br/>
And heed thy brother’s call!<br/>
He cries to thee across the deep,<br/>
Where darkest shadows falls.<br/>
From sin and guilt and wretchedness<br/>
He knows not where to flee;<br/>
Go tell him how the Lord can bless!<br/>
Thy brother calls to thee.<br/>
<br/>
’Mid deepest gloom and darkest night<br/>
He lifts his helpless hands;<br/>
Can aught but Jesus give him light<br/>
Or break his cruel bands?<br/>
Then send, O send the Master’s Word<br/>
Across the wide blue sea,<br/>
Where Macedonia’s cry is heard!<br/>
Thy brother calls to thee.<br/>
<br/>
O save the lost, the sinner turn!<br/>
To blind men send the light!<br/>
O let thy soul with ardor burn<br/>
To lead them to the right;<br/>
Then usher in that glorious day,<br/>
The kingdom yet to be,<br/>
When all shall own the Master’s sway!<br/>
Thy brother calls to thee.<br/>

Awake, O Lord, as in the time of old!<br/>
Come, Holy Spirit, in Thy power and might;<br/>
For lack of Thee our hearts are strangely cold,<br/>
Our minds but blindly groping towards the light.<br/>
<br/>
Doubts are abroad: make Thou these doubts to cease!<br/>
Fears are within: set Thou these fears at rest!<br/>
Strife is among us: melt that strife to peace!<br/>
Change marches onward: may all change blest!<br/>
<br/>
Make us to be what we profess to be;<br/>
Let prayer be prayer, and praise be heartfelt praise;<br/>
From unreality, O set us free,<br/>
And let our words be echoed by our ways.<br/>
<br/>
Turn us, good Lord, and so shall we be turned:<br/>
Let every passion grieving Thee be stilled:<br/>
Then shall our race be won, our guerdon earned,<br/>
Our Master looked on, and our joy fulfilled.<br/>

Why should thy harps be still,<br/>
When He, the Lord, is coming,<br/>
Thy soul with joy to fill?<br/>
Refrain<br/>

Awake, awake, O Zion’s daughter,<br/>
Awake from sorrow’s night;<br/>
Come forth in all thy beauty,<br/>
Arrayed in garments bright.<br/>

Thou hast not been forsaken,<br/>
Tho’ long by foes oppressed;<br/>
Thy tears were not unheeded,<br/>
By Him who loves thee best;<br/>
Oh, look above the shadows<br/>
For Him who yet shall reign;<br/>
Look up with eyes expectant,<br/>
Thy trust is not in vain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
His arm thy foes shall conquer,<br/>
His power their strength shall bind,<br/>

Upon the earth shall stand,<br/>
The light of every nation,<br/>
The pride of every land.<br/>

Awake, our souls! away, our fears!<br/>
Let every trembling thought be gone!<br/>
Awake, and run the heavenly race,<br/>
And put a cheerful courage on.<br/>
<br/>
True, ’tis a strait and thorny road,<br/>
And mortal spirits tire and faint;<br/>
But they forget the mighty God,<br/>
That feeds the strength of every saint.<br/>
<br/>
O mighty God, Thy matchless power<br/>
Is ever new, and ever young;<br/>
And firm endures, while endless years<br/>
Their everlasting circles run.<br/>
<br/>
From Thee, the ever flowing spring,<br/>
Our souls shall drink a fresh supply;<br/>
While such as trust their native strength<br/>
Shall melt away, and droop, and die.<br/>
<br/>
Swift as the eagle cuts the air,<br/>
We’ll mount aloft to Thine abode;<br/>
On wings of love our souls shall fly,<br/>
Nor tire along the heavenly road.<br/>

Awake, thou careless world, awake!<br/>
That final judgment day will surely come;<br/>
What Heav’n hath fixed no time can shake,<br/>
Time never more shall sweep away thy doom.<br/>
Know what the Lord Himself hath spoken<br/>
Shall come at last and not delay:<br/>
Though Heav’n and earth shall pass away,<br/>
His steadfast Word can ne’er be broken.<br/>
<br/>
Awake! thou careless world, awake!<br/>
For none can tell how soon our God may please<br/>
That suddenly that day should break,<br/>
No human wisdom fathoms depths like these:<br/>
O flee earth’s base delights and pride,<br/>
For as the bird is in the snare,<br/>
Or ever of its foe aware,<br/>
So comes that day so long denied.<br/>
<br/>
Yet He in love delayeth long<br/>
That awful day, and grants the sinner space<br/>
To turn away from sin and wrong,<br/>
And mourning seek in time His love and grace.<br/>
He holdeth back that best of days<br/>
Until the righteous shall approve<br/>
Their faith and hope, their constant love;<br/>
So gentle us-ward are His ways!<br/>
<br/>

And those found faithful then shall see<br/>
That glorious morning dawn in love and joy,<br/>
Their Savior comes to set them free,<br/>
Their Judge Himself shall all their bonds destroy;<br/>
He the true Joshua then shall bring<br/>
His people with a mighty hand<br/>
Into their promised fatherland,<br/>
Where songs of victory they shall sing.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, and let us night and day<br/>
Watch for our Lord, and study o’er His Word,<br/>
And in the Spirit ever pray,<br/>
That we be ready when His call is heard;<br/>
Arise, and let us haste to meet<br/>
The Bridegroom standing at the door,<br/>
That with the angels evermore<br/>
We too may worship at His feet.<br/>
<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_a/awakethouspiritwhodidstfire.php

Awake, Thou Spirit, Who didst fire<br/>
The watchmen of the Church’s youth,<br/>
Who faced the foe’s envenomed ire,<br/>
Who witnessed day and night Thy truth,<br/>
Whose voices loud are ringing still<br/>
And bringing hosts to know Thy will.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, let our earnest prayers be heard,<br/>
The prayer Thy Son hath bid us pray;<br/>
For lo, Thy children’s hearts are stirred<br/>
In every land in this our day<br/>
To cry with fervent soul to Thee,<br/>
Oh, help us, Lord! So let it be!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, haste to help ere we are lost!<br/>
Send preachers forth, in spirit strong,<br/>
Armed with Thy Word, a dauntless host,<br/>
Bold to attack the rule of wrong;<br/>
Let them the earth for Thee reclaim,<br/>
Thy heritage, to know Thy Name.<br/>
<br/>
And let Thy Word have speedy course,<br/>
Through every land be glorified,<br/>
Till all the heathen know its force<br/>
And fill Thy churches far and wide.<br/>
Oh, spread the conquest of Thy Word<br/>
And let Thy kingdom come, dear Lord!<br/>

Awaked by Sinai’s awful sound,<br/>
My soul in bonds of guilt I found,<br/>
And knew not where to go;<br/>
Eternal truth did loud proclaim,<br/>
“The sinner must be born again,<br/>
Or sink to endless woe."<br/>
<br/>
Amazed I stood, but could not tell<br/>
Which way to shun the gates of hell,<br/>
For death and hell drew near;<br/>
I strove, indeed, but strove in vain;<br/>
“The sinner must be born again"<br/>
Still sounded in my ear.<br/>
<br/>
When to the law I trembling fled,<br/>
It poured its curses on my head;<br/>
I no relief could find.<br/>
This fearful truth increased my pain;<br/>
“The sinner must be born again"<br/>
O’erwhelmed my tortured mind.<br/>
<br/>
The saints I heard with rapture tell<br/>
How Jesus conquered death and hell,<br/>
And broke the fowler’s snare;<br/>
Yet when I found this truth remain,<br/>
“The sinner must be born again,"<br/>
I sank in deep despair.<br/>
<br/>
But while I thus in anguish lay,<br/>
The gracious Savior passed this way,<br/>
And felt His pity move;<br/>
The sinner, by His justice slain,<br/>
Now by His grace is born again;<br/>
And sings redeeming love.<br/>

Awaked from sleep we fall<br/>
before thee, God of love,<br/>
and chant the praise the angels raise,<br/>
O God of might, above:<br/>
Holy, holy, holy! Thou art God adored!<br/>
In thy pitying mercy show us mercy, Lord.<br/>
<br/>
As at thy call I rise,<br/>
shine on this mind and heart,<br/>
and touch my tongue, that I among<br/>
thy choir may take my part:<br/>
Holy, holy, holy! Thou art God adored!<br/>
In thy pitying mercy show us mercy, Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The Judge will come with speed,<br/>
and each man's deeds be known,<br/>
our trembling cry shall rise on high<br/>
at midnight to thy throne:<br/>
Holy, holy, holy! King of Saints adored!<br/>
In the hour of judgment show us mercy, Lord.<br/>

I wake at dawn <br/>
To a solitary song; <br/>
Yet I know not where <br/>
It comes from- <br/>
<br/>
I walk as if in dream, <br/>
To the source of the stream; <br/>
And I wash in the waters, <br/>
Clear my mind from illusion- <br/>
<br/>
So I look within, <br/>
To my spirit, to my hymn; <br/>
For that is where <br/>
I can find your blessing- <br/>
<br/>
And I smile, but I cry <br/>
Cause' it's been too long; <br/>
Since I've thanked for <br/>
Giving this me this song- <br/>

CHORUS:<br/>
To sing to you, to dance with you<br/>

Where those who love in the vineyard to labor,<br/>
Wait for you and me.<br/>

To the Sunday school rejoicing we will go,<br/>
’Tis a place where all are happy here below.<br/>
Where the way of life we learn to know,<br/>
And seek our home above.<br/>

Away! away! where the angels are bending<br/>
Lightly o’er the house of prayer.<br/>
Glad hymns of praise to the Lord of the Sabbath,<br/>
Sweetly echo there.<br/>

Away! away! for the moments are flying,<br/>
Time for us will soon be o’er;<br/>
This holy day we will try to improve it,<br/>
Ere its light is o’er.<br/>

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,<br/>
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.<br/>
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay,<br/>
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.<br/>
<br/>
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes,<br/>
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes;<br/>
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky<br/>
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.<br/>
<br/>
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay<br/>
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray;<br/>
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,<br/>
And fit us for Heaven to live with Thee there.<br/>

Away with our fears!<br/>
The glad morning appears<br/>
When an heir of salvation was born!<br/>
From Jehovah I came,<br/>
For his glory I am,<br/>
And to him I with singing return.<br/>
<br/>
I sing of thy grace,<br/>
From my earliest days<br/>
Ever near to allure and defend;<br/>
Hitherto thou hast been<br/>
My preserver from sin,<br/>
And I trust thou wilt save to the end.<br/>
<br/>
O the infinite cares,<br/>
And temptations, and snares<br/>
Thy hand has conducted me through!<br/>
O the blessings bestowed<br/>
By a bountiful God,<br/>
And the mercies eternally new!<br/>
<br/>
What a mercy is this,<br/>
What a heaven of bliss,<br/>
How unspeakably happy am I;<br/>
Gathered into the fold,<br/>
With thy people enrolled,<br/>
With thy people to live and to die.<br/>
<br/>
All honour and praise<br/>
To the Father of grace,<br/>
To the Spirit, and Son, I return;<br/>
The business pursue<br/>
He has made me to do,<br/>
And rejoice that I ever was born.<br/>
<br/>
In a rapture of joy<br/>
My life I employ<br/>
The God of my life to proclaim;<br/>
'Tis worth living for, this,<br/>
To administer bliss<br/>
And salvation in Jesus's name.<br/>
<br/>
My remnant of days<br/>
I spend in his praise,<br/>
Who died the whole world to redeem:<br/>
Be they many or few,<br/>
My days are his due,<br/>
And they all are devoted to him.<br/>

Our troubles and tears:<br/>

Away with our sorrow and fear!<br/>
We soon shall recover our home,<br/>
The city of saints shall appear,<br/>
The day of eternity come:<br/>
From earth we shall quickly remove,<br/>
And mount to our native abode,<br/>
The house of our Father above,<br/>
The palace of angels and God.<br/>
<br/>
Our mourning is all at an end,<br/>
When, raised by the life-giving Word,<br/>
We see the new city descend,<br/>
Adorned as a bride for her Lord;<br/>
The city so holy and clean,<br/>
No sorrow can breathe in the air;<br/>
No gloom of affliction or sin,<br/>
No shadow of evil is there.<br/>
<br/>
By faith we already behold<br/>
That lovely Jerusalem here;<br/>
Her walls are of jasper and gold,<br/>
As crystal her buildings are clear;<br/>
Immovably founded in grace,<br/>
She stands as she ever hath stood,<br/>
And brightly her Builder displays,<br/>
And flames with the glory of God.<br/>
<br/>
No need of the sun in that day,<br/>
Which never is followed by night,<br/>
Where Jesus’ beauties display<br/>
A pure and a permanent light:<br/>
The Lamb is their light and their sun,<br/>
And lo! by reflection they shine,<br/>
With Jesus ineffably one,<br/>
And bright in effulgence divine!<br/>
<br/>
The saints in His presence receive<br/>
Their great and eternal reward;<br/>
In Jesus, in Heaven they live,<br/>
They reign in the smile of their Lord:<br/>
The flame of angelical love<br/>
Is kindled at Jesus’ face;<br/>
And all the enjoyment above<br/>
Consists in the rapturous gaze.<br/>

Awhile in spirit, Lord, to Thee<br/>
Into the desert we would flee;<br/>
Awhile upon the barren steep<br/>
Our fast with Thee in spirit keep.<br/>
<br/>
Awhile from Thy temptation learn<br/>
The daily snares of sin to spurn,<br/>
And in our hearts to feel and own<br/>
Man liveth not by bread alone.<br/>
<br/>
O Thou once tempted like as we,<br/>
Thou knowest our infirmity;<br/>
Be Thou our Helper in the strife,<br/>
Be Thou our true, our inward Life.<br/>

The new man all put on.<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Son<br/>
Who comes to set us free,<br/>
With Father, Spirit, ever One,<br/>
Through all eternity.<br/>

The ancient law departs,<br/>
And all its terrors cease;<br/>
For Jesus makes with faithful hearts<br/>
A covenant of peace.<br/>
<br/>
The Light of Light divine,<br/>
True brightness undefiled,<br/>
He bears for us the shame of sin,<br/>
A holy, spotless Child.<br/>
<br/>
His infant body now<br/>
Begins our pains to feel;<br/>
Those precious drops of blood that flow<br/>
For death the victim seal.<br/>
<br/>
Today the Name is Thine,<br/>
At which we bend the knee;<br/>
They call Thee Jesus, Child divine!<br/>
Our Jesus deign to be.<br/>

The angel Gabriel from Heaven came,<br/>
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame;<br/>
“All hail," said he, “thou lowly maiden Mary,<br/>
Most highly favored lady," Gloria!<br/>
<br/>
“For know a blessèd mother thou shalt be,<br/>
All generations laud and honor thee,<br/>
Thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold,<br/>
Most highly favored lady," Gloria!<br/>
<br/>
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head,<br/>
“To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,<br/>
“My soul shall laud and magnify His holy Name."<br/>
Most highly favored lady, Gloria!<br/>
<br/>
Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born<br/>
In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn,<br/>
And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say—<br/>
“Most highly favored lady," Gloria!<br/>

A day, a day of glory!<br/>
A day that ends our woe!<br/>
A day that tells of triumph<br/>
Against our vanquished foe!<br/>
Yield, summer’s brightest sunrise,<br/>
To this December morn:<br/>
Lift up your gates, ye princes,<br/>
And let the Child be born!<br/>

With Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Archangels tell their mirth:<br/>
With Kyrie elëyson<br/>
Men answer upon earth:<br/>
And angels swell the triumph,<br/>
And mortals raise the horn,<br/>
Lift up your gates, ye princes,<br/>
And let the Child be born.<br/>
<br/>
He comes, His throne the manger;<br/>
He comes, His shrine the stall;<br/>
The ox and ass His courtiers,<br/>
Who made and governs all:<br/>
The “House of Bread" His birth-place,<br/>
The Prince of wine and corn:<br/>
Lift up your gates, ye princes,<br/>
And let the Child be born.<br/>
<br/>
Then bar the gates, that henceforth<br/>
None thus may passage win,<br/>
Because the Prince of Israel<br/>
Alone hath enered in:<br/>
The earth, the sky, the ocean<br/>

Lift up your gates, ye princes,<br/>

A debtor to mercy alone, of covenant mercy I sing;<br/>
Nor fear, with Thy righteousness on, my person and off’ring to bring.<br/>
The terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do;<br/>
My Savior’s obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view.<br/>
<br/>
The work which His goodness began, the arm of His strength will complete;<br/>
His promise is Yea and Amen, and never was forfeited yet.<br/>
Things future, nor things that are now, nor all things below or above,<br/>
Can make Him His purpose forgo, or sever my soul from His love.<br/>
<br/>
My name from the palms of His hands eternity will not erase;<br/>
Impressed on His heart it remains, in marks of indelible grace.<br/>
Yes, I to the end shall endure, as sure as the earnest is giv’n;<br/>
More happy, but not more secure, the glorified spirits in Heav’n.<br/>

O that I had wings of angels,<br/>

On the road to Damascus I was hung on the ropes of success<br/>
When You stripped away the mask of life<br/>
They had placed upon the face of death<br/>
<br/>
And I wanna thank You Lord<br/>
More than all of my words can say (I give my life)<br/>
I give my life to sing Your praise<br/>
<br/>
And all those fortunes I hoarded<br/>
They were the well from which my poverty sprang<br/>
Oh they led me to no greater glory and they left me with no less shame<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS<br/>
<br/>
I say I wanna give You glory Lord and I do<br/>
But everything that I could ever find to offer comes from You<br/>
But if my darkness can praise Your light, You give me breath<br/>
And I'll give my life to sing Your praise<br/>

Oh, the Holy Ghost will set your feet a-dancing<br/>
The Holy Ghost will thrill you through and through<br/>
The Holy Ghost will set your feet a-dancing<br/>
And set your heart a-dancing too<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
David danced before the Lord<br/>
He danced with all his might<br/>
His heart was filled with Holy joy<br/>
His spirit was so light<br/>
<br/>
Michal through the window looked<br/>
To criticise did start<br/>
She didn’t know that David<br/>
Had got a dancing heart<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
David danced before the Lord<br/>
To magnify His name<br/>
In God’s almighty presence<br/>
He felt no sense of shame<br/>
The oil of gladness flowed that day<br/>
It quickened every part<br/>
He hadn’t only dancing feet<br/>
He had a dancing heart<br/>
<br/>
Out of Egypt long ago<br/>
The Israelites were fed<br/>
By a mighty miracle<br/>
They all were kept and fed<br/>
Through the Red Sea they were brought<br/>
The waters stood apart<br/>
And God have sister Miriam<br/>
A dance down in her heart<br/>
<br/>
There was a celebration<br/>
Upon the Red Sea shore<br/>
Timbrels rand, desert sands<br/>
Became a dancing floor<br/>
The people sang and praised God there<br/>
And put a dance of love and joy<br/>
A-deep down in their hearts<br/>
<br/>
The prodigal was far away<br/>
Wandering out in sin<br/>
But he came back to father’s house<br/>
And father took him in<br/>
He put a robe upon his son<br/>
The merriment did start<br/>
The prodigal got dancing shoes<br/>
To match his dancing heart<br/>
<br/>
The father’s house with music rang<br/>
To welcome home the son<br/>
Wine was flowing full and free<br/>
All misery was gone<br/>
The elder brother looking on<br/>
Complained it wasn’t fair<br/>
He hadn’t got a dancing heart<br/>
Like all the other’s there<br/>
<br/>
Now many saints are cold and bound<br/>
By unbelief today<br/>
They want the blessings of the Lord<br/>
But worry what men say<br/>
O, let the Lord have full control<br/>
From dead traditions part<br/>
And He will set you free within<br/>
You’ll have a dancing heart<br/>
<br/>
Now in the Bible we can read<br/>
That in the latter days<br/>
Men would leave their first love<br/>
And turn to carnal ways<br/>
But trueborn saints of Jesus<br/>
For the Bridegroom set apart<br/>
Are waiting for His coming<br/>
With a joyful, dancing heart<br/>
https://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_d/dancing_with_the_angels.php

1. There's path with darkness there's a path with light<br/>
2. Old Satan's dark powers are hungry for confusion<br/>

1. And they meet at the old crossroads<br/>
2. Unsatisfied ever greedy for more<br/>

3. Our lanterns of love will guide us though the night<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing with the Angels<br/>
Just like old Daniel in the Lion's den<br/>
The door will be open and the feast spread out before you<br/>
Dancing with the Angels ... while the Lion's roar.<br/>

I heard about a man one day who wasted not his time away. <br/>
He prayed to God every morning noon and night. <br/>
He cared not for the things of Baals. He trusted one who never fails. <br/>
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night. <br/>
<br/>
Chorus: <br/>
Oh, Daniel served the living God while here upon this earth he trod. <br/>
He prayed to God every morning noon and night. <br/>
He cared not for the king's decree. He trusted God who set him free. <br/>
And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night. <br/>
<br/>
They cast him in the lion's den because he would not honor men, <br/>
He prayed to God every morning noon and night. <br/>
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God sent all them safely out.
<br/>
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night. <br/>
<br/>
Chorus: <br/>
<br/>
Now brother, let us watch and pray like Daniel did from day to day. <br/>
He prayed to God every morning noon and night. <br/>
We too can gladly daring do. The things of God he'll take us through. <br/>
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night. <br/>

1. Dark and Thorny Is the Desert<br/>
Thro' which pilgrims make their way;<br/>
But beyond this vale of sorrow<br/>
Lie the realms of endless day<br/>
Dear young soldiers, do not murmur<br/>
At the troubles of the way <br/>
Meet the tempest fight with courage<br/>
Never faint, but watch and pray.<br/>
<br/>
2. Jesus, Jesus, will defend you;<br/>
Trust in Him and Him alone<br/>
He has shed His blood to save you,<br/>
And will bring you to His throne.<br/>
There, on flow'ry fields of pleasure,<br/>
And the hills of endless rest,<br/>
Joy, and peace, and love shall ever<br/>
Reign and triumph in your breast.<br/>
<br/>
3. But methinks a sweeter concert<br/>
Makes the crystal arches ring,<br/>
And a song is heard in Zion<br/>
Which the angles can not sing.<br/>
Who can paint these sons of glory,<br/>
Ransomed souls that dwell on high,<br/>
Who with golden harps forever<br/>
Sound redemption through the sky?<br/>
<br/>
4. There, upon the golden pavement,<br/>
See the ransomed march along!<br/>
While the splendid courts of glory<br/>
Sweetly echo with their song.<br/>
Hail! You happy, happy spirits!<br/>
Welcome to the blissful plain!<br/>
Glory, honor, and salvation!<br/>
Reign, sweet Jesus! Ever reign!<br/>

Hide me, my Father, till the storm is o’er.<br/>

Dark is the night, but cheering is the promise,<br/>

Safe He will lead me through the pathless waters,<br/>

Lyrics:<br/>
<br/>
What good can come of this?<br/>
My desperation runs so deep<br/>
Oh I can not even speak<br/>
I find myself doubting You (doubting You)<br/>
I’m blinded by my pain<br/>
Fear grips my heart with no relief (no relief), and all I know is grief<br/>
I did not ask for this, so I cry out to God<br/>
Are You really there, or do You even care?<br/>
Have You turned Your back on me?<br/>
<br/>
Chorus 1: <br/>
In my darkest hour, You revealed Your power and heard my desperate cry<br/>
You shone Your love around, Now blessings they abound<br/>
When I was weak You showed Your awesome power<br/>
In my darkest hour, You revealed Your power<br/>
<br/>
Is there no other way?<br/>
(Father) Father I know this cross is Mine<br/>
It is not My will but Thine<br/>
I feel so all alone, so I stretch out My hands<br/>
This I know, this is the price that must be paid<br/>
Oh the life that must be laid<br/>
Will they believe in Me?<br/>
So I cry out to You, I know You’re still there<br/>
And I know You care<br/>
Soon they will be free<br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus 1<br/>
<br/>
Bridge:<br/>
Though He died upon that tree, He lives like You and me<br/>
Death could not keep Him in the ground<br/>
Through the tears and through the pain, God brings new life<br/>
Like the sun shines through the rain, the rain<br/>
<br/>
For in my darkest hour, You revealed Your power and heard my desperate cry (my 
cry)<br/>
And reached to dry my eye<br/>
<br/>
Chorus 2:<br/>
In our darkest hour, You revealed Your power<br/>
And heard our desperate cry, and reached to dry our eye<br/>
You shone your love around, now blessings they abound<br/>
When I was weak (when we were weak) You showed Your awesome power<br/>
In my darkest hour<br/>
<br/>
When I’m weak You show Your awesome power<br/>
In my darkest hour, You revealed Your power<br/>
<br/>

Darkly rose the guilty morning,<br/>
When, the King of glory scorning,<br/>
Raged the fierce Jerusalem;<br/>
See the Christ, His cross upbearing,<br/>
See Him stricken, spit on, wearing<br/>
The thorn-plated diadem.<br/>
<br/>
Not the crowd whose cries assailed Him,<br/>
Nor the hands that rudely nailed Him,<br/>
Slew Him on the cursèd tree;<br/>
Ours the sin from Heav’n that called Him,<br/>
Ours the sin whose burden galled Him<br/>
In the sad Gethsemane.<br/>
<br/>
For our sins, of glory emptied,<br/>
He was fasting, lone, and tempted,<br/>
He was slain on Calvary;<br/>
Yet He for His murderers pleaded;<br/>
Lord, by us that prayer is needed,<br/>
We have pierced, yet trust in Thee.<br/>
<br/>
In our wealth and tribulation,<br/>
By Thy precious cross and passion,<br/>
By Thy blood and agony,<br/>
By Thy glorious resurrection,<br/>
By Thy Holy Ghost’s protection,<br/>
Make us Thine eternally.<br/>

Daughter of Zion, from the dust<br/>
Exalt thy fallen head;<br/>
Again in thy Redeemer trust;<br/>
He calls thee from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
Awake, awake, put on thy strength,<br/>
Thy beautiful array;<br/>
The day of freedom dawns at length<br/>
The Lord’s appointed day.<br/>
<br/>
Rebuild thy walls, thy bounds enlarge,<br/>
And send thy heralds forth;<br/>
Say to the South, “Give up thy charge!"<br/>
And “Keep not back, O North!"<br/>
<br/>
They come, they come; thine exiled bands,<br/>
Where’er they rest or roam,<br/>
Have heard thy voice in distant lands,<br/>
And hasten to their home.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, though the universe shall burn,<br/>
And God His works destroy,<br/>
With songs thy ransomed shall return,<br/>
And everlasting joy.<br/>

How great is the Messiah’s joy<br/>
In the salvation of Thy hand!<br/>
Lord, Thou hast raised His kingdom high,<br/>
And giv’n the world to His command.<br/>

Thy goodness grants whate’er He will,<br/>
Nor doth the least request withhold;<br/>
Blessings of love prevent Him still,<br/>
And crowns of glory, not of gold.<br/>

Honor and majesty divine<br/>
Around His sacred temples shine;<br/>
Blessed with the favor of Thy face,<br/>
And length of everlasting days.<br/>
<br/>
Thine hand shall find out all His foes;<br/>
And as a fiery oven glows<br/>
With raging heat and living coals,<br/>
So shall Thy wrath devour their souls.<br/>

Day after day I sought the Lord,<br/>
And waited patiently;<br/>
Until He bent down from His throne,<br/>
And hearkened to my cry.<br/>
<br/>
He drew me from the fearful pit,<br/>
And from the miry clay;<br/>
He placed my feet upon a rock,<br/>
And led me in His way.<br/>
<br/>
He taught my soul a new-made song,<br/>
A song of holy praise,<br/>
All they who see these things, with fear<br/>
Their hopes to God shall raise.<br/>
<br/>
Most blessèd is the man whose hope<br/>
Upon the Lord relies;<br/>
Who follows not the proud, nor those<br/>
That turn aside to lies.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, what wonders hast Thou wrought,<br/>
All number far above!<br/>
Thy thoughts to us-ward overflow<br/>
With mercy, grace, and love.<br/>
<br/>
Show forth Thy mercy, gracious Lord;<br/>
O take it not away!<br/>
Thy loving kindness and Thy truth,<br/>
Let them be still my stay.<br/>
<br/>
For countless sorrows hem me round;<br/>
And my iniquities<br/>
So hold me fast, and drag me down,<br/>
I cannot raise my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
My hairs in number they surpass;<br/>
Hence is my heart dismayed;<br/>
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to rescue me!<br/>
O hasten to my aid.<br/>
<br/>
Let those who seek Thee faithfully<br/>
In peace and joy abide;<br/>
Let those who love Thy grace still say,<br/>
“The Lord be magnified."<br/>
<br/>
Poor am I, and in need; yet God<br/>
Care of my soul doth take.<br/>
Thou art my help; my Savior Thou;<br/>
Lord, no long tarrying make.<br/>
<br/>

Day by day, and with each passing moment,<br/>
Strength I find, to meet my trials here;<br/>
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,<br/>
I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.<br/>
He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure<br/>
Gives unto each day what He deems best—<br/>
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,<br/>
Mingling toil with peace and rest.<br/>
<br/>
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me<br/>
With a special mercy for each hour;<br/>
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,<br/>
He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;<br/>
The protection of His child and treasure<br/>
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;<br/>
“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,"<br/>
This the pledge to me He made.<br/>
<br/>
Help me then in every tribulation<br/>
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,<br/>
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation<br/>
Offered me within Thy holy Word.<br/>
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,<br/>
Ever to take, as from a father’s hand,<br/>
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,<br/>
Till I reach the promised land.<br/>

Day by day the manna fell;<br/>

O to learn this lesson well!<br/>
Still by constant mercy fed,<br/>
Give me Lord, my daily bread.<br/>
<br/>
“Day by day," the promise reads,<br/>
Daily strength for daily needs;<br/>
Cast foreboding fears away;<br/>
Take the manna of today.<br/>
<br/>
Lord! my times are in Thy hand;<br/>
All my sanguine hopes have planned,<br/>
To Thy wisdom I resign,<br/>
And would make Thy purpose mine.<br/>
<br/>
Thou my daily task shalt give;<br/>
Day by day to Thee I live;<br/>
So shall added years fulfill,<br/>
Not my own, my Father’s will.<br/>
<br/>
Fond ambition, whisper not;<br/>
Happy is my humble lot.<br/>
Anxious, busy cares away;<br/>
I’m provided for today.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, to live exempt from care<br/>
By the energy of prayer:<br/>
Strong in faith, with mind subdued,<br/>
Yet elate with gratitude!<br/>

Tell me why you're crying, my son<br/>
I know you're frightened, like everyone<br/>
Is it the thunder in the distance you fear?<br/>
Will it help if I stay very near?<br/>
I am here.<br/>
<br/>
And if you take my hand, my son<br/>
All will be well when the day is done<br/>
And if you take my hand my son<br/>
All will be well when the day is done<br/>
Day is done, day is done, day is done<br/>
Day is done.<br/>
<br/>
You ask me why I'm sighing, my son<br/>
You shall inhereit what mankind has done<br/>
In a world filled with sorrow and woe<br/>
If you ask me why this is so - <br/>
I really don't know<br/>
<br/>
Tell me why you're smiling, my son,<br/>
Is there a secret you can tell everyone?<br/>
Do you know more than those who are as wise?<br/>
Can you see what we all must disguise?<br/>
Through your loving eyes.<br/>

Day is dying in the west;<br/>
Heav’n is touching earth with rest;<br/>
Wait and worship while the night<br/>
Sets the evening lamps alight<br/>
Through all the sky.<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!<br/>
Heav’n and earth are full of Thee!<br/>
Heav’n and earth are praising Thee,<br/>
O Lord most high!<br/>
<br/>
Lord of life, beneath the dome<br/>
Of the universe, Thy home,<br/>
Gather us who seek Thy face<br/>
To the fold of Thy embrace,<br/>
For Thou art nigh.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>

While the deepening shadows fall,<br/>
Heart of love enfolding all,<br/>
Through the glory and the grace<br/>
Of the stars that veil Thy face,<br/>
Our hearts ascend.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When forever from our sight<br/>
Pass the stars, the day, the night,<br/>
Lord of angels, on our eyes<br/>
Let eternal morning rise<br/>
And shadows end.<br/>

Day of God, thou blessèd day,<br/>
At thy dawn the grave gave way<br/>
To the power of Him within,<br/>
Who had, sinless, bled for sin.<br/>
<br/>
Thine the radiance to illume<br/>
First, for man, the dismal tomb,<br/>
When its bars their weakness owned,<br/>
There revealing death dethroned.<br/>
<br/>
Then the Sun of righteousness<br/>
Rose, a darkened world to bless,<br/>
Bringing up from mortal night<br/>
Immortality and light.<br/>
<br/>
Day of glory, day of power,<br/>
Sacred be thine every hour:<br/>
Emblem, earnest, of the rest<br/>
That remaineth for the blest.<br/>

Day of judgment! Day of wonders!<br/>
Hark! the trumpet’s awful sound,<br/>
Louder than a thousand thunders,<br/>
Shakes the vast creation round!<br/>
How the summons wilt the sinner’s heart confound! <br/>
<br/>
See the Judge, our nature wearing,<br/>
Clothed in majesty divine!<br/>
You who long for His appearing<br/>
Then shall say, “This God is mine!"<br/>
Gracious Savior, own me in that day for Thine!<br/>
<br/>
At His call the dead awaken,<br/>
Rise to life from earth and sea;<br/>
All the powers of nature shaken<br/>
By His look, prepares to flee.<br/>
Careless sinner, what will then become of thee!<br/>
<br/>
Horrors, past imagination,<br/>
Will surprise your trembling heart,<br/>
When you hear your condemnation,<br/>
“Hence, accursed wretch, depart!<br/>
Thou, with Satan and his angels, have thy part!"<br/>
<br/>
Satan, who now tries to please you,<br/>
Lest you timely warning take,<br/>
When that word is past, will seize you,<br/>
Plunge you in the burning lake:<br/>
Think, poor sinner, thy eternal all’s at stake.<br/>
<br/>
But to those who have confessèd,<br/>
Loved and served the Lord below,<br/>
He will say, “Come near, ye blessèd,<br/>
See the kingdom I bestow;<br/>
You forever shall My love and glory know."<br/>
<br/>
Under sorrows and reproaches,<br/>
May this thought your courage raise!<br/>
Swiftly God’s great day approaches,<br/>
Sighs shall then be changed to praise.<br/>
We shall triumph when the world is in a blaze.<br/>

The day of redemption hath come with a song—<br/>
The song of redemption from sin so strong.<br/>
The angels first chanted it over a hill;<br/>
As Christmas returneth it echoes still.<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hail! Hail! day of redemption!<br/>
Hark the angel chorus rings!<br/>
Hail! Hail! day of redemption!<br/>
Bow before the King of kings!<br/>
<br/>
Redemption most wonderful! Gift from the sky,<br/>
Redeemer most gentle, so low to lie!<br/>
O herald so glorious sent from above,<br/>
To speak to the shepherds of God’s great love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O marvel of tenderness! Marvel of light!<br/>
The King from the glory, so wondrous bright!<br/>
Is resting all quietly, pillowed on hay,<br/>
And gone is earth’s darkness! Behold! ’tis day!<br/>

Day of wrath, O day of mourning!<br/>
See fulfilled the prophet’s warning,<br/>
Heaven and earth in ashes burning.<br/>
Oh, what fear man’s bosom rendeth<br/>
When from Heav’n the Judge descendeth<br/>
On Whose sentence all dependeth!<br/>
<br/>
Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,<br/>
Through earth’s sepulchers it ringeth,<br/>
All before the throne it bringeth.<br/>
Death is struck and nature quaking;<br/>
All creation is awaking,<br/>
To its Judge an answer making.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, the book, exactly worded,<br/>
Wherein all hath been recorded;<br/>
Thence shall judgment be awarded.<br/>
When the Judge His seat attaineth<br/>
And each hidden deed arraigneth,<br/>
Nothing unavenged remaineth.<br/>
<br/>
What shall I, frail man, be pleading?<br/>
Who for me be interceding<br/>
When the just are mercy needing?<br/>
King of majesty tremendous,<br/>
Who dost free salvation send us,<br/>
Fount of pity, then befriend us.<br/>
<br/>
Think, good Jesus, my salvation<br/>
Caused Thy wondrous incarnation;<br/>
Leave me not to reprobation!<br/>
Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,<br/>
On the cross of suffering bought me;<br/>
Shall such grace be vainly brought me?<br/>
<br/>
Righteous Judge, for sin’s pollution<br/>
Grant Thy gift of absolution<br/>
Ere that day of retribution!<br/>
Guilty, now I pour my moaning,<br/>
All my shame with anguish owning:<br/>
Spare, O God, Thy suppliant groaning!<br/>
<br/>
From that sinful woman shriven,<br/>
From the dying thief forgiven,<br/>
Thou to me a hope hast given.<br/>
Worthless are my prayers and sighing;<br/>
Yet, good Lord, in grace complying,<br/>
Rescue me from fires undying.<br/>
<br/>
With Thy favored sheep, oh, place me!<br/>
Nor among the goats abase me,<br/>
But to Thy right hand upraise me.<br/>
While the wicked are confounded,<br/>
Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,<br/>
Call me, with Thy saints surrounded.<br/>
<br/>
Low I kneel with heart submission,<br/>
See, like ashes, my contrition;<br/>
Help me in my last condition!<br/>
Day of sorrow, day of weeping,<br/>
When, in dust no longer sleeping,<br/>
Man awakes in Thy dread keeping!<br/>
<br/>
This additional verse may be used with tunes of a different meter:<br/>
<br/>
To the rest Thou didst prepare me<br/>
On Thy cross; O Christ, upbear me!<br/>
Spare, O God, in mercy spare me!<br/>

Victor he comes in majesty, revealing<br/>
promise of life and liberty to mortals;<br/>

praise him with dances.<br/>

Hail him the Monarch, Ruler of creation;<br/>
prince and powers, bow your heads before him,<br/>

Days and moments quickly flying<br/>
Blend the living with the dead;<br/>
Soon our bodies will be lying<br/>
Each within its narrow bed.<br/>
<br/>
Soon our souls to God Who gave them<br/>
Will have sped their rapid flight:<br/>
Able now by grace to save them,<br/>
O that, while we can, we might!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, infinite Redeemer,<br/>
Maker of this mighty frame,<br/>
Teach, O teach us to remember<br/>
What we are, and whence we came.<br/>
<br/>
Whence we came and whither wending,<br/>
Soon we must through darkness go,<br/>
To inherit bliss unending,<br/>
Or eternity of woe.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, merciful Redeemer,<br/>
Rouse dead souls to hear Thy voice;<br/>
Wake, O wake each idle dreamer<br/>
Now to make the eternal choice.<br/>
<br/>
Soon before the Judge all glorious<br/>
We with all the dead shall stand:<br/>
Savior, over death victorious,<br/>
Place us then on Thy right hand.<br/>

Lyrics:<br/>
<br/>
These are the days of Elijah<br/>
Declaring the Word of the Lord<br/>
And these are the days of your servant, Moses<br/>
Righteousness being restored<br/>
And though these are days of great trials<br/>
Of famine and darkness and sword<br/>
Still we are the voice in the desert crying<br/>
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord"<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
Behold, He comes<br/>
Riding on the clouds<br/>
Shining like the sun<br/>
At the trumpet call<br/>
Lift your voice<br/>
It's the year of Jubilee<br/>
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes<br/>
<br/>
These are the days of Ezekiel<br/>
The dry bones becoming as flesh<br/>
And these are the days of your servant, David<br/>
Rebuilding a temple of praise<br/>
And these are the days of the harvest<br/>
The fields are as white in the world<br/>
And we are the laborers in your vineyard<br/>
Declaring the Word of the Lord<br/>
<br/>
Repeat Chorus (x2)<br/>
<br/>
Lift your voice<br/>
It's the year of Jubilee<br/>
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes<br/>

Dayspring of eternity!<br/>
Hide no more Thy radiant dawning!<br/>
Light from light’s exhaustless sea,<br/>
Shine on us afresh this morning!<br/>
And dispel with glorious might<br/>
All our night.<br/>
<br/>
Let Thy mercies’ morning dew<br/>
Rouse our conscience from its blindness:<br/>
Gladden life’s dry plains anew<br/>
With the rivers of Thy kindness;<br/>
Water daily us Thy flock<br/>
From the rock.<br/>
<br/>
Let the glow of love destroy<br/>
Cold obedience faintly given,<br/>
Wake our hearts to love and joy<br/>
With the flushing eastern heaven;<br/>
Let us truly rise ere yet<br/>
Life hath set.<br/>
<br/>
Through this dark and tearful place<br/>
Never be Thy light denied us.<br/>
O Thou glorious Sun of grace,<br/>
To yon world of gladness guide us,<br/>
When to joys that never end<br/>
We ascend!<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Thou Dayspring from on high<br/>
Grant that at Thy next appearing<br/>
We who in the graves do lie<br/>
May arise, Thy summons hearing,<br/>
And rejoice in our new life,<br/>
Far from strife.<br/>
<br/>
Light us to those heavenly spheres,<br/>
Sun of grace, in glory shrouded;<br/>
Lead us through this vale of tears<br/>
To the land whose days unclouded,<br/>
Purest joy, and perfect peace<br/>
Never cease.<br/>
