But wherefore do not you a mightier way	1
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?	1
And fortify yourself in your decay	1
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	1
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,	1
And many maiden gardens yet unset	1
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,	1
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	1
So should the lines of life that life repair,	1
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,	1
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,	1
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.	1
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,	1
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.	1

Who will believe my verse in time to come,	1
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?	1
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb	1
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.	1
If I could write the beauty of your eyes	1
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,	1
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:	1
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'	1
So should my papers yellow'd with their age	1
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,	1
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	1
And stretched metre of an antique song:	1
But were some child of yours alive that time,	1
You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.	1

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?	1
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	1
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	1
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:	1
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	1
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	1
And every fair from fair sometime declines,	1
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	1
But thy eternal summer shall not fade	1
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;	1
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	1
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:	1
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	1
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.	1

Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,	1
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;	1
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,	1
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;	1
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,	1
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,	1
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;	1
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:	1
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,	1
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;	1
Him in thy course untainted do allow	1
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.	1
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,	1
My love shall in my verse ever live young.	1

A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted	1
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;	1
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted	1
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;	1
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,	1
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;	1
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,	1
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.	1
And for a woman wert thou first created;	1
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,	1
And by addition me of thee defeated,	1
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.	1
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,	1
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.	1

So is it not with me as with that Muse	1
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,	1
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	1
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	1
Making a couplement of proud compare,	1
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,	1
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare	1
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.	1
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,	1
And then believe me, my love is as fair	1
As any mother's child, though not so bright	1
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:	1
Let them say more than like of hearsay well;	1
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.	1

My glass shall not persuade me I am old,	1
So long as youth and thou are of one date;	1
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,	1
Then look I death my days should expiate.	1
For all that beauty that doth cover thee	1
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,	1
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:	1
How can I then be elder than thou art?	1
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary	1
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;	1
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary	1
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	1
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;	1
Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.	1

As an unperfect actor on the stage	1
Who with his fear is put besides his part,	1
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	1
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.	1
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say	1
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	1
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,	1
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.	1
O, let my books be then the eloquence	1
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	1
Who plead for love and look for recompense	1
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.	1
O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:	1
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.	1

Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	1
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;	1
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	1
And perspective it is the painter's art.	1
For through the painter must you see his skill,	1
To find where your true image pictured lies;	1
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	1
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.	1
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:	1
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me	1
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	1
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;	1
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;	1
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.	1

Let those who are in favour with their stars	1
Of public honour and proud titles boast,	1
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,	1
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.	1
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread	1
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	1
And in themselves their pride lies buried,	1
For at a frown they in their glory die.	1
The painful warrior famoused for fight,	1
After a thousand victories once foil'd,	1
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	1
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:	1
Then happy I, that love and am beloved	1
Where I may not remove nor be removed.	1

Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage	1
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,	1
To thee I send this written embassage,	1
To witness duty, not to show my wit:	1
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	1
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,	1
But that I hope some good conceit of thine	1
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;	1
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	1
Points on me graciously with fair aspect	1
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,	1
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:	1
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;	1
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.	1

Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,	1
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;	1
But then begins a journey in my head,	1
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:	1
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,	1
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	1
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,	1
Looking on darkness which the blind do see	1
Save that my soul's imaginary sight	1
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,	1
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,	1
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.	1
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,	1
For thee and for myself no quiet find.	1

How can I then return in happy plight,	1
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?	1
When day's oppression is not eased by night,	1
But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?	1
And each, though enemies to either's reign,	1
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;	1
The one by toil, the other to complain	1
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.	1
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright	1
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:	1
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,	1
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.	1
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	1
And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.	1

When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,	1
I all alone beweep my outcast state	1
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries	1
And look upon myself and curse my fate,	1
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	1
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,	1
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,	1
With what I most enjoy contented least;	1
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,	1
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,	1
Like to the lark at break of day arising	1
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;	1
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	1
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.	1

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	1
I summon up remembrance of things past,	1
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,	1
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:	1
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,	1
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,	1
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,	1
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:	1
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,	1
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	1
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	1
Which I new pay as if not paid before.	1
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,	1
All losses are restored and sorrows end.	1

A babe lies in the cradle,	0
a little babe so dear,	0
with noble light he shineth	0
as shines a mirror clear,	0
this little babe so dear.	0
The babe within the cradle	0
is Jesus Christ our Lord;	0
to us all peace and amity	0
at this good time afford,	0
thou Jesus Christ our Lord!	0
Whoso would rock the cradle	0
where lies the gentle child,	0
a lowly heart must lead him,	0
by passions undefiled,	0
as Mary pure and mild.	0
O Jesus, babe beloved!	0
O Jesus, babe divine!	0
How mighty is thy wondrous love!	0
Fill thou this heart of mine	0
with that great love of thine!	0

There's a beautiful home, far over the sea,	0
There are mansions of bliss, for you and for me,	0
Oh that beautiful home, so wonderf'ly fair,	0
That the savior for me, has gone to pre- pare.	0

"There's a beautiful home", far over the sea,	0
"There's a beautiful home", for you and for me,	0
"And it's glittering pow'r", the sun out- shines,	0
"And that beautiful home", someday shall be mine.	0
In that beautiful home, a crown I shall wear,	0
When the glorified throne, that glory to share,	0
But the joys of that home, can never be known,	0
'Till the savior we see, upon his white throne.	0

Each day I'll do a golden deed,	0
By helping those who are in need;	0
My life on earth is but a span,	0
And so I'll do the best I can.	0
Life's evening sun is sinking low,	0
A few more days, and I must go	0
To meet the deeds that I have done,	0
Where there will be no setting sun.	0
To be a child of God each day,	0
My light must shine along the way;	0
I'll sing His praise while ages roll,	0
And strive to help some troubled soul.	0
The only life that will endure,	0
Is one that's kind and good and pure;	0
And so for God I'll take my stand,	0
Each day I'll lend a helping hand.	0
I'll help someone in time of need,	0
And journey on with rapid speed;	0
I'll help the sick and poor and weak,	0
And words of kindness to them speak.	0
While going down life's weary road,	0
I'll try to lift some trav'ler's load;	0
I'll try to turn the night to day,	0
Make flowers bloom along the way.	0

Years have flown by, memories have remained,	0
I've gone through situations that no one can explain,	0
I thought in my mind that this would never attend,	0
I have gone through the loss of a very close friend,	0
Trying to be strong and hold back the tears,	0
walking by others who have a face of fear,	0
With arms wide open and love poured out,	0
This could be the end I have no doubt,	0
I don't know where to go or what to do, I	0
 can't let go of the things I'm going through.	0
Pain and Fear is always in my way,	0
It hurts to know all the things in life that change,	0
Good or Bad.You'll always become stronger,	0
Let God take control.For he will make you whole,	0
He is your life and living water,	0
Even a loving Father,	0
He'll make you have a Better Day.	0
I went to school that very next day,	0
It was hard to realize that life was so short away,	0
It was just so hard to see, My heart was beating so quickly,	0
they were their one minute gone the next,	0
The bell rang we all went to class,	0
Not a word was spoken it went by so fast,	0
We all bowed our heads tears rolled down our eyes,	0
For God was with us right by our sides,	0
I just can't explain, just can't explain the way I feel.	0
Pain and Fear is always in my way,	0
It hurts to know all the things in life that change,	0
Good or Bad.You'll always become stronger,	0
Let God take control.For he will make you whole,	0
He is your life and living water,	0
Even a loving Father,	0
He'll make you have a better day.	0
For He will make you whole,	0
and it will be a Better Day.A Better Day.	0

A Bible Christian I will be,	0
For Christ has done so much for me;	0
Then how could I my Lord deny,	0
And on the words of men rely?	0
The Bible’s good enough for me,	0
The Bible’s truth my creed shall be;	0
From human creeds I turn away,	0
I stand for Christ alone today.	0
Tho’ many follow human plans,	0
Believe the creeds set up by man;	0
No other creed have I today	0
Than Christ, who is the Truth, the Way.	0
The Word by inspiration giv’n,	0
The chart that points the way to Heav’n;	0
On this I dare and will depend,	0
And with my life its truth defend.	0
Believe in Christ, repent of sin,	0
Confess your faith, and peace you’ll win;	0
Then ’neath the water with Him go,	0
And you His peace and joy shall know.	0

When I came into this world, I just can't recall	0
I don't remember anything about my birth at all	0
But one day, on my knees in prayer, I just never will forget	0
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget	0
Oh, but to the world it made no difference,	0
Some might even frown	0
But the angels, they rejoiced,	0
When my name was written down	0
Unworthy of His mercy, but yet He paid the debt	0
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget	0
Well, it never made the papers, it never made the evening news	0
When I took off the old man, and I put on the new	0
My sins were cast into forgetfulness, as the East is from the West	0
I've got a birth I can't remember, and one I can't forget	0

A brighter dawn is breaking,	0
and earth with praise is waking;	0
for thou, O King most highest,	0
the power of death defiest;	0
and thou hast come victorious,	0
with risen Body glorious,	0
who now for ever livest,	0
and life abundant givest.	0
O free the world from blindness,	0
and fill the world with kindness,	0
give sinners resurrection,	0
bring striving to perfection;	0
in sickness give us healing,	0
in doubt thy clear revealing,	0
that praise to thee be given	0
in earth as in thy heaven.	0

Up, away to the harvest field,	0
Gather in the golden yield;	0
Gird your armor and faithful be,	0
For the Master calleth thee.	0
Thrust your sickle in, the harvest time is here,	0
Labor with your might, the judgment day is near;	0
Thrust your sickle in, the grain is falling fast,	0
Haste, ere harvest time is past.	0
Always take with you faith’s bright shield,	0
And your sickle bravely wield;	0
Stand against cunning foes you see,	0
For the Master calleth thee.	0
Keep uplifted the word of truth,	0
Spreading light to hopeful youth;	0
Bowed to Him must be every knee,	0
For the Master calleth thee.	0
Take with you holy peace and love,	0
Lift despairing souls above;	0
Toil to make sinful mortals free,	0
For the Master calleth thee.	0

Softly the evening vespers	0
Hallow the closing day;	0
Sweetly the Savior whispers,	0
“Come to the throne and pray."	0
Softly I hear Him calling,	0
Calling at close of day;	0
Sweetly His tones are falling,	0
“Come to the throne and pray."	0
Come, ere the shadows lengthen,	0
Bring Him thy burdened heart;	0
Come where His grace may strengthen,	0
Come from thy cares apart.	0
Smiles of His love await thee,	0
Lighting His lovely face;	0
Just to behold His beauty,	0
Dwell in the secret place.	0
Boldly we may approach Him,	0
Mercy and grace to own;	0
Tempted like us, He bid us	0
Come to the Father’s throne.	0

A charge to keep I have,	0
a God to glorify,	0
a never-dying soul to save,	0
and fit it for the sky.	0
To serve the present age,	0
my calling to fulfill;	0
O may it all my powers engage	0
to do my Master's will!	0
Arm me with jealous care,	0
as in thy sight to live,	0
and O, thy servant, Lord, prepare	0
a strict account to give!	0
Help me to watch and pray,	0
and on thyself rely;	0
assured, if I my trust betray,	0
I shall forever die.	0

A Child is born in Bethlehem,	0
in Bethlehem.	0
And gladness fills Jerusalem,	0
Allelujah, allelujah!	0
A lowly manger shelters Him,	0
This Holy Boy.	0
God's angels sing above with joy,	0
Allelujah, allelujah!	0
We now give thanks eternally,	0
Eternally.	0
to God, the Holy Trinity,	0
Allelujah, allelujah!	0
The work which His goodness began,	0
The arm of His strength will complete;	0
His promise is Yea and Amen,	0
And never was forfeited yet.	0
Things future, nor things that are now,	0
Not all things below or above,	0
Can make Him His purpose forego,	0
Or sever my soul from His love.	0
My name from the palms of His hands	0
Eternity will not erase;	0
Imprest on His heart, it remains	0
In marks of indelible grace.	0
Yes! I to the end shall endure,	0
As sure as the earnest is giv'n;	0
More happy, but not more secure,	0
When all earthly ties have been riv'n.	0
