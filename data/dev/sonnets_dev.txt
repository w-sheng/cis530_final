But wherefore do not you a mightier way	1
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?	1
And fortify yourself in your decay	1
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	1
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,	1
And many maiden gardens yet unset	1
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,	1
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	1
So should the lines of life that life repair,	1
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,	1
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,	1
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.	1
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,	1
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.	1

Who will believe my verse in time to come,	1
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?	1
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb	1
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.	1
If I could write the beauty of your eyes	1
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,	1
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:	1
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'	1
So should my papers yellow'd with their age	1
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,	1
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	1
And stretched metre of an antique song:	1
But were some child of yours alive that time,	1
You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.	1

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?	1
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	1
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	1
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:	1
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	1
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	1
And every fair from fair sometime declines,	1
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	1
But thy eternal summer shall not fade	1
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;	1
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	1
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:	1
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	1
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.	1

Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,	1
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;	1
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,	1
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;	1
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,	1
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,	1
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;	1
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:	1
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,	1
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;	1
Him in thy course untainted do allow	1
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.	1
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,	1
My love shall in my verse ever live young.	1

A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted	1
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;	1
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted	1
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;	1
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,	1
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;	1
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,	1
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.	1
And for a woman wert thou first created;	1
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,	1
And by addition me of thee defeated,	1
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.	1
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,	1
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.	1

So is it not with me as with that Muse	1
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,	1
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	1
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	1
Making a couplement of proud compare,	1
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,	1
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare	1
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.	1
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,	1
And then believe me, my love is as fair	1
As any mother's child, though not so bright	1
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:	1
Let them say more than like of hearsay well;	1
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.	1

My glass shall not persuade me I am old,	1
So long as youth and thou are of one date;	1
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,	1
Then look I death my days should expiate.	1
For all that beauty that doth cover thee	1
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,	1
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:	1
How can I then be elder than thou art?	1
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary	1
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;	1
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary	1
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	1
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;	1
Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.	1

As an unperfect actor on the stage	1
Who with his fear is put besides his part,	1
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	1
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.	1
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say	1
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	1
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,	1
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.	1
O, let my books be then the eloquence	1
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	1
Who plead for love and look for recompense	1
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.	1
O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:	1
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.	1

Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	1
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;	1
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	1
And perspective it is the painter's art.	1
For through the painter must you see his skill,	1
To find where your true image pictured lies;	1
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	1
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.	1
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:	1
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me	1
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	1
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;	1
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;	1
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.	1

Let those who are in favour with their stars	1
Of public honour and proud titles boast,	1
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,	1
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.	1
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread	1
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	1
And in themselves their pride lies buried,	1
For at a frown they in their glory die.	1
The painful warrior famoused for fight,	1
After a thousand victories once foil'd,	1
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	1
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:	1
Then happy I, that love and am beloved	1
Where I may not remove nor be removed.	1

Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage	1
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,	1
To thee I send this written embassage,	1
To witness duty, not to show my wit:	1
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	1
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,	1
But that I hope some good conceit of thine	1
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;	1
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	1
Points on me graciously with fair aspect	1
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,	1
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:	1
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;	1
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.	1

Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,	1
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;	1
But then begins a journey in my head,	1
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:	1
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,	1
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	1
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,	1
Looking on darkness which the blind do see	1
Save that my soul's imaginary sight	1
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,	1
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,	1
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.	1
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,	1
For thee and for myself no quiet find.	1

How can I then return in happy plight,	1
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?	1
When day's oppression is not eased by night,	1
But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?	1
And each, though enemies to either's reign,	1
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;	1
The one by toil, the other to complain	1
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.	1
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright	1
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:	1
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,	1
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.	1
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	1
And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.	1

When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,	1
I all alone beweep my outcast state	1
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries	1
And look upon myself and curse my fate,	1
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	1
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,	1
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,	1
With what I most enjoy contented least;	1
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,	1
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,	1
Like to the lark at break of day arising	1
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;	1
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	1
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.	1

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	1
I summon up remembrance of things past,	1
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,	1
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:	1
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,	1
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,	1
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,	1
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:	1
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,	1
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	1
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	1
Which I new pay as if not paid before.	1
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,	1
All losses are restored and sorrows end.	1
