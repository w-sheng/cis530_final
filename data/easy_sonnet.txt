My octopus, you make me want to write.
How I love the way you fly, swim and drool,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the pleasant joule.

Let me compare you to a busy arch?
You are more deadly and more amazing.
Weak clouds dull the secret flowers of March,
And the springtime has the blazing glazing.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your bleak arms, elbows and toenails.
Thinking of your fleek elbows fills my days.
My love for you is emotional, pales

Now I must away with a dizzy heart,
Remember my peak words whilst we're apart.
