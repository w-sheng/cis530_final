You should describe your evaluation metric in a markdown file called scoring.md. This should give a formal definition of your metric, and relevant citations to where it was introduced. Your scoring.md file should also show how to run your evaluation script on the command line (with example arguments, and example output). The scoring.md file should say whether higher scores are better, or lower scores are better.
